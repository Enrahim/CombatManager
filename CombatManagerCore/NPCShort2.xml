    <SpecialAbilities>Bloodline Tattoos (Ex) Isabella's bonus bloodline spells are represented by tattoos on her body and are enhanced by her Varisian Tattoo feat, even if they belong to a different school. Create Spell Tattoo (Su) Isabella can create a spell tattoo (Inner Sea Magic 16) with a touch as a standard action once per day. The recipient must be willing to receive the tattoo, which is a silent, spell completion item that only the bearer can activate with a touch. The spell tattoo must be of a spell she knows that has no material or focus component. The spell tattoo vanishes when activated. Enhanced Varisian Tattoo (Su) Isabella gains Varisian Tattoo (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: The Inner Sea World Guide 289) as a bonus feat. Drawing on her tattoos, she can cast geyser as a spell-like ability once per day at caster level 11th. Familiar Tattoo (Su) Isabella gains a sea snake familiar named Moto as an arcane bond. Her familiar can transform itself into a tattoo on her body or back to its normal familiar form as a move action. In tattoo form, her familiar does not count as a separate creature, but it continues to grant its special familiar ability. It has no other abilities and can take no other actions except to transform from a tattoo into a creature.</SpecialAbilities>

    <BeforeCombat>Isabella casts false life, mage armor, protection from arrows, and slipstream on herself before combat, and casts false life and invisibility on her familiar Moto (already included in its stat block on page 36) before transforming it into its tattoo form. She also creates a spell tattoo of vampiric touch on herself.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Isabella casts obscuring mist to hide her longboats' approach to Tidewater Rock, then casts lightning bolts to breach the castle's door. While the pirates press their attack, Isabella casts fly and invisibility and flies to the top of the tower in an attempt to infiltrate it from above, casting summon monster IV to summon a salt mephit to cover her entrance into the tower. Once inside, Isabella calls forth her familiar Moto from its tattoo and designates it to deliver a vampiric touch spell. She then seeks out the leader of the tower forces and attempts to assassinate that character before attacking the tower's defenders from the rear. If attacked in the water, Isabella casts summon monster IV to summon fiendish sharks to attack foes.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Isabella believes in neither giving nor receiving quarter. She refuses to retreat, and if captured alive, she swallows a poison sea urchin spine hidden in a compartment in her false teeth, causing her death 1 round later.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Curse of the Deep (Su) On a successful grapple check, a mummy of the deep presses its lips against an opponent's and regurgitates sea water into the opponent's lungs. Each round thereafter, for the next 10 rounds, the victim must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or be dazed and take 1d4 points of damage that round. Three consecutive successful saves means the victim has coughed up enough water to shake off the effects of the attack and takes no further damage. When a victim reaches 0 or fewer hit points, it falls unconscious. In the next round, it drowns. Holding one's breath does not prevent drowning (water is already in the lungs). A remove curse, heal spell, or DC 20 Heal check halts the damage if applied before the creature reaches 0 or fewer hit points. The save DC is Charisma-based. Despair (Su) All creatures within a 30-foot radius that see a mummy of the deep must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be paralyzed with fear for 1d4 rounds. Whether or not the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected again by that mummy of the deep's despair ability for 24 hours. This is a paralysis and mind-affecting fear attack. The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>

If hard pressed, Krelloort enters a blood frenzy and tries to take down as many opponents as possible.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If Krelloort survives his blood frenzy but finds he still has substantial opponents remaining, he attempts to flee out of the lair through area D18 and down into the depths of the blue hole. He hopes his high Constitution score will allow him to survive in the anoxic waters until his pursuers have succumbed to suffocation. If pursuers instead wait for him above the anoxic level, he eventually swims upward to meet them, fighting to the death to defeat his foes.</Morale>

In addition, they allow him to cast bless once per day. Finally, if Captain Pegsworthy is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, the epaulets automatically cast a sanctuary spell (Will DC 11) on him.

    <SpecialAbilities>Rejuvenation (Su) Whalebone Pilk and his ship Deathknell cannot simply be defeated in combat. If "destroyed," Pilk (and his gear) dissolve into mist. Both captain and ship reappear in 1d3 weeks, fully healed and repaired. The only way to permanently destroy Pilk and the Deathknell is to destroy the ship's bell (hardness 9, hp 30, Break DC 28). Doing so instantly slays Pilk and all his crew, and causes the Deathknell to sink to the bottom of the sea, never to sail again. Steal Air (Su) A breath taker can cause a ghostly, incorporeal hand with a reach of 10 feet to emerge from its own hand. If it makes a successful incorporeal touch attack, the breath taker's hand plunges into the chest of its victim, who must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Constitution damage and become fatigued as he begins to suffocate. On a successful save, the hand is harmlessly expelled. The breath taker must make a touch attack each round as a move action to maintain the connection. As long as the breath taker maintains the connection, the victim must continue to make a Fortitude save each round to expel the hand. On the second failed save, the victim falls unconscious and is reduced to 0 hit points. One round later, the victim falls to &amp;#8211;1 hit points and is dying. One round after that, the victim dies. Each round, the victim can delay that round's effects from occurring by making a successful Fortitude save, but each time a victim fails his Fortitude save, he moves one step further toward suffocation. As this happens, the breath taker's rotted chest visibly expands as it draws the victim's air into itself. To escape the touch, the victim must either make a successful Fortitude save and move (or be carried) out of the breath taker's reach, or the breath taker must be destroyed. The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>

    <DuringCombat>Pilk attempts to skewer an opponent with his harpoon, which is tied off to the mainmast. He then attacks the impaled victim with his steal air attack.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Pilk knows he cannot be permanently killed unless his ship's bell is first destroyed, so he fights recklessly and without fear. If attacks are made against the bell, he panics and focuses all of his attention upon that individual in order to prevent the bell's destruction.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Filament (Ex) A cave fisher can fire a thin filament of sticky silk as a standard action. This touch attack has a range of 60 feet and no range increment. A creature struck by a cave fisher's filament becomes attached to the sticky thread. As a standard action, a creature can rip the filament free with a successful DC 20 Strength check. A caught creature can also attempt to escape a filament by succeeding at a DC 25 Escape Artist check. A filament has AC 18 (touch 10), 20 hit points, and DR 15/slashing. An application of liquid with high alcohol content (or a dose of universal solvent) dissolves the adhesive and releases the creature caught by the filament. A cave fisher can have only one filament active at a time. Pull (Ex) A cave fisher has a +4 racial bonus on combat maneuver checks made using its pull special attack.</SpecialAbilities>
    <DuringCombat>The creature uses its filament to attack the smallest or least-armored target and pull this victim up to its ledge 50 feet above the lower ledge and feast on its meal. It then targets enemies that significantly damage it with a filament attack designed to pull the opponent up over the chasm and then drop it.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If reduced to 30 hit points or fewer, the cave fisher flees.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Cytillesh Symbiosis (Su) The cytillesh fungus infesting the host creature's body acts as the dead flesh's animating force. It grants the creature a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength and Dexterity and a poisonous touch. The slam of a cytillesh zombie releases spores that subject the creature to a mild dose of cytillesh poison. The creature must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or become dazed for 1d3 rounds as it suffers memory loss of the previous moments. Multiple poisoning effects do not stack, but rather only extend the duration. Quick Strikes (Ex) Whenever a cytillesh zombie takes a full-attack action, it can make one additional slam attack at its highest base attack bonus.</SpecialAbilities>
    <DuringCombat>A cytillesh zombie attacks any creature trying to interact with it verbally or physically. Once it targets an opponent, it continues attacking its target until the target or the zombie is dead or destroyed.</DuringCombat>

    <DuringCombat>The derro fires her crossbow at the nearest PC and blows a shrill-sounding whistle, commanding the other cytillipedes to attack the intruders. She continues to make ranged attacks until one of the cytillipedes is killed, at which point she flies into a rage and makes ride-by attacks with her short sword (she makes Ride checks to avoid attacks of opportunity). In later rounds, she urges her mount to close for bite attacks while she attacks with her sword. She attempts to make sneak attacks on any opponents stunned by her mount's cytillesh flashes.</DuringCombat>

    <DuringCombat>Captain Ashferth uses Power Attack on every swing with his longsword. Because of his dulled wits, there is only a 50% chance each round that he will remember to use Spring Attack and Mobility when he would tactically benefit from it.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If Captain Ashferth is brought to half his total hit points, his sense of self-preservation kicks in, allowing him an opposed Charisma check against Gravvik to break the enchantment on him.

    <SpecialAbilities>Fungal Sight (Ex) The long exposure to cytillesh and the chemical admixtures Klangin has been subjected to have destroyed her eyes and replaced them with glowing fungal growths. Her normal vision has been replaced with blindsight and an ability to see the taint of cytillesh or absence of it in other creatures. Both abilities have a range of 60 feet. Vomit (Ex) As a standard action every 1d3 rounds, Klangin may spew noxious fungus-filled vomit from her mouth to a distance of 10 feet at a single target. This is a ranged touch attack that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A creature struck by the vomit must succeed at a DC 17 Fort save or become nauseated for 1d4 rounds. With a successful save, the creature is sickened instead for the same amount of time. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Gender>Female</Gender>
    <DuringCombat>Overwhelmed by the stimulus of battle, Klangin goes into a rage when fighting breaks out and breaks out of her manacles. She attacks the nearest creature that does not have the taint of cytillesh using powerful blow to deal an extra 2 points of damage. She uses Power Attack on all attacks she makes. While raging, she makes bite attacks anytime she can make a full-attack action.</DuringCombat>

    <DuringCombat>These drunken brawlers are just looking for a friendly fight, and fight with unarmed strikes and Power Attack. If any of the PCs pull out weapons or deal lethal damage with their attacks, the brawlers snatch up tankards of ale and smash chairs to use as improvised weapons. The brawlers flank with each other to make sneak attacks, and use combat maneuvers to disarm foes or dirty trick maneuvers to blind opponents for a round or 2 (possibly by throwing ale in their faces) and sneak attack those opponents.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>A drunken brawler attempts to flee if he takes 20 or more points of lethal damage.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>Vakarla casts false life, mage armor, and overland flight every day. When the PCs' ship is about to crash into the reef, she casts mirror image and shield from her wand.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Vakarla casts fog cloud over the PCs' ship, then casts haste on herself and her cutthroats just before her crew board the PCs' ship. She uses her flight to keep out of melee combat and starts by casting fear on a large group of foes, then casts her attack spells against those resisting her crew, using her invisibility field to stay invisible. She saves phantasmal killer for use against the ship's captain. Vakarla's monkey familiar, Mister Swabb, clings to her shoulder flinging droppings and screeching at anyone who attacks her.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Vakarla expects a quick and easy victory, so if her cutthroats are slain, or if she is reduced to fewer than 25 hit points, she flees combat, flying back to her island base (see Development below).</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>Morton casts mage armor daily, and casts shield before confronting the PCs.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Once combat begins, Morton casts tiny hut to provide one-way concealment around the helm of the Dryad's Grave. As his ship closes in, Morton casts solid fog to slow the PCs' ship, followed by confusion, fireball, or stinking cloud on large groups of enemies. When close enough, Morton casts resilient sphere to neutralize enemy spellcasters, then summons groups of fire elementals or a fiendish crocodile aboard the PC's ship. Once the two ships are grappled, Morton uses his dimensional steps ability to board the PCs' ship with his familiar Xicorax.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If reduced to 20 hit points or fewer, or if it's clear that the PCs have the upper hand, Morton calls for parley and begs for mercy. He is loath to lose his ship, but he freely offers the ring of the iron skull in exchange for freedom for himself and the Dryad's Grave. If given no other choice, he fights to the death.</Morale>

    <DuringCombat>Xicorax casts blur and attempts to summon another air mephit. He stays near Morton, using his breath weapon and claws against any attackers. The open air and decks of both the Dryad's Grave and the PCs' ship counts as gusty areas for the purposes of Xicorax's fast healing.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Xicorax flees back to the Dryad's Grave if reduced to fewer than 15 hit points. If Morton is slain, Xicorax flies into the sky, never to return.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>Ormandar casts greater magic fang on himself and his shark companion Galieus every day and uses his totem transformation ability to give himself a shark's bite attack. When he becomes aware of intruders near the wreck, Ormandar casts barkskin and bull's strength on himself and bull's strength on Galieus.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Ormandar orders Galieus and the bull sharks to attack while he stays back and casts dispel magic on air-breathers that are using magic to breathe underwater, forcing those opponents to hold their breath or dash to the surface for air. If Galieus or the two bull sharks are slain, Ormandar wildshapes into a Large great white shark and rushes into melee.</DuringCombat>

    <BeforeCombat>Giles coats two crossbow bolts with deathblade poison, but since he risks poisoning himself if he rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll with a poisoned weapon, he drinks a vial of antitoxin as a precaution beforehand.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Being a consummate professional, Giles makes sure of his kill by firing at least one more crossbow bolt at Corlan, even if the tengu fell in the surprise round. Giles shoots at anyone moving toward his position, and at those who try to help Corlan. If a PC wounds him, he uses his second poisoned bolt on that PC. Giles targets humans, especially those of native Mwangi ethnicity, as a priority. He always uses his Deadly Aim feat (taking a &amp;#8211;3 penalty on attack rolls, but gaining a +6 bonus to damage). If forced into melee combat, Giles spends a move action to affix his sharpshooter's blade to his crossbow, then attacks with the bayonet.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Once he is convinced that Corlan is dead and has ensured that no one can use magic to save the tengu, Giles backs off to the rooftop's far side, climbs down the rope he secured earlier, and disappears into an alleyway. If the PCs prevent his escape, he fights to the death rather than face the ignominy of a murder trial and execution.</Morale>
    <Gear>potions of cure light wounds (2), antitoxin (2), deathblade poison (2 doses)</Gear>

    <BeforeCombat>The Master of Gales casts greater magic fang on his giant squid cohort every day, imbuing all of its natural attacks with a +1 enhancement bonus. He casts endure elements and water breathing on himself every day, and casts air walk, barkskin, extended bear's endurance, extended bull's strength, extended cat's grace, freedom of movement, stoneskin, and true seeing before combat. He also casts animal growth on his giant squid cohort before battle.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>The Master of Gales uses wild shape to assume the form of a giant squid, killer whale, Huge air elemental, or Huge water elemental for combat. He often combines call lightning storm and whirlwind to good effect and reserves his baleful polymorph spell to transform a difficult opponent into a sea slug. In the water, he casts summon monster VII or VIII to summon elder elementals, fiendish giant squids, or fiendish dire sharks to assist him in combat.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If reduced to fewer than 40 hit points, the Master of the Gales uses word of recall stored in his spellstaff to retreat to his sanctuary in Drenchport.</Morale>

    <Morale>As soon as Zadendi realizes that she's been ambushed, she backs out of the alley (and out of the area of the silence) as soon as she can in order to use her magic. She continues her fighting retreat until brought below 20 hit points, at which point she puts all of her energy into escaping. Clever PCs can let her "escape," and if they do, they can trail her all the way to the shrine if the Scarlet Son has fled already (thus forcing Zadendi to flee on foot).</Morale>

    <DuringCombat>The Scarlet Son watches from his vantage point atop a nearby roof, using his freeze ability to stay hidden. As soon as he realizes Zadendi is being ambushed, he swoops down and tries once to grab the cleric and fly away with her, relying on his damage reduction to prevent him from taking much damage from attacks of opportunity.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>The Scarlet Son abandons Zadendi as soon as she is killed, or as soon as the gargoyle is reduced below 25 hit points, fleeing back to the Old Shrine.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>As soon as she hears the PCs approaching (either due to a fight against the wights or the triggering of the glyph of warding in area 2), Avalexi assumes the form of "Lex Avai," teleports into the cell, and prepares to trick the PCs as detailed above.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Avalexi's first act in combat after her death attack attempt is to retreat to her cell to retrieve her bow and arrows. She then teleports into the catacombs (area 2), attempts to summon a babau demon to send back to attack the PCs, then attempts to use her wand via Use Magic Device to arm herself with a flame blade before assuming her true form and teleporting back into area 3 to continue the fight 3 rounds after she first teleported away. In her natural form, the redheaded succubus looks uncannily like a demonic version of the goddess Sarenrae&amp;#8211;especially with her flaming scimitar. Avalexi blasphemously acts the part, claiming to be the true scion of the Dawnflower and accusing any obvious worshipers of Sarenrae of being heretics. She uses dominate person and charm monster on any foes that seem to be particularly good at harming her, using vampiric touch on heavily armored foes to hurt them and heal herself whenever she's brought below 40 hit points.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Avalexi has put too much work into corrupting the shrine to want to abandon it, and as such she fights almost to the death. If reduced to fewer than 10 hit points, she teleports elsewhere to recover and, for the time, abandons her plans for the shrine. In this event, the PCs have still effectively disrupted her short-term plans, but Avalexi might become a recurring villain if you continue beyond this adventure.</Morale>

    <DuringCombat>The octopus targets multiple victims with its tentacles, relying on Blind-Fight and its grab ability to pull opponents into the water. Once it has prey in the water, the octopus either constricts it, transfers the victim to its mouth for a poisonous bite, or holds it underwater until it drowns.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>The octopus retreats if it falls below 25 hit points, leaving behind an ink cloud as it jets away with any victims still in its grasp.</Morale>

If an opponent makes a successful DC 23 Will save while interacting with a shade, the pirate shades' damage is 80% normal, special abilities that do not deal lethal damage are only 80% likely to work, and their AC bonuses are 80% normal. Likewise, the shades' equipment is not real, and disappears when the shades vanish at sunrise or when slain.</SpecialAbilities>

She then grabs a physically weaker opponent and drags the victim up the tower wall to use as a bargaining chip to force the others to do her bidding.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Paeta has no wish to die in Haetanga's service. If reduced to 30 hit points or fewer, she flees to the Ethereal Plane and reports to her mistress, who likely comes to investigate the PCs herself soon afterward.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Paranoid (Ex) Ederleigh suffers from paranoia (Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide 251), giving him a &amp;#8211;4 penalty on Will saves and Charisma-based skill checks (included in his stat block). He cannot receive benefit from or attempt the aid another action and cannot willingly accept aid (including healing) from another creature unless he makes a successful DC 17 Will save. Schizophrenic (Ex) Ederleigh also suffers from schizophrenia (GameMastery Guide 251), giving him an additional &amp;#8211;4 penalty on all Wisdom and Charisma-based skill checks (included in his stat block). He cannot take 10 or take 20 on skill checks, and each time he finds himself in a stressful situation (such as combat), he must make a successful DC 16 Will save or become confused for 1d6 rounds.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Gender>Male</Gender>
    <BeforeCombat>Because of his paranoia, Ederleigh sees enemies everywhere. He drinks his potion of cat's grace at the first sign of trouble and casts levitate to get out of harm's way.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Ederleigh relies on his spells and hand of the apprentice to fight from range, using his cunning trigger rogue talent to trigger traps in the room as swift actions (see Traps, below). His paranoia makes him unwilling to use his familiar, Dolo, to deliver touch spells. If cornered, Ederleigh wields his short sword to the best of his ability.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If reduced to fewer than 40 hit points, Ederleigh leaps out the window, using feather fall to safely reach the ground. He then drinks his potion of invisibility and uses his scroll of expeditious retreat to run to the armory (area B26) which he locks himself in and uses as a safe room. Ederleigh surrenders only if subdued or brought to 12 hit points or fewer.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Rejuvenation (Su) If slain, Bikendi's ghost reforms 2d4 days later.

    <ProhibitedSchools>evocation, transmutation</ProhibitedSchools>
    <BeforeCombat>Bikendi casts mage armor every day and shield when intruders enter the cellar.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Bikendi casts dust of twilight to darken the surroundings and fatigue foes. He uses his malevolence ability to possess an identifiable cleric and ensure that character can't channel positive energy against him, while casting his spells using that enemy's body. If this tactic fails, or if he's forced to abandon a living body, Bikendi debilitates the same opponent with a blinding ray, deep slumber, or phantasmal killer. Against other opponents, he relies on his invisibility field to hide while casting illusions, enervation, feeblemind, shadow conjuration, shadow evocation, or his ray spells to weaken them. Thereafter, Bikendi attacks with his corrupting touch, in combination with touch spells such as bestow curse, touch of idiocy, or vampiric touch.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Obsessed with completing his ritual, Bikendi rejuvenates if slain. He then uses more nightmares to threaten the PCs, hoping to convince or bribe them into retrieving the immortal dreamstone, if for no reason other than to end his nightly visitations.</Morale>

    <DuringCombat>Shaija coordinates with her fellow cyclopes, encouraging them to use their flash of insight abilities to swiftly take down battle-hardened opponents with critical hits and Power Attacks&amp;#8211;or, in her case, with a single Vital Strike. If she's able to easily hit foes, Shaija attacks with both her axe and spiked shield, but she switches to Power Attacks with just her axe if she needs to inflict more damage.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Once Shaija falls below 40 hit points, or when only two of her cyclops partners remain, Shaija orders one of them to warn Ishtoreth in area G17, intent on buying the great cyclops time to prepare. She then relies on her ferocity to keep fighting her foes to the death.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>Fargo casts false life every morning. Once the PCs engage the Jester's Grin, he shifts into his hybrid form and casts cat's grace, jump, see invisibility, shield, and spider climb on himself.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Fargo casts greater invisibility and climbs into the ship's rigging. From there, he creates a major image of himself on the fore deck (area R1) to make it seem that he teleported to the far side of the ship. Fargo uses the illusion to draw out conversations with his enemies; the illusion acts in a conciliatory fashion while he himself uses tricky spells to secretly target them with charm monster or suggestion. He follows those spells with message so he can whisper directions to anyone affected by his enchantments. Fargo targets anyone who sees through his ruse with debilitating spells such as confusion or hideous laughter so they can't inform the others. He then slips back into the fray, executing sneak attacks or casting hold person on enemy spellcasters. Against especially dangerous foes, he keeps his distance while firing his wand of lightning bolts.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If reduced to 20 hit points or fewer, Fargo casts blink and withdraws. Diving overboard, he transforms into a dire rat and clings to the ship's hull while holding his breath. If he eludes pursuit, Fargo abandons his crew (and his ship, if the PCs commandeer it) and makes for shore at nightfall.</Morale>

    <DuringCombat>Highly skilled in swordplay, Cerise uses Combat Expertise, her offensive defense rogue talent, and her defending rapier to increase her Armor Class and keep attackers at bay. She moves strategically through any melee, tumbling past opponents and through occupied squares with her superior Acrobatics skill in order to avoid becoming surrounded. When possible, she feints to create sneak attack opportunities for herself, always attempting to knock away an enemy's weapon by utilizing her Disarming Strike feat when she scores a critical hit.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Cerise appreciates anyone who bests her in physical combat, becoming intrigued enough to surrender. After falling below 20 hit points&amp;#8211;and provided her attackers have acted honorably&amp;#8211;she relinquishes her blade, counting on escaping later or waiting until her loyal crew rescues her. If she senses duplicity and evil intentions in her opponents, however, she evades capture at all costs.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>The Eel drinks extracts of darkvision, false life, and resurgent transformation every day. Before planting his bombs on the pirate lords' ships (see Event 8), he drinks his greater mutagen, followed by extracts of fluid form, cat's grace, expeditious retreat, freedom of movement, protection from energy (fire), see invisibility, shield, and spider climb.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>The Eel drinks an extract of greater invisibility on the first round of combat, using spider climb and his ring of jumping to leap and scamper from one wall to another as he fights. While invisible, he hurls explosive or dispelling bombs at his opponents, enhancing his throws with bomber's eye or true strike, if given time. If his invisibility expires or proves ineffective, the Eel drinks extracts of displacement and nondetection to further hide his position. If cornered, he activates his armor's elemental aura and drinks an extract of elemental touch (acid) to better defend himself. If still surrounded when his armor's aura expires, the Eel drinks an extract of detonate.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If the Eel is reduced to fewer than 39 hit points, his resurgent transformation activates, and he drinks an extract or potion of cure serious wounds to further restore himself. If his resurgent transformation expires, or he is reduced to fewer than 25 hit points, the Eel drinks an extract of fly and attempts to flee elsewhere on the island until he can escape. If unable to flee, the Eel fights to the bitter end.</Morale>

    <Gender>Male</Gender>
    <BeforeCombat>Mase casts barkskin, bull's strength, and protection from energy (fire) on himself ahead of any battle. If he anticipates fighting in the water or close quarters combat, he casts freedom of movement as well.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Initially, Mase prefers to use air walk or wild shape into a Medium air elemental to rise above the battlefield. From that vantage point, he pelts anyone under him with ball lightning, call lightning, sleet storm, or his lightning lord domain ability, utilizing his Natural Spell feat if necessary. He casts warp wood to render the ranged weapons of attackers useless. After softening up his opposition with these tactics, Mase returns to the ground, targeting humans whenever possible with his scimitar.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If reduced to 25 hit points or fewer, Mase attempts to withdraw, screening himself with fog cloud or obscuring mist so he can wild shape into an elemental and move away at maximum speed.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Bardic Performance&amp;#8211;Devastating Aria (Su) By spending 1 round of bardic performance as a standard action, Isawyn can direct a burst of sound at a target within 30 feet. This deals 1d4+10 points of sonic damage to an object, or half this amount to a living creature. Bardic Performance&amp;#8211;Scathing Tirade (Su) To affect a creature with a scathing tirade, Isawyn must be within 30 feet of the target, who must be able to see and hear her. The targeted creature becomes frightened (Will DC 19 reduces the effect to the shaken condition) for as long as Isawyn continues the performance plus 1d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. Costume Proficiency (Ex) Isawyn is proficient with medium armor and can cast bard spells while wearing medium armor without incurring arcane spell failure chance. Famous (Ex) Isawyn gains a +3 bonus on Bluff and Intimidate checks made in and around certain parts of central Cheliax&amp;#8211;this ability is of little use to her at this time. Prima Donna (Ex) Isawyn can expend an extra round of bardic performance to gain a +2 bonus on Perform checks or save DCs to her countersong, fascinate, and scathing tirade bardic performances.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Gender>Female</Gender>
    <BeforeCombat>Isawyn casts unseen servant at the start of every day. She drinks a potion of bear's endurance just before combat.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Isawyn activates her bardic performance to inspire courage, then casts invisibility and uses haste and healing magic to aid Gorebeard and any summoned monsters. She uses her unseen servant to open and close doors, pick up fallen weapons, and otherwise do small tasks during combat to keep opponents on their toes and force them to waste time with move actions to counter these minor inconveniences. She targets the most heavily armored foe with dominate person and orders that person to strip out of his armor, drop his weapons, and then stand patiently in the corner of the room. If the battle turns bad, she risks ordering the dominated person to attack her enemies with his bare hands. If a foe looks like he's only a few points away from being knocked unconscious, Isawyn uses devastating aria to try to knock him out with the damage it causes.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Isawyn doesn't want to die here; she casts dimension door to escape into the surrounding slums if reduced to fewer than 15 hit points. Isawyn holds grudges, however, and having heard of the PCs' infamous grudge against Harrigan, she seeks him out and joins him in defending his island if she can escape.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Create Spawn (Su) A humanoid or monstrous humanoid killed by a brykolakas rises as a lacedon in 1d4 days under the control of the brykolakas that created it. Death Throes (Su) When reduced to 0 or fewer hit points, a brykolakas is destroyed and its body changes into a pool of deadly poison that quickly fills a 10-foot-radius spread (if underwater) or a 10-foot-diameter puddle (if on land) in 1 round. All creatures in this area are exposed to this foul venom. The poison disperses in 1 round if underwater, or 1d2 rounds if on land. Brykolakas poison: Death throes&amp;#8211;contact; save Fort DC 20; onset 1 minute; frequency 1/round for 2 rounds; effect 1d6 Dex damage; cure 1 save. The save DC is Charisma-based. Disease (Su) A brykolakas's claw attacks deliver a virulent disease that breaks down the victim's internal organs, resulting in internal bleeding and a gradual darkening of the skin. This supernatural disease is called brykolakas fever. The save DC is Charisma-based. Brykolakas fever: Claw&amp;#8211;injury; save Fortitude DC 20 negates; onset 1 minute; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Con and 1d4 Dex damage; cure 1 save. Water Dependency (Ex) A brykolakas can survive out of the water for 6 hours. After that, its body begins drying out, and within 1 hour, the brykolakas crumbles into dust (this does not activate its death throes ability) unless it can reach saltwater before the hour passes.</SpecialAbilities>
    <DuringCombat>The brykolakases let their lacedon minions engage opponents first, using them as sacrificial troops to distract enemies and perhaps use up some resources before they step in to focus their attacks on the same foes.</DuringCombat>

    <DuringCombat>Alise makes good use of Spring Attack in combat, staying on the move so she can make flanking attacks while minimizing full attacks on herself from enemies. She avoids ending her turn standing within 5 feet of any foe.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Alise surrenders if either she's brought below 25 hit points or at least four of the other castaways are defeated. In this event, Alise throws herself upon the PCs' mercy, tearfully explaining that she feared they were assassins sent by Harrigan and begging them to rescue her and her crew from this "cursed rock." If she finds out that the PCs are Harrigan's enemies, she tells them about the files her captain Scags kept on his old commander, stored in a watertight chest on the Devilish Duchess, which she knows has been claimed by the brykolakases and is in area A5. See "Rescue and Repairs" on page 25 for more details on how Alise can help the PCs against Harrigan.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Pirate Tricks (Ex) Barracuda gains a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls with a cutlass, rapier, or short sword. He can hold his breath for 36 rounds before risking drowning. He does not lose his Dex bonus to AC when climbing. If he damages a foe with sneak attack, he can try to trip that foe as an immediate action. He gains a +2 bonus on Climb checks when using ropes, and when he does so, climbs twice as quickly as normal.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Gender>Male</Gender>
    <DuringCombat>Barracuda uses his officers to set up flanking opportunities, barking orders to move them around the combat as needed. He uses his swinging reposition ability to try to bull rush players over the side of the ship, then moves closer to allies so he can make full attacks as soon as possible. He uses Combat Expertise if faced by particularly hard-hitting foes.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If reduced to fewer than 15 hit points, Barracuda drops his weapons and surrenders, hoping to appeal to the PCs' sense of pity at this point to claim his birthright.</Morale>

    <DuringCombat>Even though their regeneration doesn't work out of water, the scrags are ruthless and aggressive in battle. The scrags do more damage with their axes, but if a scrag consistently misses foes, it throws the axes aside in disgust to switch to biting and clawing.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Although the scrags are charmed, this doesn't make them foolhardy. A scrag panics if brought below 25 hit points, and immediately attempts to flee the castle and into the ocean to activate its regeneration ability. If a scrag is released from a charm monster effect, it immediately realizes it's been tricked and flees into the ocean at once, abandoning its duties.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>Luccaria casts greater magic weapon on her swords and magic vestment on her armor. As soon as she hears her cultists in area D9 shouting, she casts air walk, bear's endurance, and invisibility on herself. She also casts spell immunity, choosing spells she knows the PCs favor.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Once combat starts in area D9, and once she is invisible, Luccaria sends her two attendant cultists into area D9 as well to join the fight. She follows, casting quickened shield of faith and heroism as she enters the room. If the opportunity presents itself, she casts blade barrier to block escape routes. Once she's visible, Luccaria casts her ranged attack spells. If she's engaged in melee she casts quickened divine might before attacking, then channels negative energy as a swift action the following round to activate her grayflame short sword (which increases the weapon's enhancement bonus by +1 and deals +1d6 points of damage for 6 rounds). Luccaria casts heal on herself if she ever drops below 40 hit points.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If dropped below 15 hit points, Luccaria casts mislead and attempts to escape to Harrigan's side (in area G3) to inform him of the PCs and to aid him in combat. She does not abandon Harrigan as long as he lives, but if he is slain, she attempts to flee the Shackles entirely.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>Jakaw casts barkskin, bear's endurance, greater magic fang, and longstrider if the alarm is raised.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Jakaw uses his hunter's bond to grant bonuses to the smugglers in the area on the first round of combat, while declaring the toughest-looking human enemy as his quarry. If the alarm is raised, Jakaw can establish one of the PCs as his quarry early by watching them from afar if he gets the chance. Jakaw leaps into battle with a cackle once he's established quarry and granted his companions his hunter's bond, focusing his attacks on his quarry before moving on to other humans or elves if possible.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If reduced to fewer than 40 hit points, Jakaw attempts to retreat to Harrigan's side (area G3) to report his failure and then help protect his captain. He fights to the death otherwise.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>Gilbrok casts overland flight on himself every day.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Once Gilbrok finishes his weather control hex, or once he's confronted in combat, he uses a dose of dust of disappearance at once&amp;#8211;he knows he's close to helpless in direct melee combat, and relies upon the greater invisibility afforded by the dust to survive, using flight to stay mobile and change position each round while he harries foes with his ranged attacks. Each time his dust wears out, he uses a new dose to maintain invisibility.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If reduced to fewer than 30 hit points or if his invisibility tactics aren't working (or if he runs out of dust of disappearance), Gilbrok flees to Harrigan's side in area G3 to cower behind him for protection. He won't surrender or flee at this point, but if Harrigan is slain, he immediately surrenders and begs the PCs for mercy, promising to serve them well if they spare his miserable life.</Morale>

    <DuringCombat>Adelita hangs back at first, letting her crew move forward while she supports them with spells. She casts quickened shield on the first round, along with invisibility so she can prepare a few other spells (mirror image and heroism) before she joins in with her attack spells. She casts repulsion if too many enemies are reaching her.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Adelita fights until reduced to 40 hit points or fewer, at which point she attempts to teleport back to Harrigan's fortress to warn him of the fleet's failure. If she escapes in this manner, feel free to either have her join forces with Harrigan (if your PCs could use a bigger challenge) or join the other prisoners in the prison (area D5) after some unfortunate mutilations to her hands and tongue.</Morale>

    <DuringCombat>The goblin commando makes sure to use his Mounted Combat feat as often as possible to try to negate an attack each round against his mount, and uses his superior mobility to remain out of melee so he can shoot at the PCs with his bow from dogback (taking the standard &amp;#8211;4 penalty for using a ranged weapon while mounted). If all of his goblin warriors are defeated, he drops his bow and races in to fight the PCs in melee.</DuringCombat>

    <DuringCombat>Ven always uses Power Attack when pummeling foes. Although he's enraged to find his beloved daughter in the arms of a "thug," he won't continue beating on a foe once his target is unconscious&amp;#8211;but neither will Ven attempt to stanch a beaten foe's bleeding.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Ven is enraged, but if reduced below 5 hit points, he drops to his knees and begs for mercy. Of course, if granted mercy, Ven's anger remains, and he'll nurse a grudge against the PC once he's had a chance to recover and foster fresh anger</Morale>

    <DuringCombat>Tsuto's main advantage in battle is his mobility. He uses Acrobatics to move around the battlefield and flanks foes with his goblins as he can. When facing spellcasters, he uses stunning fist to keep them occupied.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If brought below 8 hit points, or if all of his goblins are slain, Tsuto runs for his life down the smuggler's tunnel, abandoning all thought of returning to Nualia with his sister in tow and fleeing back to Thistletop.</Morale>

    <DuringCombat>Although tough to hit and capable of healing from wounds quickly, Erylium remains something of a coward in a fight. She uses flight to maintain ranged superiority over foes, using spells like summon monster or hold person (aimed at the best-armored of her foes) in the first few rounds of combat. She uses her Tiny +1 cold iron returning dagger against foes once she runs out of spells, but if cornered, she fights with her claws and bite.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If reduced to 5 hit points or fewer, Erylium becomes invisible and flees, waiting for her fast healing to fix her up before returning here to attack the PCs again.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>Gogmurt uses speak with animals and casts flame blade, then uses his wand of produce flame before investigating the PCs' arrival. If he thinks there's time, he also casts animal messenger to send a thrush out to the island to deliver a bloodstained goblin tooth to Warchief Ripnugget&amp;#8211;a prearranged code to warn that the adventurers have finally arrived to murder them all. Gogmurt calls Tangletooth to his side and directs her in combat using speak with animals.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Gogmurt casts entangle on the first round of combat, taking care to place the spell so that it blocks access to area C9 but doesn't block his own possible escape routes. If the PCs have animal minions, he casts charm animal on one of them. On following rounds, he fights with his flame blade in one hand, throwing fire from produce flame in the other when he needs to make ranged attacks. As soon as he's brought below 20 hit points, he retreats by fleeing into the brambles, heals himself as best he can, and then returns to ambush the PCs from behind by swapping out a remaining 1st-level spell for summon nature's ally I.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If he is ever brought below 10 hit points and has no healing left, Gogmurt attempts to flee north to warn Warchief Ripnugget about the PCs. If surrounded or captured, Gogmurt's resolve breaks and he sobs for mercy.</Morale>

    <DuringCombat>Bruthazmus reacts to intrusions on his personal time with roars and curses. There's a 50% chance he's not wearing his armor if encountered in area D2; in any event, he flies into combat with his heavy flail with a murderous glee. He attacks elves in preference to any other target.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If brought below 15 hit points, Bruthazmus attempts to flee to area D15, where he barricades the door and then races downstairs to area E4 to join Nualia, hoping to get some healing and then remaining at her side as a bodyguard until the PCs are no longer a threat.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>Before combat starts, Lyrie casts mage armor.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Lyrie knows she's outclassed in most fights, and prefers to avoid combat when alone if possible. If forced into combat, she first casts mirror image, then focuses most of her spells on heavily armored characters, casting shatter on a weapon and ray of enfeeblement in an attempt to get them to suffer for wearing such heavy armor. She relies heavily on her wand of magic missile in combat.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Lyrie is a coward at heart, and as soon as she's hit for damage, she attempts to flee to the closest ally for help. If she believes the PCs have harmed Tsuto, though, her anger takes over and she fights to the death in an attempt to avenge him.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Subdomains Nualia's subdomains (introduced in the Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide) grant her unusual abilities. Fury of the Abyss allows her to gain a +2 bonus on melee attacks, melee damage rolls, and combat maneuver checks for 1 round as a swift action, during which round she takes a &amp;#8211;2 penalty to her AC. Ferocious strike allows her to gain a +2 bonus on damage rolls with a melee attack up to six times per day.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Gender>Female</Gender>
    <BeforeCombat>If Nualia suspects combat is imminent, she casts bull's strength, cat's grace, and shield of faith on herself.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Nualia activates her Sihedron medallion as a free action at the start of combat to gain false life and casts divine favor She prefers to fight with her bastard sword, her face an impassive mask save for her eyes, which blaze with anger. She uses fury of the Abyss on each of the first 6 rounds of combat (these bonuses are included in the stats above), and activates her ferocious strike on the first six successful hits. She saves shatter to use on any weapon that seems to be particularly dangerous in an enemy's hands. If possible, she moves into the hall to the south so that it's harder to surround her, and so she has an escape route handy, using channeled negative energy to clear a path if needed.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Nualia is loath to abandon her hard work, but if reduced to fewer than 15 hit points, she does just that, reasoning that escape and eventual revenge is better than death at the hands of the PCs. She uses obscuring mist and/or sanctuary to aid her escape, then does her best to flee Thistletop, ordering any surviving minions she encounters to guard her retreat. If she escapes, she makes her way to Magnimar to reunite with the Skinsaw Cult&amp;#8211;see page 67 for more details.</Morale>

    <DuringCombat>If Erin panics, he tries to flee to area A3 or area A10, whichever is farther from the PCs, and barricades himself in the room. If he has a chance, he'll open the doors to areas A11 and A13, or pound on the door leading downstairs from area A4 to bring more dangerous foes than him into the fight.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If brought below 10 hit points or cornered, Erin drops to his knees and begs for mercy. He blames his sinister experimentation on Caizarlu, saying the necromancer forced him to take part in several experiments and warning the PCs that Caizarlu dwells downstairs. If the PCs seek Caizarlu out, Erin takes the first chance he can to flee&amp;#8211;if he escapes, he heads south to Magnimar, hoping to lose himself in the big city and, someday, repair and rebuild his reputation.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>Ironbriar prepares for combat by casting bear's endurance, cat's grace, shield of faith, and invisibility.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Ironbriar prefers to let his cultists fight in melee, himself hanging back to use his spells and channel energy at range. Once he's cast his ranged spells, he moves in to flank foes with his magic sword. If fighting on his own, he tries to time things so that he casts summon monster III to bring in additional allies with which to flank foes&amp;#8211;he prefers to summon 1d3 lemures with this spell so as to gain more allies with which to flank than a single tougher ally. Ironbriar also prefers to fight in larger areas where he can take advantage of movement, and as such attempts to escape into area D6 to fight as soon as he can.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>As long as he remains under the effect of Xanesha's charm monster spell, Ironbriar fights to the death. If the charm effect ends, he suddenly realizes how the lamia matriarch has been using him and immediately offers the PCs a deal, as detailed under Development. If the PCs refuse to deal with Ironbriar, he does his best to escape into the city&amp;#8211;he abandons his life here and attempts to flee back to the city of Vyre to start a new life.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>If she realizes the PCs are near (as is the case if the faceless stalkers drop a bell), Xanesha casts invisibility and mirror image on herself. She also activates her Sihedron medallion's false life ability.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Xanesha uses major image to make an illusory flying demon appear in a cloud of smoke that then begins to circle the top of the tower. She then moves to make a sneak attack on the nearest PC. After this attack, she prefers to fight in melee, saving her medusa mask to temporarily petrify any particularly dangerous foe. If she is reduced to fewer than 60 hit points, she casts cure serious wounds on herself.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If she's reduced to 20 hit points or fewer, Xanesha attempts to flee Magnimar, abandoning her plot and the scroll hidden in her nest. Simply slithering off the side of the tower and using feather fall to descend to the ground below is her easiest method of escape. If she escapes, she cuts ties with her kin and Mokmurian, afraid of the punishment for failure. She grows obsessed with the PCs, however, seeing their capture as the only way she can redeem herself to Mokmurian&amp;#8211;in this case, she becomes a recurring villain who might ally with any number of foes the PCs find themselves up against in the next adventure&amp;#8211;although she specifically tries to avoid any situation that would reveal her failure to her sister Lucrecia.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Ogrekin Deformities (Ex) Mammy Graul's thick layers of blubber increase her natural armor bonus by an additional 3 points, but her obesity also reduces her speed to 5 feet and imparts a &amp;#8211;4 penalty to her Dexterity.</SpecialAbilities>

    <BeforeCombat>As soon as she hears trouble outside, Mammy Graul casts mage armor and false life on herself. If she realizes someone's about to enter her room, she casts mirror image and fly as well.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>If the PCs confront Mammy Graul here, she's more enraged at her boys for allowing the PCs to get this far than she is at the PCs themselves, and her profanity-laced shrieks against her boys fill any surviving Grauls with such fear that none of them dare come to their mother's aid. Mammy Graul sends her three zombies to engage the PCs while she remains on her bed in the northwest corner of the room and casts spells. She starts with spectral hand and follows up with her offensive spells.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If reduced to 20 hit points or fewer, she casts dimension door and retreats to area A16 to secure the aid of any surviving Grauls there. She leads them back to the farmhouse to attack the PCs, this time fighting to the death.</Morale>

    <DuringCombat>Jakardros's strength lies in his archery. He trusts (and depends) on his allies and his animal companion Kibb to hold off foes in melee while he provides ranged support. Yet when his allies are in desperate need, he won't hesitate to lay down his bow and join them in melee.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Jakardros has little concern for his own safety, and is actively looking for a foe that can finish him off. He fights to the death as a result. Once he's reconciled with Shalelu, though, his outlook shifts dramatically; he devotes his life to protecting the elven ranger, doting on her as if she were his own daughter. He'll fight to the death to protect her, but otherwise breaks off combat and retreats if brought below 20 hit points so he can stay alive to defend Shalelu in the future.</Morale>

    <DuringCombat>Although Vale pays little attention to how much damage he takes during a fight, he certainly doesn't fight recklessly. He approaches battle with a wide-eyed excitement, viewing each fight as a puzzle to be solved with mind and steel. He has a knack for seeking out subtle tactical advantages (higher ground, flanking, cover, and the like) that serve him well. Vale prefers to fight with a battleaxe and handaxe, and once an enemy is engaged, he makes Power Attacks unless he can't quite hit foes with his secondary attacks. He views his greatest flaw as his lack of talent in finesse fighting, and when he grows too overconfident, he often makes trip, disarm, and flanking attacks that provoke a dangerous number of attacks of opportunity.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If Vale is left on his own, the concept of retreat would never occur to him. He becomes so enthralled with the battle that he loses track of his own well-being.</Morale>

    <DuringCombat>Kaven is most comfortable wielding small and fast weapons like daggers, short swords, or rapiers. In battle, he seeks out wounded foes, leaving stronger enemies for his "allies" to handle.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Kaven is a coward at heart, but his worries&amp;#8211;that abandoning his "allies" too soon would reveal the depths of his treachery&amp;#8211;keep him in a fight longer than he might otherwise remain. If brought below 10 hit points, he feigns death with a Bluff check, hoping to seize a chance to escape once attentions are focused elsewhere. If this tactic fails, he gives in to his fear and makes a run for it. Kaven has already betrayed his allies once, and if he thinks betraying the PCs might aid in his own survival, he won't hesitate for a moment to do so again. If the opportunity presents itself, he's not above taking a hostage&amp;#8211;although he'd prefer to take someone smaller and weaker than himself if possible, like a wizard or a gnome or a halfling.</Morale>

    <DuringCombat>Jaagrath is perhaps a bit overconfident in his fighting prowess, but that certainly doesn't mean he's a pushover. He rages on the first round of combat, then focuses his attacks on humans, saving other races for "clean up."</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If Jaagrath is brought below 25 hit points, he attempts to flee to area B30 to recruit aid, drinking both of his potions as soon as he gets a chance. Once at area B30, Jaagrath fights to the death.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Magic Tattoo Lucrecia used her Inscribe Magical Tattoo feat to give herself a lesser caster's tattoo. This magical tattoo looks like a Sihedron rune&amp;#8211;tattooed on her left breast, it grants her the ability to enhance a 3rd-level or lower spell she casts with Still Spell and Silent Spell. She can do this once per day as a swift action. This feat and magical tattoo are detailed in full on page 16 of Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Magic.</SpecialAbilities>

    <DuringCombat>Grazuul attempts to remain in the water throughout the entire combat so he can continue enjoying the effects of his regeneration, but once he's brought below 50 hit points, he drops his trident and switches over to using his claws to let his regeneration catch up with all the damage he'd been doing to himself by using the vicious weapon. If facing characters wearing heavy armor, he clambers out of his pool to try to bull rush them into the water if the opportunity presents itself.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Grazuul fights to the death, confident that his regeneration will save him if he's defeated. If, on the other hand, the PCs use fire or acid against him, he abandons Skull's Crossing once brought below 20 hit points and flees into area C14 and thence north into the Storval Deep.</Morale>

    <DuringCombat>Although Myriana is undead, she was made so by despair, not hate. She would rather recruit the PCs than harm them. She prefers to use her stunning glance to defeat foes without causing lasting harm, but if pressed uses her magic and corrupting gaze to get her point across.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>As long as her lover remains atop Hook Mountain as an undead monster, Myriana cannot be slain forever. She fights until destroyed, then rejuvenates with the next sunset and sends Yap to gather the PCs to her side once again&amp;#8211;if she's ignored, she may turn her wrath against Turtleback Ferry.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>If Barl hears the sounds of combat nearby, he stations his stone giant bodyguard near the entrance. Once that guard notices the PCs approaching, he calls out to Barl, who casts fly and spectral hand if he has the chance.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Barl activates his Sihedron medallion's false life on the first round of combat. He would rather let his bodyguard fight his fights while he remains seated on his throne, casting spells from there. If the PCs manage to reach him in melee, he sighs heavily, lifts his earth breaker, and responds in kind. If one of the PCs is killed, Barl gets a gleam in his eye and casts animate dead on the body the first chance he gets, more to see the anguish of the new zombie's onetime allies than out of any real sense of tactics.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Barl is no stranger to death, but does not want to die himself. If reduced to fewer than 15 hit points, the giant drops his weapon and begs for his life. He's willing to reveal much of what Mokmurian has planned for the region if the PCs are willing to grant him mercy (see Concluding the Adventure, below).</Morale>

    <DuringCombat>Teraktinus wastes no time in carrying out his own mission. He and his two bodyguards make their way through Sandpoint toward the Old Light&amp;#8211;if no one stands in their way, they reach the ruins on Round 20. Teraktinus spends 5 rounds digging through the ruins for a good-sized stone for Mokmurian, then sounds the call for retreat with his war horn. If anyone gets in his way, he proves quite creative at finding things to throw at his enemies&amp;#8211;chimneys, pieces of buildings, and wagons work as well as thrown rocks in a pinch. In any event, foes brave enough to stand in his way annoy him to such a degree that he abandons his mission long enough to try to kill them. If faced with particularly powerful foes, he uses his war horn to summon aid (Longtooth if the dragon's still available; or the closest group of giants otherwise).</DuringCombat>

    <SpecialAbilities>Breath of Death (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, the Black Monk can exhale a 30-foot cone of tomb gas. Living creatures in this area must make a successful DC 22 Fortitude save or gain 1d4 negative levels. A creature killed by these negative levels rises as a juju zombie (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 291) in 1d4 rounds. A juju zombie created in this manner is under the Black Monk's control and remains so until it or the Black Monk is destroyed. The save DC is Charisma-based. Despair (Su) This functions as a typical mummy's despair, save that once a paralyzed creature recovers from the effect, it remains staggered for 1 additional round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. Mummy Rot (Su) This functions as the typical mummy rot curse and disease, save that the Black Monk can afflict foes with it via his flurry of blows.</SpecialAbilities>

    <DuringCombat>The Black Monk uses Improved Trip and Stunning Fist against foes in melee to keep them off balance.

    <DuringCombat>Conna's main tactic is to stall. She uses Combat Expertise to increase her AC when she can. If she has time to prepare, she casts fly on herself.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Conna doesn't want to fight the PCs. Her tactics focus on escape so she can recover in hiding and plan a new method of contacting the PCs and once again try to plead her case and recruit them in her plans against Mokmurian.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>Galenmir drinks his potion of heroism and uses oil of darkness on his pick (unless the PCs don't seem to be relying on light, in which case he does not use this tactic).</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Galenmir has stacked several rocks next to the pit entrance to his lair and uses these against intruders. If confronted in close quarters, he uses Improved Bull Rush to keep his enemies from surrounding him and to set himself up for tactical advantages. He always uses Power Attack (these bonuses are included in his stats above).</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Although Galenmir is no coward, he realizes when he's been beaten. If reduced to 30 hit points or fewer, he drinks his potion of gaseous form and seeps into the cracks and crevices of the caves, working his way up and out of the pit to gather a group of eight stone giants to then lead back into the pit to seek out the PCs. While he's aware that Mokmurian will likely be furious at this breach of edict, Galenmir assumes his lord will be even more furious if the PCs are allowed to explore the caves uncontested.</Morale>

    <DuringCombat>Enga is brave and fearless, despite (or perhaps due to) her small stature. She rages on the first round of combat and focuses her anger on healers first and foremost.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Enga flees to the southwest if reduced to fewer than 20 hit points, hoping to lose her tormenters in the mazelike region. If she's got a few rounds, she rigs a quick but deadly trap by removing her necklace of fireballs (but keeping one bead) and leaving it on the ground. She then moves about 60 feet away and waits; once she sees someone reach the necklace, she throws her bead and detonates the entire necklace at once. She then doubles back to area B7a via a different route and seeks out one of the lamias in area B13 for aid.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Earth-Shaking Bellow (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds, Lokansir can loose an earth-shaking bellow that functions like an earthquake spell, affecting a 40-foot-cone. Meld Into Earth (Su) At will, Lokansir can meld into earth (not solid stone) as if using the meld into stone spell, except that he may remain in the earth as long as he wishes. A move earth spell cast upon his location causes him to be expelled from the earth and take 5d6 points of damage. While melded with earth, he gains fast healing 1.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Gender>Male</Gender>
    <DuringCombat>Lokansir isn't too bright, and his combat tactics reflect that. He rarely bothers moving around much in combat except to get in reach of enemies to crush them with his favorite club. He avoids using his earth-shaking bellow while underground, but if brought below 50 hit points and unable to merge with earth, he'll use this ability in desperation.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Lokansir melds into earth if reduced below 50 hit points and waits for his fast healing to heal him completely before emerging. If somehow prevented from using this tactic, the desperate giant tries to flee out of the caves up into Jorgenfist to find more earth to hide in. If he manages to heal back to his full hit points, he tracks down the PCs for revenge.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>Each lamia casts magic vestment at the start of her day&amp;#8211;if the PCs arrive at this room after sundown, that spell has expired. If the lamias hear the dragons or trolls fighting to the north or south, they take several rounds to cast preparatory spells (freedom of movement, bull's strength, mirror image, and finally protection from good) before moving into the neighboring room to join the battle.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Each lamia casts divine favor on the first round of combat, then moves in to fight the enemy in melee. They focus their attacks on the same target, one lamia attacking with her melee attacks while the other casts spells at the target, then they switch off the next round. These lamias are merciless, and if one of them drops to negative hit points, the other doesn't hesitate to use death knell on her dying sister.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If a lamia is reduced to 40 hit points or fewer, she tries to cast sanctuary and then uses her healing magic on herself while attempting to put some distance between her and the PCs. If reduced to 20 hit points, a lamia casts sending to warn Mokmurian before she attempts to flee to another room in this complex, where she can find an ally to aid her.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>Mokmurian casts mage armor and greater magic weapon on his club every morning after he prepares his spells. Once he learns that the PCs are coming (likely via the headless ogre's head), he casts resist energy (to resist a type of energy he knows the PCs favor, or otherwise fire), see invisibility, and stoneskin. If he suspects the PCs are very close, he casts fly and uses his wand of bear's endurance. All of these effects are incorporated into his stats above. He then casts fog cloud near the entrance to the room and waits to ambush the PCs.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Mokmurian's first action when the PCs enter his room is to cast solid fog, catching as many of them as possible in the spell's area of effect. He uses his fog-cutting lenses so he can target the PCs with ease with his ranged attack spells. As soon as someone emerges from the fog, he casts cloudkill on that area, followed by stinking cloud. If a PC gets too close to him, he uses telekinesis to hurl her across the room and hopefully back into one of the fog spell effects. His goal is to maintain range superiority on his enemies, but if melee seems inevitable, he casts mass reduce person first to shrink down foes, coupling that with his quickened shield spell. Then, on the first round of actual melee, he casts enlarge person on himself and begins making melee attacks. If any hounds of Tindalos survive, he calls on them to aid him in battle as well.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Mokmurian fights until reduced to 40 hit points or fewer, at which point he uses dimension doors to retreat to area B13, hoping to get healing from his lamia minions. If they're dead, he flees up to the surface and gathers a group of a dozen stone giants and any of the named giants who still live to mount an attack on the library to finish off the PCs. If the PCs have secured an alliance with Conna and she still lives, she's among the giants whom Mokmurian recruits&amp;#8211;when and if this patrol encounters the PCs, Conna switches sides to aid them, a move that throws the other stone giants into chaos. The next round, half of those giants defect as well, renouncing Mokmurian as an unworthy runt and joining Conna and the PCs against him. In this event, Mokmurian fights again until reduced to fewer than 30 hit points, then tries to use his scroll of limited wish to teleport to Xin-Shalast. Yet unfortunately for him, Karzoug, who has been watching his actions through the link their souls have shared ever since Mokmurian's trip to the City of Greed, has other plans for him (see Development, below).</Morale>

Apart from containing all of the spells he has prepared, this extensive collection also contains most of the spells in the Core Rulebook, up through and including 6th-level spells. Feel free to introduce new spells from other sources via these books&amp;#8211;if you do, you should also consider swapping some of these spells in for those he normally prepares.</OtherGear>

    <SpecialAbilities>Ability Healing (Ex) The Scribbler heals 1 point of ability damage per round in each damaged ability score. Blessed Life (Ex) The Scribbler does not age or breathe and does not require food, drink, or sleep. Divine Swiftness (Ex) The Scribbler gains a +4 bonus on initiative checks and his base speed is 60 feet (or 40 feet when wearing his +1 breastplate). Sacred Site (Ex) The Scribbler is bound to the shrine of Lamashtu (areas A1&amp;#8211;A10), and has been charged by the goddess of nightmares herself with keeping the site sacred and free from intruders and heretics. Should the Scribbler ever move beyond these areas, he loses the divine guardian template and his spellcasting ability until he atones and reenters the site within 1 week. Otherwise, he loses the template permanently and takes 6d6 points of Constitution drain as his body adjusts to the loss.</SpecialAbilities>

    <BeforeCombat>Every day, the Scribbler wards the complex by casting alarm and guards and wards. He also casts nondetection, extended magic vestment, and extended greater magic weapon every day after finishing his daily prayers to Lamashtu. If he has time just before combat begins, he casts stoneskin, spell resistance, freedom of movement, bull's strength, and bear's endurance.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>The Scribbler starts combat by casting summon monster VI to summon 1d3 babaus. While these summoned monsters engage his foes, he casts righteous might and quickened divine favor. He then enters combat, casting a quickened spiritual weapon on that round to attack a spellcaster or healer.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>The Scribbler uses dimension door to retreat to the hallway outside of area A10 if brought below 10 hit points, then hides inside his lair and heals his wounds before returning to continue a fight with intruders. If confronted in area A10, he fights to the death.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Divide (Ex) As a standard action, a mustard jelly can split into two identical jellies, each with half the original's hit points (round down). A mustard jelly with 10 hit points or fewer cannot divide itself. When divided, each jelly moves at a speed of 40 feet. Energy Absorption (Ex) A mustard jelly is immune to electricity and magic missiles. If targeted by such an effect, it gains temporary hit points equal to the damage that attack would have normally done. These temporary hit points last for 1 hour. Toxic Gas (Ex) A mustard jelly exudes an aura of toxic gas in a 10-ft.-radius spread. A creature in this area must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save each round or be slowed (as per slow) for as long as it remains in the area plus an additional 1d4 rounds. This is a poison effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>

    <SpecialAbilities>Brain Consumption (Ex) When Xyoddin makes a successful grapple check to deal damage with his bite against a pinned or helpless living foe, the victim takes 2d4 points of Intelligence drain as Xyoddin consumes portions of his brain. A successful DC 23 Fortitude save halves this Intelligence drain. A creature reduced to 0 Intelligence by this attack is slain. Creatures immune to critical hits and those with multiple heads are not killed by this attack. The save DC is Strength-based. Cannibalistic Healing (Ex) So long as Xyoddin has fed on human flesh within the last 24 hours, he gains fast healing 10. Command Zombies (Su) Xyoddin can automatically command all normal zombies within 30 feet as a free action. Normal zombies never attack him unless they are compelled. Favored Prey (Ex) Xyoddin gains a +2 bonus on damage rolls against humanoids and a +2 bonus on Bluff, Perception, Sense Motive, and Survival checks when using these skills against humanoids. Against humans, these bonuses increase to +4. Hungry Special Attacks (Ex) Humans take a &amp;#8211;2 penalty on saving throws against Xyoddin's special attacks. Ravenous Body (Su) Normally, Xyoddin must eat human flesh at least once every 3 days or he begins to starve, but the sustaining presence radiated by Runeforge prevents this. Sprint (Ex) Once per day, Xyoddin can move at a speed of 300 feet when he makes a charge. Telepathic Bond (Sp) Xyoddin has a permanent telepathic bond with Azaven. Unnatural Aura (Su) Any animal within 30 feet of Xyoddin must succeed at a DC 26 Will save or become panicked, remaining so for as long as it remains within this proximity. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Gender>Male</Gender>
    <BeforeCombat>Xyoddin tears free a portion of the torso's liver and eats it before combat begins if he has a chance, gaining the benefits of fast healing 10 for the fight to come.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>If faced with enemies that include humans in their ranks, Xyoddin's terrible hunger pulls him to them, causing him to ignore all non-human targets. He's able to hold back his ravenous urgings enough to resist taking the time to feast on a slain human if other enemies remain to defeat, but only barely.</DuringCombat>

    <SpecialAbilities>Contingency (Sp) If Azaven is grappled, a dimension door spell activates on him. Azaven uses this to merely reposition himself in combat if the battle is going well&amp;#8211;if it is going poorly, he uses it to flee to area F11. Telepathic Bond (Sp) Azaven has a permanent telepathic bond with his minion Xyoddin and with one of the Thassilonian mummies in areas F1 and F8.</SpecialAbilities>

    <ProhibitedSchools>abjuration, enchantment</ProhibitedSchools>
    <BeforeCombat>Once he knows interlopers have invaded the crypts, Azaven casts extended false life and tongues on himself. He then calls a devourer&amp;#8211;a proud being named Vioidzhain, scarred with symbols only it knows the otherworldly source of&amp;#8211;to guard him using his staff of hungry shadows. As soon as he can before combat, he casts quickened cat's grace.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Azaven opens battles by casting finger of death at a spellcaster and quickened displacement on himself. He then casts wall of force to seal himself off from the PCs, giving him time to cast fly, mirror image, and spectral hand. During this time, he lets the conjured devourer keep the PCs busy. If the PCs haven't breached his wall by the time he's done casting preparatory spells, he uses dimension door to return back into their midst and begins casting offensive spells. If he needs more minions, Azaven casts stone shape on a nearby wall to release several wraiths, hoping they provide additional distractions.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Azaven values his own immortal existence too much to stick around in a fight he's losing. If reduced to fewer than 30 hit points, he uses mislead to escape by casting gaseous form and retreating to area F11, where he gathers his phylactery before triggering the trap in the room to heal his damage. Given time, he recovers his spells and then seeks revenge on the PCs. If confronted there, Azaven has little choice but to fight until destroyed, but he makes sure to trigger the trap in the room before a fight begins.</Morale>

    <DuringCombat>If caught off guard, Ordikon uses dimension door to travel to area G8, casts his short-term defensive spells as outlined above, then returns to G6 to confront the PCs.

    <SpecialAbilities>Beauty of Blood (Ex) Submissives are immune to bleed damage, and take 1 fewer point of damage from all slashing attacks. Mistress (Ex) The succubus Delvahine is the mistress to all four of these alu-demon submissives. If any of these alu-demons ever willingly disobeys Delvahine or willingly allows her to come to harm, they lose all of their supernatural abilities save for their vampiric claws, and take a permanent &amp;#8211;6 penalty on all saving throws against enchantment effects. If Delvahine dies, these penalties apply as well. Mistress Said So (Su) The alu-demon submissives gain a +1 morale bonus on all attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. Mock Obedience (Su) Any time an alu-demon submissive is affected by a charm or compulsion effect, she may make a second saving throw to break its hold at any time as an immediate action. Pain is Pleasure (Ex) An alu-demon submissive has damage reduction 5/&amp;#8211; against nonlethal damage. Shield the Mistress (Ex) Whenever Delvahine would be hit by a ranged attack or melee attack and the alu-demon submissive is within 5 feet of Delvahine, the submissive may make a DC 20 Reflex save to be hit by the attack instead. If Delvahine is forced to make a Reflex save against an effect that normally allows a Reflex save for half damage, the submissive may make that Reflex save against the effect to take the full damage from the effect while preventing any of that damage from harming the mistress. Evasion does not protect the submissive from this particular damage. The submissive must be aware of the attack and cannot be flat-footed in order to use this ability. She can attempt to shield the mistress against up to 8 attacks per round. Tirelessness (Ex) A submissive gains a +5 bonus on saving throws against sleep and fatigue effects. Vampiric Claws (Su) Each time an alu-demon damages a foe with her claw attack, she gains temporary hit points equal to the amount of damage she inflicted. She cannot gain more hit points in one strike than her target's current hit points + the target's Constitution score (which is enough to kill the target). These temporary hit points vanish in 1 hour.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Gender>Female</Gender>
    <DuringCombat>The alu-demons start combat by using suggestion on heavily armored foes, suggesting that those foes take off their armor and gear so the demons can "get a better look at them." They then attempt to use charm person against any foes who resist this initial suggestion. They avoid melee as long as they can, hovering just out of reach of non-flying foes and using their ranseurs. If one alu-demon is forced into melee, the others join their sister, one flanking the foe and the others standing directly behind their sisters to attack with the ranseur via reach so all four can attack one target at a time.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If reduced to fewer than 50 hit points, an alu-demon uses dimension door to travel to area H7 and takes up a protective position at her mistress's side. If that alu-demon has a charmed PC, she takes that PC with her when she retreats. Delvahine may or may not offer her children and their new pets healing.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Energy Drained Nelevetu currently suffers from 10 permanent negative levels, courtesy of encounters with Delvahine. The penalties to his stats and hit points from these negative levels have been calculated into the stats above. Schizophrenic Nelevetu suffers from madness&amp;#8211;specifically, from a potent case of schizophrenia (see GameMastery Guide 251). This debilitating condition makes him take a &amp;#8211;4 penalty on all Wisdom- and Charisma-based skill checks. In addition, it prevents him from ever taking 10 or 20 on any roll. In addition, he must make a DC 16 Will save each round he's in a stressful situation (such as combat) to resist becoming confused for 1d6 rounds.</SpecialAbilities>

    <DuringCombat>If attacked, Nelevetu shrieks and cries, but does his best to fight back to defend himself&amp;#8211;although it's more likely he'll become confused due to his schizophrenia. The noise he makes, if outside of his cage, is enough to alert all of the inhabitants of the Iron Cages, who come to investigate at once. If cured of his madness, Nelevetu is grateful and agrees to aid those who saved him in fighting against his oppressors&amp;#8211; particularly if they remove his negative levels and give him equipment he can use.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Nelevetu fights to the death, regardless of the state of his mind and soul&amp;#8211;he's not suicidal, but after as long as he's lived, he certainly no longer fears death.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Agonizing Touch (Su) Delvahine can deal 1d3 points of nonlethal damage with a touch attack at will as a standard action. She deals an additional 1d3 points of nonlethal damage with her natural attacks. Binding Whip (Ex) Delvahine does not provoke attacks of opportunity when she uses a whip in melee. She can also attempt to entangle a Large or smaller foe with a whip&amp;#8211;to do so, she makes a touch attack against a target. If she hits, the target is entangled. If she succeeds at an opposed Strength check against the target, the target can not move farther than 15 feet away from Delvahine. An entangled creature can escape with a successful DC 20 Escape Artist check (a full-round action) or DC 25 Strength check, or by sundering the whip. As long as she entangles a foe with her whip, Delvahine cannot use that whip to make additional attacks. Delvahine can release a foe from her binding whip as an immediate action. Deadly Whip (Ex) Delvahine can choose to deal normal damage with a whip rather than nonlethal damage. Enchantment Specialization (Ex) Delvahine gains a +1 bonus to overcome SR when she casts dominate person, and the save DC of any dominate person spell she casts increases by 1. Penetrating Whip (Su) Delvahine can harm any foe with her whip, regardless of the foe's armor or natural armor bonuses.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Gender>Female</Gender>
    <BeforeCombat>Delvahine is unlikely to be caught off guard by the PCs since her daughters keep in telepathic contact with her. Once she knows the PCs are approaching (either at her permission or otherwise), she casts freedom of movement, eagle's splendor, and mirror image.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Delvahine prefers to fight with allies, particularly her submissive daughters, who are well trained at protecting her. She uses her bardic performance to inspire courage on the first round of combat, then moves on to use dominate person and confusion against her foes. If forced to fight in melee, she fights with dagger and sadist's lash, using Arcane Strike each round to deal an additional 3 points of damage with each hit.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Delvahine teleports to area I2 if brought below 20 hit points&amp;#8211;as distasteful as it is to her, she hopes to seek aid from Vraxeris. When she discovers he is dead and only his simulacra remains, she assumes his form, allies with his simulacra, and awaits the PCs' arrival in that wing to seek revenge.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Demonically Obese (Ex) While Jordimandus's fat grants a +4 natural armor bonus, it reduces his base speed to 10 feet. Heart of Slime (Su) Jordimandus's heart grants a +6 profane bonus to Constitution and renders him immune to critical hits and sneak attacks. The heart also effectively makes him immortal by ceasing his aging and nourishing him. Oozes do not attack Jordimandus as a result of his unholy heart. If all four of the variant ochre jellies in the surrounding pipes are slain, Jordimandus's access to the life-giving humors ceases and his heart begins to decay. He immediately loses all the benefits granted him by the heart, and furthermore takes 1d6 points of Constitution drain each day until he perishes.</SpecialAbilities>

    <DuringCombat>Jordimandus starts combat by summoning monsters, using quickened acid arrows while he does. He resorts to offensive spells only once there's a nice group of summoned monsters to protect him from melee. He stays in his throne until menaced in melee, at which point he uses flight, dimensional steps, and dimension door to stay away from the PCs. Jordimandus carries his rod of absorption at all times&amp;#8211;he does not carry a weapon at all, relying entirely on magic in combat.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Jordimandus is something of a coward&amp;#8211;if he's brought down to fewer than 30 hit points, he drops to his knees and begs for his life. While he can't leave this room without dying, he's learned quite a lot about Runeforge and its inhabitants&amp;#8211; information that the PCs can use to their advantage (see Treasure, below).</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Arrows of Wrath (Su) When the iron archer attacks with its bow, it fires arrow-shaped bolts of energy. These arrows deal 3d6 points of damage on a hit. On the first round of combat, these arrows deal fire damage. On the second round, they deal electricity damage. On the third they deal cold damage. On the fourth round, they switch back to fire and the cycle repeats. If the iron archer ceases to use its arrows (to make a melee attack, for example), the cycle restarts with fire arrows the next time it fires.</SpecialAbilities>
    <DuringCombat>The iron archer focuses its attacks on opponents who get past it into the corridor to the exclusion of all others, until the target is dead or flees. If no opponent gets past it, the iron archer focuses on flying foes.</DuringCombat>

    <SpecialAbilities>Mark of Wrath (Su) Highlady Athroxis wears the mark of her rulership on her flesh&amp;#8211;a faintly glowing tattoo-like rune on her forehead that moves through the generations from one ruler to the next. The mark of wrath provides her with a +1 insight bonus to AC and on attack and damage rolls. Once per day as a swift action, she can call upon the mark to protect her with a fire shield (CL 15th). If she is slain in combat, the mark of wrath transfers to the brow of her defeater. It can only be transferred again on that character's death at the hands of another, but can be removed with a successful break enchantment against CL 20th. Once removed in this manner, it vanishes forever.</SpecialAbilities>

    <DuringCombat>Athroxis casts haste immediately before combat begins, and then uses her cone of cold spells. She favors spells like blindness/deafness and her still spells, since they aren't impacted by her spell failure chance. When she engages in melee, she uses Combat Expertise&amp;#8211;this penalizes her attack rolls by &amp;#8211;4 but increases her AC by +4.</DuringCombat>

    <SpecialAbilities>Petrification (Su) A creature struck by the statue's slam attack must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or take 1d10 points of Dexterity drain. A creature drained to 0 Dexterity becomes petrified. The save DC is Constitution-based. Shattering Blow (Su) If the Karzoug statue ever damages a petrified creature with its slam attack, that creature must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or be shattered into fragments. This essentially kills the PC, but also deals 3d10 points of slashing damage to all creatures within a 5-foot radius of the shattered statue. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <DuringCombat>The stone golem uses its slow ability on the party every chance it gets, moving to place itself in an optimal position before activating this power. It focuses its physical attacks on the character who created the dominant weapon. Fortunately for that character, this newly enhanced weapon bypasses all damage reduction possessed by the stone golem.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Karzoug can maintain the golem's animation for only 4 rounds. If the PCs still live on the fifth round, the statue spends a round just speaking: "This… this is not the last… come then, heroes. Seek me atop Mhar Massif, if you value life so poorly. You should be honored to be the first fools executed under the banner of Shalast in ten thousand…" Karzoug is unable to finish his taunts, though, and the golem reverts to inanimate stone. It does not attack again.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Command the Frozen (Su) Karivek's death at the hands of a supernaturally cold malevolence (the wendigo) has given him ghost power over non-outsider creatures who possess the cold subtype. The ghost can use dominate monster at will on any non-outsider with the cold subtype as a spell-like ability, but can only maintain control in this manner over one creature at a time. Eater of Flesh (Su) As a victim of the wendigo's insidious disease prior to his death, Karivek retains a portion of that sickness within his very being. On a successful critical hit with his vicious bite attack, the ghost tears away a chunk of flesh and consumes it (the flesh becoming ghostly and vanishing as he does so)&amp;#8211;this deals 1d6 points of Constitution and Charisma drain to the victim (DC 22 Fortitude save negates). Frozen Dead (Su) Karivek gains the cold subtype, thanks to his death in this frozen landscape. As long as he's in an area where the temperature is below freezing (as it is on this ledge), he gains fast healing 10. Rejuvenation (Su) Until his bones are returned to the Vekkers' cabin, Karivek's ghost rejuvenates 2d4 days after it is destroyed. Vicious Bite (Su) Karivek threatens a critical hit with his bite on a natural roll of 18&amp;#8211;20. His fangs become solid and razor sharp as they cut through flesh but ignore armor, allowing him to attack with his bite as a touch attack. Karivek adds 1-1/2 times his Charisma modifier as damage to his vicious bite attack. Wounds caused by his vicious bite are deep and gory, causing 1d8 points of bleed damage.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Gender>Male</Gender>
    <DuringCombat>Karivek uses his frightful moan on the first round of combat, then uses telekinesis to hurl non-flying foes off of his ledge. He focuses his melee attacks on larger foes&amp;#8211;victims with the most meat on their bones. If he sees that the frost worm is nearly dead and surrounded by enemies, he'll attempt to kill the worm with his corrupting touch in order to trigger its death throes, knowing that only the supernatural piercing damage can hurt him (and even then, at best, he'll only take half damage from that, due to his incorporeal nature.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Once Karivek engages in battle, he fights until destroyed, knowing he will just rejuvenate in a few days.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Cold Aura (Su) Svevenka emits an aura of cold in a 10-foot radius. Any creature in this range takes 2d6 points of cold damage per round (DC 28 Fort for half). Svevenka can suppress or resume her cold aura as a free action. The save DC is Constitution-based. Exude Ice (Su) At will as a full-round action, Svevenka can exude a circle of slippery ice in a 20-foot-diameter spread centered on her. This ice remains in the affected area, melting away as normal for the ambient temperature. Moving into a square of ice costs two squares of movement, and the DC for Acrobatics and Climb checks in the area increases by +5. Ice Mastery (Ex) Svevenka gains a +1 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls if her foe is touching ice. She never slips or slides on ice unless she wishes, and can climb icy surfaces as though affected by a spider climb spell. Icy Touch (Su) Svevenka's touch deals 1d6 points of cold damage. Attacks she makes with metallic weapons deal +1d6 points of cold damage as well. Anyone who takes this additional cold damage must succeed at a DC 28 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>

    <BeforeCombat>Svevenka casts barkskin, bear's endurance, and cat's grace on herself before revealing herself to the PCs.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Svevenka's first action in combat is to cast antilife shell. She relies on this spell to keep enemies from engaging her in melee while she summons creatures and uses ranged spells against foes. If her foes manage to engage her in melee, she wild shapes into a dire bear to continue the battle.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Svevenka fights until brought below 25 hit points, at which point she flees using transport via plants to escape to the opposite side of the Icemists; she does not seek another confrontation with the PCs.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>The Hidden Beast casts extended false life on itself every day and places a silent mental alarm at each of the room entrances. It uses its ring of invisibility to remain invisible at all times.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>The Hidden Beast concentrates on maintaining the illusion of the undead speaker, hoping the PCs waste at least a round fighting it while its vampire minions move into position around them. The creature uses ventriloquism to disguise its actual location, taking the first few rounds of combat to cast displacement, mirror image, and shield on itself. The Hidden Beast is fond of using telekinesis to disarm foes, but it generally starts its offense by casting phantasmal killer or lightning bolt. It avoids melee combat unless it can engage a foe one-on-one.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If reduced to 0 hit points, the Hidden Beast automatically assumes gaseous form and attempts to escape through the fissures in and around the dais in the center of this room. These narrow fissures lead down 30 feet to a circular cavern, 20 feet in diameter, that serves as the Hidden Beast's "coffin." Once at rest here, it rematerializes and is helpless. It regains 1 hit point after 1 hour, then it is no longer helpless and resumes healing at the rate of 5 hit points per round from its fast healing. Once fully healed, it seeks out the PCs for swift and brutal revenge, losing sight of all other tasks until it succeeds at this quest.</Morale>

    <DuringCombat>Once combat begins, the hidden skulks move along the walls of the room and attempt to take up positions where they can move as pairs to flank foes. They continue to fight two-on-one as long as possible to maximize their sneak attacks. They prefer to fight foes who do not possess silver weapons, breaking off combat with those who use such weapons to seek easier prey if possible.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>The vampire skulks fight until reduced to 0 hit points, at which point they turn gaseous and drift toward the balcony to the northwest. Once there, they seep through cracks in the wall into a room under the balcony in which their coffins (actually nothing more than narrow niches in the floor) wait for them to rest and recover.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>Just before he starts a fight, Gamigin attempts to summon 2d4 bone devils to aid him.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Gamigin lets summoned devils engage foes in melee while he wreaks havoc with mobility, using wall of ice to break up enemy tactics. Cone of cold, ice storm, and charm person are favorites to use at range, but once he's engaged in melee he abandons his spell-like abilities and focuses his anger on obvious healers before moving on to other enemies.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Gamigin has lived for thousands of years by knowing when he's outclassed, but he's never been confronted here in Xin-Shalast. He cuts it close to the edge as a result, fleeing to a distant hideout via greater teleport only if reduced to fewer than 20 hit points. He does not return to Xin-Shalast anytime soon if he escapes in this manner.</Morale>

    <DuringCombat>The mountain roper lashes out at the closest foes, but isn't unintelligent. It knows to focus its first attacks on heavily armored foes.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>The mountain roper is usually hungry, but it's not foolish&amp;#8211;it won't fight to the death if it can help it. If reduced to fewer than 50 hit points, the monster attempts to break off combat and bargain for its life. If the PCs can communicate and agree to parley, the mountain roper becomes an unlikely source of information&amp;#8211;it knows much about the region, and you can use it to guide the PCs toward creatures that possess Sihedron rings or otherwise encourage them along whatever track of exploration you wish.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Exceptional Wealth Viorian has gear equal to a 17th level PC, and as such her CR is +1 higher than normal. Inherent Bonuses In order to ensure his champion is as powerful as possible, Karzoug has used wish spells to grant Viorian a +5 inherent bonus to Strength and Dexterity and +4 inherent bonuses to Constitution and Wisdom. Permanent Spells Viorian has telepathic bond as a permanent spell effect at CL 20th (placed by Karzoug). Runelord Champion (Ex) Viorian bears the rune of greed upon her left shoulder, a physical manifestation of her role as Karzoug's champion. She has pledged herself to his service, body and soul, and as long as Karzoug lives (even while that life is confined to the far side of the runewell), she gains complete immunity to mind-affecting effects. In addition, she possesses SR 32 against spells from the school of transmutation. Unfortunately, being the champion of greed also brings with it an associated weakness against domineering runeforged weapons&amp;#8211;she qualifies as a transmuter for that weapon's bane effects, and critical hits made against her with such weapons automatically confirm.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Gender>Female</Gender>
    <DuringCombat>On the first round of combat, Viorian drinks her potion of haste. After this, her tactics are simple&amp;#8211;she selects the strongest-looking foe and focuses her wrath upon him, moving to other foes only when her current target is defeated. She uses Power Attack and Vital Strike when she isn't making a full attack, but abandons this tactic when making a full attack with Chellan and a shield bash.</DuringCombat>

Beyond its first manifestation in the room (made possible only by the Leng Device's fluctuation of energy), this hound of Tindalos cannot use its angled entry ability at all.

    <BeforeCombat>Khalib casts false life, overland flight, and nondetection on himself every day. Once an alarm is raised, he also casts stoneskin, quickened shield, and cat's grace on himself before entering battle. He casts greater magic weapon on his masterwork dagger as well, even though he's long believed that if he's been forced to resort to using his dagger in combat, something has gone horribly wrong.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Khalib begins his battles by casting summon monster spells, augmenting them with quickened spells at the same time, as appropriate. He's not all that concerned that these monsters aren't attuned to the occluding field&amp;#8211; since if they're cut down early by the zone's damaging pulses, he can always summon more. He saves temporal stasis for particularly troublesome enemy spellcasters. He prefers to fight alongside giants and lamias, and if he finds the PCs before they're already in a fight, he attempts to rally the nearest group of monstrous allies to attack before he confronts them.</DuringCombat>

    <BeforeCombat>Ceoptra activates her spirit shield and casts greater magic weapon on her dagger. She also casts endure elements on herself every morning. Once she realizes the PCs are in the Pinnacle, she casts air walk and death ward on herself. If possible, just before combat begins, she casts sending to warn Karzoug his enemies are near.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Ceoptra prefers to let her giant minions engage the PCs at first while she hangs back and uses her attack spells at range. As soon as one warden of wind dies, she abandons this tactic and enters melee as well. She is fond of using Quicken Spell to augment her melee attacks, adding quickened blindness/deafness, contagion, hold person, and sound burst to full attacks. She uses quickened healing spells on herself each round she has fewer than 150 hit points. Remember that quickened spells do not provoke attacks of opportunity, so she doesn't need to cast defensively when utilizing this tactic in combat.</DuringCombat>

    <SpecialAbilities>Contingency (Sp) If Karzoug ever becomes affected by a hostile spell effect that prevents him from acting on his own, that spell effect is targeted by a greater dispel magic spell. Exceptional Stats (Ex) Karzoug was destined from birth to become one of the greatest wizards of his age. As a result, his ability scores were generated using 25 points, rather than using the standard 15 point buy used to create most NPCs. Additionally, Karzoug has much more gear than an NPC of his level would normally have. These modifications increase his total CR by +2. Immortal (Ex) Secrets from ancient Thassilon and the realm of Leng have allowed Karzoug to sustain his life indefinitely. Unless slain by violent means, he is immortal. He gains the +3 bonus to his Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores for having lived beyond venerable age, yet retains the youth of a young man and does not gain the penalties to Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. This immortality also grants Karzoug complete immunity to disease and to all forms of madness (including confusion effects and feeblemind). Inherent Bonuses (Ex) Karzoug has used wish spells to increase his stats. He has a +5 inherent bonus to his Intelligence, and a +4 inherent bonus to his other five ability scores. Permanent Spells (Sp) Karzoug has made the following spells permanent on himself: arcane sight, darkvision, see invisibility, and tongues.</SpecialAbilities>

    <BeforeCombat>Karzoug casts mind blank and false life at the start of every day.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Karzoug starts combat seated upon his immense throne, and strives to remain out of melee as long as possible. On the first round of combat, he casts meteor swarm on the party, then uses his rod of greater quicken metamagic to cast time stop as a quickened spell. During the 1d4+1 rounds he gains, he casts spells like prismatic wall, wall of force, and cloudkill among the PCs to disrupt their tactics, and casts defensive spells on himself like spell turning, true seeing, and globe of invulnerability. He'll also use his wand of stoneskin on himself during this time. He'll repeat this tactic on the second round (pairing a quickened time stop with horrid wilting this time) to finish casting any spells he didn't get a chance to cast the first time. On following rounds, Karzoug hits the PCs with area-affecting spells like wail of the banshee and finger of death, saving spells like temporal stasis and maze to use against anyone who seems to be particularly dangerous. Karzoug's glaive takes actions on its own as well, unleashing fireballs on non-spellcasters and curing Karzoug of wounds whenever he drops below 220 hit points. If it comes down to melee, Karzoug releases his glaive to dance as soon as possible, fighting with his talons and using quickened spells like lightning bolt and magic missile to support his attacks. Whenever he drops below 200 hit points (or otherwise suffers a crippling effect) he casts wish to restore himself and his living allies to full health.</DuringCombat>

    <SpecialAbilities>Breath Weapon (Su) Three times per day, a magaav can exhale a noxious cloud of reeking corruption upon a creature within 5 feet. The target must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d4 rounds. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by the same magaav's breath weapon for 24 hours. This is a poison effect. Infernal Wound (Su) The damage a magaav deals with its claws or rend inflicts persistent wounds that cause 1 point of bleed damage. Bleed damage caused by an infernal wound is particularly difficult to stanch&amp;#8211;a successful DC 18 Heal check stops the damage, and any attempt to heal a creature suffering from an infernal wound must succeed at a DC 18 caster level check or the spell does not function. Success indicates the healing works normally and stops all bleed effects on the victim. Master Grappler (Ex) A magaav can wield a weapon in both hands and still attempt to grapple. If it's not wielding a weapon, a magaav gains a +4 bonus on combat maneuver checks to grapple. A magaav does not provoke an attack of opportunity when attempting to grapple. Shared Senses (Su) All host devils (gaavs and magaavs) within 100 feet of each other share the same senses. If one individual perceives something, all others within range are immediately aware of it. It is still possible for a magaav to be surprised or flat-footed even if other host devils within range are not.</SpecialAbilities>
    <BeforeCombat>The magaav commander drinks its potion of invisibility before combat.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>The magaav commander uses telepathy and shared senses to direct the attacks of the murder magaavs, while attacking foes with its bardiche and claws, or grappling enemies with its spiked armor.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If all of the murder magaavs are slain, the magaav commander teleports back to the Abrogail's Fury to report failure. Otherwise, it fights to the death.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Breath Weapon (Su) Three times per day, a magaav can exhale a noxious cloud of reeking corruption upon a creature within 5 feet. The target must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d4 rounds. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by the same magaav's breath weapon for 24 hours. This is a poison effect. Infernal Wound (Su) The damage a magaav deals with its claws or rend inflicts persistent wounds that cause 1 point of bleed damage. Bleed damage caused by an infernal wound is particularly difficult to stanch&amp;#8211;a successful DC 17 Heal check stops the damage, and any attempt to heal a creature suffering from an infernal wound must succeed at a DC 17 caster level check or the spell does not function. Success indicates the healing works normally and stops all bleed effects on the victim. Master Grappler (Ex) A magaav can wield a weapon in both hands and still attempt to grapple. If it's not wielding a weapon, a magaav gains a +4 bonus on combat maneuver checks to grapple. A magaav does not provoke an attack of opportunity when attempting to grapple. Shared Senses (Su) All host devils (gaavs and magaavs) within 100 feet of each other share the same senses. If one individual perceives something, all others within range are immediately aware of it. It is still possible for a magaav to be surprised or flat-footed even if other host devils within range are not.</SpecialAbilities>

    <DuringCombat>While the PCs deal with the major image, the murder magaavs study their foes for 3 rounds in preparation to make death attacks. Thereafter, they attack in pairs, flanking with one another to make sneak attacks using their Outflank and Precise Strike feats.</DuringCombat>

    <SpecialAbilities>Ravenous Hounds (Sp) Once per day as a standard action, a duppy can bring into being a pack of incorporeal hounds for 1d4+3 rounds. The ravenous hounds attack as a single unit, have a +11 attack bonus, deal 2d6+3 points of force damage on a successful hit, and threaten a critical hit on a natural 20. This ability is otherwise identical to mage's sword (CL 7th). Resurrection Vulnerability (Su) A raise dead or similar spell that is cast on a duppy destroys it (Will save negates). Using the spell in this way does not require any material components. Strength Drain (Su) Creatures hit by a duppy's touch attack must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Strength drain. On each successful attack, the duppy gains 5 temporary hit points. The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <DuringCombat>The duppies summon their ravenous hounds on the first round of combat, then attack with their incorporeal touch attacks. The duppies focus their attacks on obvious pirates and sailors first.</DuringCombat>

    <BeforeCombat>Omara drinks a potion of shield of faith before combat. In addition, her stat block includes the bonuses from Kerdak Bonefist's lord's banner of victory.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>At ranges beyond 80 feet, Omara makes single attacks using her far-reaching sight and Deadly Aim. Once foes are within range, she makes full attacks with her musket using Rapid Shot and Deadly Aim. Omara spends grit as needed, but tries to always save at least 1 grit point to take advantage of deeds such as gunslinger's initiative and quick clear.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Omara fights for the Hurricane King only so long as it seems prudent. If foes reach her crow's nest and engage her in melee combat, or if she is reduced to fewer than 60 hit points, Omara surrenders, offering the secrets of firearms in exchange for her life. Omara doesn't care who wears the Hurricane Crown&amp;#8211;if spared, she offers her services to whoever is named the Hurricane King (see Concluding the Adventure).</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Shrieking Frenzy (Su) Once per day, a charau-ka can enter a state of shrieking frenzy as a free action. While in this state, the charau-ka automatically fails Stealth checks and cannot speak or cast spells that use verbal components (or use items that require command words to activate), but functions as if under the effects of a haste spell. The charau-ka can continue shrieking for up to 3 rounds, after which it is staggered for 1 round. Thrown-Weapon Mastery (Ex) Charau-ka are masters of thrown weapons. All charau-ka gain Throw Anything as a bonus feat. In addition, charau-ka gain a +1 racial bonus on all thrown weapons, and their threat range for thrown weapons is doubled, as if they possessed the Improved Critical feat for all thrown weapons. This effect doesn't stack with any other effect that expands the threat range of a weapon.</SpecialAbilities>

    <BeforeCombat>When the alarm is sounded, Powderpot drinks his feral mutagen and extracts of aid, blur, bull's strength, and shield. In addition, his stat block includes the bonuses from the lord's banner of victory flying from the mainmast.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Powderpot throws explosive bombs at attackers, using his precise bombs discovery to avoid hitting the boatswain's mates. If attackers engage him in melee combat, Powderpot uses his boarding pike in an attempt to fend them off, but if anyone gets past his reach, he goes into a shrieking frenzy and attacks with his bite and claws. If he runs out of bombs, Powderpot drinks his extract of fire breath or hurls alchemical items such as alchemist's fire or liquid ice at foes.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Powderpot happily serves as the Filthy Lucre's mascot, but he is intelligent enough to recognize a losing battle when he's in one. If reduced to 20 hit points or fewer, he drinks his extract of gaseous form and attempts to retreat to safety.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>Druvalia casts greater magic weapon on her crossbow every day. Once it's clear that her flagship is going to be attacked, she casts freedom of movement, heroism, ward the faithful (which affects her allies as well), defile armor, and invisibility purge. She also drinks a potion of bull's strength and casts weapon of awe on her crossbow.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>At the beginning of combat, Druvalia casts divine power and flames of the faithful on her crossbow, and activates her judgment ability, typically making destruction and justice judgments, switching to other judgments as needed to counter the tactics of her opponents. While her allies engage foes in melee combat, Druvalia attacks with her crossbow, using her Deadly Aim and Rapid Shot feats. She alternates these attacks with spells such as flame strike, rebuke, or blistering invective. If her opponents are able to hit her with their attacks, Druvalia casts unwilling shield on an enemy combatant. All crew members aboard the Abrogail's Fury carry a case of five bolts for Druvalia's crossbow, and are trained to reload her crossbow whenever they are adjacent and she calls for ammunition, to save her the time of reloading it herself.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If reduced to fewer than 30 hit points, Druvalia dismisses her invisibility purge and drinks a potion of invisibility, retreating to the poop deck of the Abrogail's Fury or her cabin belowdecks to use her wand to heal herself before re-entering the fray. Druvalia has wagered everything on victory and fights to the death rather than surrender to pirates, knowing her soul is lost to Geryon whatever happens.</Morale>
    <Gear>potions of bull's strength (2), potions of invisibility (2), wand of cure critical wounds (20 charges)</Gear>

    <SpecialAbilities>Aging Effects (Ex) Although Kerdak Bonefist is of old age, he has imbibed 2 doses of sun orchid elixir (The Inner Sea World Guide 301). As a result, he suffers none of the penalties while retaining the bonuses of his advanced age. Exceptional Resources (Ex) As Hurricane King of the Shackles, Kerdak Bonefist has the wealth of a PC rather than an NPC, and his ability scores use a 20-point build. These advantages increase his CR by 1. Pirate Tricks (Ex) With a DC 20 Profession (sailor) check once per day, Bonefist can double his ship's base movement for 1 round. He gains a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls with a cutlass, rapier, or short sword. He can drink for free and gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks in any of his 10 "favored taverns." If he deals damage with his sneak attack, Bonefist can make an Intimidate check as an immediate action to demoralize the damaged opponent. As a full-round action once per day, Bonefist can shout orders to his crew; any allies within 30 feet who can hear him gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls or on a particular skill check for 10 rounds. Bonefist treats all storms as if they were one category less severe for the purposes of sailing and navigation. He can make an Acrobatics check to move his normal speed across uneven ground, and does not take a penalty on any Acrobatics checks due to slightly slippery, slightly unsteady, or moderately unsteady conditions.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Gender>Male</Gender>
    <BeforeCombat>When opponents board the Filthy Lucre, Bonefist drinks potions of barkskin and shield of faith. In addition, his stat block includes the bonuses from the lord's banner of victory flying from the mainmast. Before stepping on deck, he uses the Hurricane Crown to cast winds of vengeance.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Bonefist dusts himself with dust of disappearance and activates his boots of speed, using his sniper goggles to make sneak attacks at range with his pistol. Whenever possible, he makes full attacks, using his Rapid Shot and Deadly Aim feats. He uses his invisibility and flight to stay out of reach of melee combatants, and his Snap Shot feats to make attacks of opportunity with his pistol. If possible, Bonefist tries to remain within 40 feet of enemies to take advantage of his pistol's touch attack. In melee combat, Bonefist uses his vampiric touch ability and rapier, but retreats again to range as soon as possible.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If reduced to 50 hit points or fewer, Bonefist flees belowdecks to heal himself and ambush pursuers. Arrogant and stubborn to the last, Bonefist refuses to abandon his ship and fights to the death to keep his crown.</Morale>
    <Gear>dust of disappearance (2 uses), feather tokens (anchor, fan, and swan boat), potions of barkskin +5 (2), potions of cure serious wounds (2), potion of lesser restoration, potion of neutralize poison, potion of remove curse, potion of remove disease, potions of shield of faith +5 (2), entangling shot alchemical cartridges (10)</Gear>

    <BeforeCombat>Tsadok drinks his potion of blur before entering combat.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Tsadok opens fire on the first round of combat with his doubleshot pepperbox, making a full attack by firing two barrels at a time at the most heavily armored opponent. When his pistol is empty, Tsadok drops the pepperbox, draws his falchion, and rages. The stat block above includes the extra bonuses from his furious falchion. Tsadok waits for opponents to come to him, using his unexpected strike rage power to make attacks of opportunity against foes who engage him. He activates his guarded stance rage power and makes Power Attacks, using his auspicious mark rage power to turn a miss into a hit if necessary, and attempts to sunder the weapons of anyone attacking him in melee.</DuringCombat>

    <SpecialAbilities>Detect Chaos (Sp) This ability functions like a paladin's detect evil ability, save that it detects chaos. Disciplines (Sp and Su) Valeria has access to the Hellknight disciplines of tracker and vigilance. Twice per day, she can summon an eagle, riding dog, wolf, or leopard as if using a summon monster spell, but the duration is 1 hour. In addition, Valeria gains low-light vision, and as a full-round action twice per day, she can see through up to 5 feet of wood or stone for as long as she concentrates (maximum 6 rounds). Metal or denser barriers block this effect. Force of Will (Ex) Valeria gains a +4 bonus on Will saves against spells with the compulsion descriptor and a +2 bonus on Will saves against spells with the fear descriptor. Hellknight Armor (Ex) Valeria has earned the right to wear a special type of masterwork full plate called Hellknight plate armor (Inner Sea World Guide 290). While wearing Hellknight plate, Valeria reduces the armor check penalty by 2, increases the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by 1, and moves at full speed. Order Valeria is a member of the Order of the Scourge. Smite Chaos (Su) This ability functions as the paladin's smite evil ability, but against chaotic-aligned creatures. This ability is twice as effective against outsiders with the chaotic subtype, chaotic-aligned aberrations, and fey.</SpecialAbilities>

    <BeforeCombat>Once the Abrogail's Fury comes under attack, Valeria drinks her potion of cat's grace and uses her tracker discipline to summon a leopard to help defend Admiral Druvalia Thrune. The effects of Druvalia's ward the faithful spell are already included in Valeria's stat block.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Valeria stays close to her mistress, Druvalia Thrune, throughout any combat, using her Bodyguard and In Harm's Way feats to intercept attacks meant for the admiral. If forcibly separated from her charge, she does everything in her power to get back to Druvalia's side. Valeria uses the reach of her bardiche to keep foes at a distance while the Chelish marines deal with them. She casts detect chaos as a move action to determine if any enemies are chaotic, then focuses her attacks on those foes, using her smite chaos ability and Improved Vital Strike with her axiomatic bardiche, using her pole fighting ability, if necessary, to shorten her grip on her weapon to attack adjacent foes. If knocked overboard, Valeria drinks her potion of fly to return to Druvalia's side.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Valeria is enraged if Druvalia is killed, and fights to the death to avenge her.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>Ayala uses her 2 vials of bloodroot to poison her bladed scarf and one arrow.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Ayala starts combat by making a sneak attack with her bow if she wins initiative; otherwise, she works with her donkey rats to flank foes. If both donkey rats are slain, she retreats up into the Crow, using tanglefoot bags to slow pursuit. If she can't find other Tower Girls to aid her, she picks a hiding spot and waits to ambush the PCs, continuing this cat-and-mouse game as best she can while trusting her damage reduction to keep her from becoming too wounded.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If reduced below 5 hit points, Ayala flees to a safe hiding place, assumes dire rat form, and then flees back to Magnimar. She harbors a grudge&amp;#8211;at this point, she'll swallow her pride and seek out new allies among another Sczarni gang. Eventually, she'll organize revenge against the PCs, perhaps ambushing them with a new gang of recently infected wererats at a later date.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Maggot Spray (Ex) Once per day, an abyssal larva can spew a stream of maggots at a single opponent within 20 feet. The larvae makes a +3 ranged touch attack&amp;#8211;if it hits, the target is sickened for 1d4 rounds (Reflex DC 16 reduces the duration to 1 round). The save DC is Strength-based. Tortured Mind (Ex) An abyssal larva's mind is pain and chaos. As a result, it is immune to mind-affecting effects. In addition, any creature that attempts to contact an abyssal larva with a mind-affecting effect or spell must succeed at a DC 18 Will save or be confused for 1 minute. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +4 racial bonus.</SpecialAbilities>
    <DuringCombat>The larva is barely intelligent, but knows that foes with large weapons hurt more&amp;#8211;it focuses its attacks on the target with the biggest weapon as a result. It pursues foes relentlessly, but can't open doors. It also doesn't differentiate between PCs and the other denizens of this dungeon, and can be used to attack other creatures if the PCs lure it along.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>The larva fights to the death.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Infernal Slave (Ex) Nupperibos are devils, yet they are essentially mindless shells of solidified torment. Like golems, they have no real minds of their own, but rather follow orders and programming instilled within them by more powerful devils. In the case of multiple orders, only the orders of the most powerful devil are followed. They can utilize simple weapons if commanded, attacking with proficiency, and can also manipulate simple objects like doors. Armor, more complex weapons, and complex tools are beyond their ability to comprehend.</SpecialAbilities>

    <DuringCombat>Khrysm throws a bomb (she prefers acid bombs) on the first round of combat if there are still flat-footed targets available. She drinks an extract of shield otherwise (or drinks the potion on the second round), and in the next round uses invisibility, then makes another sneak attack with a bomb the next round. She repeats this tactic until she runs out of invisibility extracts and potions, after which point she levitates up out of reach to throw her remaining bombs. She saves deeper slumber for use against foes that seem capable of reaching her in melee easily.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>When reduced to fewer than 10 hit points, Khrysm uses sound burst to try to stun a few PCs and then flees toward the stairs in area D8 to retreat back down to Nar-Voth&amp;#8211;if she escapes, she does not return anytime soon, but may gather more resources to seek revenge on the PCs at a later date.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Fear of Fire (Ex) A shriezyx within 30 feet of a fire the size of a torch or larger becomes shaken as long as it remains within that range. If damaged by fire, a shriezyx must make a successful Will save (DC equals the amount of fire damage dealt) or become frightened for 1 round. Poison (Ex) Bite&amp;#8211;injury; save Fort DC 14; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Str; cure 1 save. Slowing Toxin (Su) A shriezyx's web is coated with a toxin that deadens the nerves on contact. Any creature struck by a shriezyx's web must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or become slowed (as per the spell) for 1 minute. Each round, a victim may attempt a new DC 14 Fortitude save to end the effect early. This toxin fades quickly from spun webs&amp;#8211;it can only affect targets on the round the web is spun. Existing webs, while they remain sticky and tangled, do not have this slowing effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <DuringCombat>The shriezyx work together, using their webs at first to slow down enemies and then ganging up to flank foes still able to reach them. Any creature that uses fire against them earns both monsters' wrath, and assuming they can avoid becoming frightened, they focus all their attacks on these foes to the exclusion of others.</DuringCombat>

    <BeforeCombat>Once Natalya knows combat is nearing (likely after she hears the PCs fighting elsewhere in her hideout), she uses her wand of mage armor. She uses a scroll of shield as soon as she can once she fears combat will begin.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Natalya uses charm person on non-spellcasters, and grease on beams or ladders leading to her position to prevent anyone from reaching her in melee. She prefers fighting at range with her crossbow and acid splash, but if forced into melee combat relies on her magically increased AC to protect her as she moves around to try to get into positions where she can use sneak attack. If she's confronted by two or more foes in melee, or if she's reduced to 10 or fewer hit points, she uses the Shard of Pride to create a major image of her shooting flames out of the shard to light the room on fire&amp;#8211;she takes care to not put any PC directly in the flames, but puts up illusory fire between herself and any enemies.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Natalya's megalomania prevents her from fleeing or surrendering. If the PCs wish to take her alive, they'll need to keep that in mind and use appropriate tactics on her.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Destined for Greatness (Ex) Sheila Heidmarch's ability scores use a 20-point build, and she has the wealth of a PC rather than an NPC. These advantages increase her CR by 1.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Gender>Female</Gender>
    <DuringCombat>Sheila drinks a potion of haste on the first round of combat. She always fights with the +1 bonus from her quarterstaff allocated to her Armor Class (these modifiers are built into the stats above). Sheila also uses Combat Expertise to further increase her AC by +2, at the cost of a &amp;#8211;2 penalty on attack rolls. Note that since her quarterstaff always deals nonlethal damage, she can make an Intimidate check to demoralize a target as a free action when she damages a foe in that way, thanks to her Enforcer feat.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Sheila never flees combat if allies remain in danger. Otherwise, if reduced to fewer than 15 hit points she makes a fighting retreat or flees.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Devouring Grapple (Ex) The mouth at the center of a baregara's chest automatically deals 2d8+4 points of damage per round to any creature that the demon successfully grapples. Monstrous Challenge (Su) As a standard action, a baregara can make an Intimidate check to demoralize an opponent. If this check is successful, the baregara surges with power and gains the effects of bull's strength and bear's endurance. The caster level is equal to the baregara's Hit Dice. This ability is usable 3 times per day. One-Armed Hold (Ex) A baregara's huge arms allow it to initiate and maintain a grapple without the standard &amp;#8211;4 penalty for not having both hands free.</SpecialAbilities>

    <BeforeCombat>Given time to prepare, Izmiara mounts Bth-Zgragg and hovers above her bed in the center of the chamber. As she waits for the PCs to breach her prismatic wall, she casts protection from law and activates her fiendish boon to add the anarchic and keen special abilities to Iron Lash.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Izmiara begins combat by using her sword's finger of death attack at range, then directs her mount into combat. She hurls herself into battle with all her might, releasing her best powers as soon as she can. Aura of vengeance is followed by cruelties and her touch of corruption. She only uses her kiss attack on those who have fallen but whom she wishes to keep alive, intending to make them pay over long decades for any blemish upon her perfect body.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Confident in her abilities, the Insatiable Queen does not sully herself by surrendering to mortals. She knows that her plans are still far from complete and teleports away to another location in the Moonscar should she be reduced to fewer than 50 hit points, sacrificing her pride for the ability to continue working her sinister machinations to herald Nocticula's apotheosis.</Morale>

Favoring melee over ranged combat, they fight in pairs, working to flank foes or to prevent themselves from being flanked. They rely upon their high AC in combat to protect them from attacks of opportunity. Should they be reduced to 15 hit points or fewer, they drink a potion of cure light wounds.</DuringCombat>

    <DuringCombat>Chanukrah casts invisibility on the first round of combat. She then casts summon monster III each round, switching to summon monster II once she's out of the more powerful spell, hoping to overwhelm the PCs with conjured monsters. She prefers summoning dretches and multiple giant fiendish spiders with summon monster III and lemures and multiple dire rats with summon monster II. She uses her ranged spells and wands against foes who seem to be able to see her or otherwise counter her invisibility, resorting to melee only as a last resort, using arcane strike with each attack to deal an additional +2 points of damage with her guisarme.</DuringCombat>

    <DuringCombat>Quenelle is an excellent tactician, and despite her heavy armor does her best to stay mobile in fights, attempting to flank foes with her underlings or trying to force enemies to move to keep up with her to deny them full attacks. In lieu of making full attacks herself, Quenelle uses Vital Strike and Power Attack. She's not afraid to use Improved Sunder on weapons, particularly if their wielders seems particularly good at dealing damage with them.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If reduced to fewer than 20 hit points, Quenelle makes a fighting retreat up the stairs to area M1, calling any surviving Gray Maidens to her side to cover her retreat. Her goal is to reach Commander Oriana or, preferably, "Sorshen," to gain additional support in defeating the PCs. Otherwise, she fights to the death.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Cursed The effects of the curse affecting Ashamintallu are detailed below and in the description for area M3. As a side effect of the curse, she gains the benefits of the Shard of Lust as if she were carrying it as long as the shard is within a mile of her. Vampiric Claws (Su) Each time Ashamintallu damages a foe with her claw attack, she gains an amount of temporary hit points equal to the amount of damage she dealt. She cannot gain more hit points than her target's current hit points plus the target's Con score (which is enough to kill the target). These temporary hit points vanish in 1 hour.</SpecialAbilities>

    <BeforeCombat>Ashamintallu casts mage armor, protection from good, and shield.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Ashamintallu activates her boots of haste on the first round of combat, then uses flight to hover out of reach from melee attacks while she uses her spells to pick the party apart. Her first act in combat is to use confusion on the PCs, followed by a fireball in the second round. She's fond of using charm monster, charm person, and suggestion to compel enemies to cast aside their weapons and strip off their armor and gear. Once she manages to neutralize the party through enchantments, she picks off the stragglers with her spells and at reach with her guisarme.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If reduced to fewer than 30 hit points, Ashamintallu flees combat using dimension door to area L22, where she begins scouring the dungeon for allies and drinks her potions of cure serious wounds before returning to confront the PCs. If the PCs goad her into revealing her true nature, though, her madness takes over and she fights the PCs to the death.</Morale>

    <DuringCombat>Oriana prefers to fight side-by-side or back-toback with allies or those she commands so as to prevent foes from flanking her, but does not shirk from battle when she must fight on her own. She uses Power Attack against foes at the start of combat, but switches to Combat Expertise whenever she's reduced below 55 hit points. She uses Improved Disarm on foes with her second attack in a round unless the foe appears to be heavily wounded or isn't wielding a dangerous weapon.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Oriana is no coward, and as long as those she commands or allies with still live, she'll fight to the death. On her own, she flees (or surrenders, if flight is impossible) once reduced to fewer than 15 hit points.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Schizophrenia Jasper suffers from schizophrenia (GameMastery Guide 251). He has a &amp;#8211;4 penalty on Wisdom- and Charisma-based skill checks and cannot take 10 or 20. He must make a DC 16 Will save whenever in a stressful situation (such as combat) to avoid becoming confused for 1d6 rounds.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Gender>Male</Gender>
    <DuringCombat>When attacked by the Black Kiss Boys, Jasper must make a DC 16 Will save each round to avoid becoming confused for 1d6 rounds due to his madness. If he acts normally, he fights using total defense. If the PCs step in to help defend him, Jasper hoots, hollers, and jeers the thugs as he moves about to support the PCs by healing them. If Jasper joins the PCs in their journey south, he continues this role, preferring to heal the PCs and keep them alive, since his visions have shown him that without the PCs, the doom he predicts for Magnimar will not come&amp;#8211;the PCs must live if the apocalypse he hopes for so fervently is to occur at all.</DuringCombat>

    <DuringCombat>The Black Kiss Boys focus their attacks on Jasper, who defends himself using total defense rather than fight back. They do lethal damage with their attacks, but as soon as Jasper drops, they abandon him and flee into the city. If the PCs intervene, the thugs turn their attention one at a time to the PCs, only abandoning the attack on Jasper if all three of them are attacked. They prefer to gang up on smaller or less armored foes, flanking to maximize sneak attacks.</DuringCombat>

    <BeforeCombat>Krugulk casts protection from good on himself in the last few seconds before starting combat if he can.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>The boggard chief starts by casting doom, then spiritual weapon. He prefers to hang back and cast spells like bull's strength and guidance on his giant dragonfly, and singles out particularly effective PCs for his bane spell. He doesn't hesitate to cast death knell on a fallen ally if the opportunity presents itself.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Krugulk knows his position in the tribe is dependant on shows of strength, and fights to the death as long as other boggards are still alive to witness it. If all the other boggards are struck down, he immediately flees for the tribe's camp, preparing tales of how he "heroically defeated the monsters that ambushed his group" to explain the suspicious loss of his hunting party.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Smother (Ex) When a lurker above grapples a target, it forms an airtight seal around its prey. A grappled target cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components, and must hold its breath (see the rules for suffocation on page 445 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</SpecialAbilities>
    <DuringCombat>The lurker above has to squeeze while it's inside the gazebo, and as such takes a &amp;#8211;4 penalty on attack rolls and a &amp;#8211;4 penalty to its AC as long as it remains within. It remains in the gazebo until it's no longer grappling a foe, at which point it squeezes out to attack and chase the nearest foe. Canny PCs might be able to get the lurker above to fight the tendriculoses or other creatures in the region.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>The lurker above flees back up to the Asylum Stone's ceiling far above if reduced to 20 or fewer hit points&amp;#8211;it does not return to this region.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>Herifax casts resist energy against any form of energy she's seen the PCs wield, defaulting to fire.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Herifax alerts Kanya with a shriek once she engages in battle, and the catfolk emerges from area A21 on the second round of combat to join the fight. The harpy then attempts to stay well out of range of the PCs, flying high above them while peppering them with arrows. She's particularly fond of using Deadly Aim to deal additional damage to easy targets, and goes for spellcasters and other archers first. If she ever spots a PC wandering alone in the garden, she uses her captivating song to try to get that PC to walk off the edge of the balcony or to stumble into the trash heap and anger the alchemical golem, but otherwise she avoids using this ability, preferring to focus on her arrows in combat.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If Kanya is reduced to negative hit points, Herifax swoops down to stand over her body and try to stabilize her wounds, ignoring any actions taken by the PCs until she's sure the catfolk woman is not dying. Herifax may well beg the PCs to save Kanya (or at the very least allow her the time to try to bind Kanya's wounds) in return for surrendering to them&amp;#8211;if the PCs accept this surrender, the harpy sees this as her chance to get Berkanin out of the picture and promises to aid the PCs in killing the master of the house, provided they heal her up and promise Kanya comes to no harm. Herifax only makes this offer if she thinks Kanya is unconscious&amp;#8211;otherwise, if she's reduced to fewer than 10 hit points, she flees into the city to nurse her wounds and make plans to return to rescue Kanya later.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>If she hears Herifax call the alarm, Kanya pulls the lever that transforms the catwalk in area A20 into a wobbly surface.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Kanya knows her primary strength lies in sneak attacks. If she hears the alarm from Herifax, she enters combat on the second round, favoring her shortbow at first and firing on foes from the doorway. She won't hesitate to clamber onto the wobbly catwalk&amp;#8211;her Acrobatics skill is high enough that she can move around on it at full speed and still never fail her check to avoid falling prone. She evades melee with those she suspects can make sneak attacks while on the catwalk, while simultaneously taking advantage of her enemies' flat-footed conditions while on the wobbly surface to make sneak attacks of her own. If she's confronted elsewhere (such as by stealthy PCs who make it to area A21 without raising an alarm), she drinks her potion of invisibility and seeks out an ally (either Herifax or Berkanin) to fight with rather than fight the PCs alone, although she certainly takes a moment to open the door to area A22 so the constructs within can swarm out to attack.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If she's reduced to fewer than 10 hit points, Kanya flees upstairs to area A23, where she fights to the death to protect Berkanin.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>As soon as Berkanin realizes enemies are approaching, he casts mage armor and protection from arrows. He uses his wand of false life on himself as well.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Berkanin uses his lesser wings of flying to stay aloft and out of melee, occasionally perching on the top of his walls or window casements. At the start of combat, he casts invisibility, then keeps moving while he casts haste and blur the next few rounds. He prefers to lock down opponents with spells like black tentacles or web, then hammer them with area of effect spells. He may also choose the most imposing foe and target her with dominate, turning her against her party. He commands Petey to use its acid spit to the greatest effect, and has no problem sacrificing his familiar to save himself. He has even less regard for the two clockwork soldiers he keeps here as bodyguards&amp;#8211;they're difficult to replace, but if they run interference and make the difference between him surviving or even just being able to cast a spell without being disrupted, they're serving their purpose.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Berkanin knows that he's crossed several lines with his family, and won't bother trying to flee to them if things get grim. Instead, he begs for his life if brought below 10 hit points. He certainly gives up Augustille if the PCs ask, but the troll might not be interested in honoring any surrenders that Berkanin establishes with the PCs. If spared, Berkanin is willing to give his most valuable possession&amp;#8211;his lesser wings of flying&amp;#8211;to the PCs as a bribe for them to take Augustille and leave him alone.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Bloat (Su) Luonim can exert himself as a free action to gain 1d6 blood points twice per day (see Blood Pool, below). Bloatmage Initiate By undergoing elaborate rituals and gruesome rites to increase the amount of blood in his body, Luonim can draw upon additional magical reserves. This feat allows Luonim to cast evocation spells at +1 caster level, but the resulting bloating encumbers him as if he had a medium load. Blood Pool (Su) Luonim has 4 blood points, representing his capacity to draw upon excess blood in his body to fuel his sorcerous magic. He can spend blood points at the time of casting to cast a spell without using that spell's spell slot. Retaining a spell slot in this manner costs a number of blood points equal to the spell's level. Luonim can push himself via his bloat ability in order to gain a number of extra blood points, but such exertion is a dangerous gamble. If his current number of blood points is greater than 4 blood points but less than or equal to 8 blood points, he gains the sickened condition. If he exceeds 8 blood points, he immediately flies into a homicidal rage, striking out randomly with his most damaging attacks and abilities at friends and foes alike for 1d6 rounds or until his blood points are reduced to 0 (whichever comes first). At the end of the rage, his blood points drop to 0 and his hit points drop to &amp;#8211;1. Corpulence (Ex) Luonim is so fat that his rolls of blood-laden flesh grant him a +1 natural armor bonus. Hemophilia (Ex) Bloatmages are particularly susceptible to bleed effects, and the DC of any Heal check made to stop a bleed effect is 5 higher than normal. Anytime Luonim suffers a wound that causes bleed damage, he loses 1 blood point, but he does not lose additional blood points for taking ongoing bleed damage.</SpecialAbilities>

    <BeforeCombat>Luonim casts mage armor at the start of each day, using a point from his blood pool that he then regains by applying his fortifying leeches. He uses a charge from his wand of shield as soon as he fears combat is nearing.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>The gnome bloatmage starts combat by casting invisibility using 2 points from his blood pool, then casts fly to move about the room while the PCs deal with the centrifuge. While invisible, he casts fire shield on himself, then casts summon monster III spells for a few more rounds to summon lantern archons to harass the PCs. Once he's confident the PCs have their hands full, he begins hammering the PCs with shouts, fireballs, and cones of cold. He makes use of his blood pool each round to maximize his spells available.</DuringCombat>

    <DuringCombat>Maligast relies on his damage reduction to blunt most physical attacks, and casts summon monster V on the first round to conjure up 1d3 Medium air elementals. He follows that up by trying to dismiss the most heavily armored PC (remember, here in the Dark Forest, the PCs are extraplanar creatures!), following that up with his combat spells.</DuringCombat>

    <DuringCombat>Having focused his studies on prophecy and diplomacy, Augustille knows few combat spells. Instead, he relies on his natural troll abilities, roaring dramatically (as he imagines his savage brethren might) and charging in with a show of berserk rage, clawing and biting anyone who comes within range and hoping to do enough damage that his opponents lose heart and run. His tongues curse also kicks in during combat, and he shouts in Aklo like a madman.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>On his own, Augustille fights only until it's clear his opponents won't back down, then casts sanctuary and attempts to flee. If defending his friends or under the effects of Berkanin's drugs, he fights to the death.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Behead (Ex) Any creature reduced to negative hit points by one of the Dark Rider's weapon attacks must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or be beheaded. Beheading instantly slays the victim, and its head automatically tumbles down to the Dark Rider's side to attach to his armor via a stained leather cord. The Save DC is Strength-based. Hurl Head (Su) As a standard action up to once every 1d4 rounds, the dark rider may hurl any severed head up to 30 feet. The head explodes on contact into a 20-foot burst of negative energy, dealing 10d6 points of negative energy damage (Reflex DC 22 half) to all creatures in the area of effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. Recruit Hound (Su) Any creature slain by the Dark Rider must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or be immediately returned to life as a shadow mastiff&amp;#8211;one of the dullahan's hounds. The creature's soul remains trapped, cognizant of its fate and able to recognize former companions but unable to directly defy the dullahan's orders. As long as this shadow mastiff lives, the soul cannot be restored to life via raise dead or other effects. The save DC is Charisma-based. Summon Mount (Su) As a standard action, the Dark Rider can summon a unique mount with the statistics given below.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Gender>Male</Gender>
    <DuringCombat>The Dark Rider prefers to fight from horseback, making frequent use of Mounted Combat and Spirited Charge to lash at foes with his spine flail. If forced to dismount, he maneuvers so that he can make full attacks. He uses his hurl head ability against foes who cluster or try to stay at range.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>The Dark Rider has no fear of death. He fights until destroyed, at which point his body disintegrates and sinks into the ground, leaving behind only his armor and gear. His mount immediately dies and fades into nothingness.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Euphoric Slime (Ex) Sanguine oozes are composed of congealed euphoric toxins. Any living creature that begins its turn affected by the swarm's viscous ability must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or erupt into uncontrollable laughter and be effectively staggered for that round. This is a mind-affecting effect. Creatures immune to poison are immune to this effect. Viscous (Ex) Whenever a sanguine ooze swarm makes a swarm attack on a Small or larger creature, that creature must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex save or be covered in patches of sticky ooze globules. Those who fail are entangled until the patches of ooze are removed. The ooze can be removed by spending a full-round action to fling off the globules&amp;#8211; though this action might be impeded by the ooze's effects. If a creature affected by this ability takes any amount of cold damage, the ooze patches are immediately destroyed. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>

    <BeforeCombat>Clankypump casts invisibility if she has time.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Clankypump tries to avoid combat. She inspires the dust mephit minions with courage, then uses glitterdust, hold person, and hideous laughter to keep the PCs disorganized and distracted. She prefers to hold back on physical attacks until she's got the bulk of the party blinded or otherwise incapacitated, in which case she focuses those attacks on any PCs who still remain able to fight back.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If she is reduced to fewer than 20 hit points, Clankypump surrenders, begging for mercy and promising that she can help the PCs. She knows the PCs need the doomsday key to open the door to area A10, and that the key is held by the medusa in area A22. She agrees to help the PCs recover the key if they promise to let her go once they secure the key, but in fact, she attempts to flee as soon as she has a chance to heal herself back to full hit points.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>Every morning at dawn, Sufestra casts status on the two vrocks in area A21. Once that status spell alerts her to combat, she prepares for battle by using a dose of stone salve on herself to gain stoneskin, and 1 dose each on the hill giant and redcap to gain two allies eager to earn their lives back. She ends her preparation by casting freedom of movement, protection from energy (fire), and invisibility on herself.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>If possible, Sufestra hopes to have her giant and redcap minions deal with the PCs. She remains invisible during the first few rounds of combat, moving to cast healing spells on the most wounded ally each round. Once they're defeated, or once she's discovered, she casts confusion on as many PCs as possible (which also exposes the PCs to her gaze attack), then channels negative energy on the following rounds to wear the PCs down.</DuringCombat>

    <BeforeCombat>Gein casts magic vestment on his armor every morning, and casts air walk and death ward if possible before heading into dangerous territory.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Gein's weapon is a +1 merciful spiked chain; as long as its merciful quality is active, the spikes retract into the metal&amp;#8211;he would rather defeat a foe and leave him alive but humbled than dead. Against undead, he prefers to channel energy or cast healing magic.

    <Morale>Gein didn't used to fear death, but his experiences of late have changed his mind&amp;#8211;he flees combat if reduced to fewer than 15 hit points (using deeper darkness to cover his retreat) rather than risk being taken prisoner after being rendered unconscious again.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>Zolerim casts extended mage armor and extended false life every morning. Once he's alerted to trouble, he casts sending to alert Ardathanatus that the PCs are in the dungeon. He casts extended shield, fly, freedom of movement, and extended shield of faith on himself before entering combat.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Zolerim uses flight to stay mobile in combat and relies on his damaging spells to hit the PCs at range, but casts mirror image on the first round of the fight. Whenever he's surrounded and can't get to safety to cast spells, he simply channels negative energy. He heals himself whenever he's reduced to 40 or fewer hit points.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If he's reduced to 20 or fewer hit points, Zolerim casts wall of force to try to seal the PCs off from him, then flees. As soon as he's out of sight, he casts meld into stone to hide in the dungeon floor for an hour or so before emerging. At this point, he heals himself and then moves out into the dungeon to seek the PCs for revenge. He doesn't expect mercy, and if escape isn't an option, he fights to the death. If captured, he is unrepentant, claiming that Nethys cares nothing for petty human politics and that he sided with the source of stronger magic (Ardathanatus), as his god demanded&amp;#8211;he only reveals what he knows of the dungeon if magically compelled. In this case, you can use a charmed or compelled Zolerim to give the PCs whatever hints you wish about the parts of the dungeon they have yet to explore.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>Gathuspia casts invisibility and mage armor before entering combat, and activates her flight hex to increase her combat mobility.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Gathuspia spends the first few rounds of combat using her magic to soften up foes, with lightning bolt and confusion in particular to disrupt and damage, and stinking cloud and web to reduce their mobility. Once she's got the PCs relatively split up, she swoops in to make melee attacks, using Vital Strike with her bite on the first round of combat. She knows her Armor Class is good, but faced against foes who are able to hit her and penetrate her damage reduction, she retreats back to range and relies on magic missiles and other magic. She tries to capture the souls of any slain PCs as soon as possible using soul bind, and if she manages to capture three (and thus fills all three soul jars), she leaves the battle by returning to the ethereal plane, content with her prizes for now.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Gathuspia is unlike many of the other outsiders who serve Ardathanatus in that she hasn't been called here by his magic&amp;#8211;her alliance with the elf is on her own terms. While she values his aid and hopes he succeeds at his mission since that will only increase the number of souls she can harvest, she's not so blindly devoted to his cause that she would lay down her life for him. If reduced to 40 or fewer hit points, she attempts to escape by using etherealness and does not return.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Curse of Envy (Su) Ardathanatus suffers from the curse of the Shard of Envy. He becomes sickened whenever he's within 30 feet of a cleric or elf. Physical contact with another cleric or elf (including being the target of or while delivering touch spells) nauseates Ardathanatus unless he makes a successful DC 20 Fortitude save. Mark of Yamasoth (Su) Ardathanatus has pledged his soul to Yamasoth by undergoing a foul ritual, at the climax of which he gouged out and ate his own left eye. As a result, he gains a +2 profane bonus to his Armor Class and an additional +4 hit points per Hit Die&amp;#8211;but only as long as he remains of value to Yamasoth. In addition, he takes no penalties on Charisma checks made while interacting with conjured qlippoth.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Gender>Male</Gender>
    <BeforeCombat>Ardathanatus casts lesser restoration every day to remove the effects of fatigue brought on by lack of sleep, then casts heroes' feast so that he and the creatures that aid him in his long-running ritual can be fed. He casts magic vestment on his armor and greater magic weapon on his halberd every day. Once he knows that the PCs are drawing near, he also casts air walk, freedom of movement, stoneskin, and spell resistance on himself.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Ardathanatus casts quickened shield of faith on the first round of combat (this bonus is already calculated into his AC above along with repulsion to prevent PCs from approaching him. He then remains at the northern end of the chamber and uses ranged magic such as blade barrier, flame strike, and blasphemy. He resorts to using his halberd in melee once foes come to him, or in the unusual event that he has used up his ranged attack options. Whenever he's reduced to fewer than 150 hit points, he uses a quickened cure spell on himself. He saves heal for when he's fallen below 50 hit points.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Ardathanatus fights to the death, as long as his faith in Yamasoth remains unshaken (but see his Side Quest). If faced with certain defeat, he casts earthquake in a last-ditch attempt to bring down the dungeon on both himself and his enemies.</Morale>
    <Gear>+1 adamantine full plate, flaying halberd, belt of physical might +4 (Str, Con), cloak of resistance +2, doomsday key, headband of inspired wisdom +2, Shard of Envy, spell component pouch, unholy symbol of Yamasoth, diamond dust (for casting stoneskin, worth 750 gp)</Gear>

    <Morale>Casamir tries to flee back to safety (preferably to the Pharus Pharasmae) if reduced to fewer than 10 hit points while no allies are nearby to protect him, wanting to try to stay alive so that he can at least call for help again via sending or report what happened to Windsong Abbey.</Morale>

If she has to move to engage foes in battle, she's fond of making a single attack with her aklys against the target to try to trip it before moving up to attack it. She saves cure moderate wounds to use on an ally knocked down to negative hit points in battle, or for herself if she's fighting alone and falls to fewer than 25 hit points before she tries to flee combat.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If reduced to fewer than 25 hit points, Koriah withdraws from combat. She uses her aklys to try to trip foes and deter them from chasing her, but as long as any allies remain in battle, she won't completely abandon a fight.</Morale>

She uses moment of clarity to trigger a wand or scroll if the situation demands, such as in an encounter with a flying or invisible foe.

    <BeforeCombat>The barbarian uses stealth and deception to get close to enemies without them noticing, and uses his chime of opening to break into locked strongholds.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>The barbarian tries to disarm opponents at the beginning of combat, using poison against a target's weakest ability score if he knows his target in advance. He triggers his mighty swing on a sword critical that might slay his target, and uses his rage-enhanced senses to find creatures trying to hide or flee. He uses his buckler when faced with many foes, but against lone targets uses his nine lives stealer for two-handed Power Attacks.</DuringCombat>

    <BeforeCombat>The druid casts endure elements at the start of each day. Before a fight he drinks his potion of invisibility.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Once invisible, the druid moves away from his enemies. He spends the next few rounds casting speak with animals and his extended summon nature's ally spells, followed by magic fang and barkskin, cast from his wands on the summoned creatures. If the summoned creatures take damage, he heals them with his wand of cure moderate wounds. If his invisibility is compromised, he wild shapes into an eagle to keep out of reach.</DuringCombat>

Once at a safe altitude, he casts wind wall and freedom of movement.

If forced into melee, he casts greater magic fang before wild shaping into a Huge animal (preferably a triceratops or an orca).</DuringCombat>

She makes the PCs come to her before engaging in melee&amp;#8211;if the PCs use ranged weapons or attacks, though, she rushes down the stairs to attack them once at least four of the giants below have been killed.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If reduced to fewer than 80 hit points, General Stom makes a fighting retreat toward the exit, hoping to flee the region entirely once she gets out of the building. If no escape is possible, she surrenders if brought below 20 hit points, and offers to aid the PCs in killing Jubbek. She knows the layout of Jubbek's Halls quite well, and can at the very least provide the PCs with a map and lists of guards. She doesn't know about area B11.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Curse of Wrath Jubbek is consumed by the Shard of Wrath's curse. He starts the battle sickened, but this condition vanishes for 1 hour as soon as he reduces a creature to negative hit points. Once he attacks a creature, Jubbek must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be unable to cease attacking that creature until it is killed. Shard of Wrath Jubbek has lashed the Shard of Wrath to the head of his morningstar&amp;#8211;he deals +1 point of fire damage or +1 point of cold damage (the energy type switches each day) on a hit with his morningstar as a result of the shard's siccatite qualities.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Gender>Male</Gender>
    <DuringCombat>Once Jubbek joins the fight, he focuses his anger on the creature that damaged him the most before he got to act. He rages as he fights, and works his way into area B8a. Once there, he takes a standard action to smash his morningstar against the floor, attempting a DC 20 Strength check to knock a 5-foot-diameter hole into the floor. Once he makes a hole, he and the other giants try to move or bull rush PCs into the hole&amp;#8211;it's a 30-foot drop onto rubble below, and the only exit from the area is the hole itself. Jubbek uses the fireball spell-like ability granted him if faced by a group of PCs clustering together for their own defense.</DuringCombat>

    <SpecialAbilities>Rejuvenation (Su) The Curator's remains are located in area C10. In order to lay him to rest, these remains must be brought to the surface and set before the one remaining spire of Guiltspur that protrudes aboveground. This causes the Curator's ghost to manifest amid a swirling vortex of dust over his remains&amp;#8211;he glances around in anguish and despair as he realizes that the time of Thassilon has truly moved on. Within a few seconds, the vortex of air grinds his remains away to dust and his spirit is released to seek its reward or punishment in the afterlife. (Divination or other magical investigation is likely required to discover this method of putting the ghost to rest.) Spell Stealing (Su) Once per round as a free action whenever any of the Curator's spell effects affect a spellcaster, he can attempt to steal one of that spellcaster's prepared spells or unused spell slots. The target can resist this attack with a successful DC 24 Will save. If the save fails, one random prepared spell or unused spell slot of the highest spell level available to the caster is expended for the day as if it had been used, but without any other effect save for healing the Curator damage equal to twice the spell level stolen. The save DC is Charisma-based. Thassilonian Specialization The Curator is a Thassilonian specialist, which allows him to prepare the bonus transmutation spell granted by his school specialization twice rather than once. He treats enchantment and illusion spells as if they were not on the wizard spell list. Further details on this form of school specialization can be found on page 17 of Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Inner Sea Magic.</SpecialAbilities>

    <BeforeCombat>The Curator casts quickened shield and extended mage armor before attacking.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>The Curator casts extended haste and quickened glitterdust on the first round of combat, then follows up by favoring spells that cause lengthy or permanent problems to the PCs rather than attempting to simply hurt them&amp;#8211;he wants to stop the PCs in their tracks with flesh to stone, baleful polymorph, or blindness/ deafness if possible. If a lower-level spell is particularly effective, he uses mnemonic enhancer to recall it. He's also fond of splitting up the party by using spells like hungry pit or wall of fire to control the battlefield, and of forcing the PCs to stumble into new rooms before they might be ready. The Curator knows how all of the dangers in the Silent Halls work, and does his best to try to lure the PCs into those dangers.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>The Curator knows that if he dies, he merely returns in 2d4 days. He fights until destroyed without remorse, but if reduced to fewer than 75 hit points, he knows that he's running out of time in the short term, and at this point does his best to lure the PCs into peril to distract them, preferring to use malevolence in the attempt to possess a PC and then force that PC to go find an untriggered encounter or unsprung trap.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Behead (Ex) A skull ripper is an expert at collecting its favorite trophies: skulls. Once it has pinned a foe, it can attempt to behead the victim with its claws. This attempt is made as part of the grapple check to maintain an existing pin, and if successful, deals 4d6+18 points of damage to the victim. If this damage is enough to bring the foe to fewer than 0 hit points, the victim must succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save to resist having his head torn from his body; failure results in instant death for most creatures. The save DC is Strength-based. Dread Visage (Su) A skull ripper's fearsome appearance is such that all creatures within 30 feet that can see the skull ripper must succeed at a DC 22 Will save at the start of their turn or be frightened for 1 round. If the victim recognizes any of the heads affixed to the skull ripper's body as having once belonged to friends or allies, that victim takes a &amp;#8211;4 penalty on the save. A character that succeeds at the save is immune to the dread visage of that particular skull ripper for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. Poison (Su) Sting&amp;#8211;injury; save Fort DC 18; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Dex; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <DuringCombat>The two skull rippers lurk in the shadows near the north and west doors, attacking as soon as anyone comes within reach. Each focuses on the same foe if possible, moving to flank if there's room. They pursue foes until heavily wounded (see Morale), even up into Jubbek's Halls above.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>A skull ripper retreats to area C1 if reduced to fewer than 50 hit points. Confronted there, a skull ripper fights until destroyed.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Breath of Madness (Su) Ognathooga can exhale a cloud of foul-smelling, narcotic breath as a standard action once every minute. This black smoke fills a 60-foot cone. All creatures in the area take 1d6 points of Wisdom damage and become confused for 1d6 rounds (a successful DC 27 Will save halves the Wisdom damage and negates the confusion effect). This is a mind-affecting poison effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <DuringCombat>Ognathooga starts combat by attempting to dominate one of the PCs while herself remaining hidden mostly underwater. If she manages to dominate the PC, she uses her control to lure the rest of the party any way she can into the waters of the lake, where she then risks losing control of her dominated minion by ordering it to attack its allies. She uses demand and other spell-like abilities to try to scatter the PCs, so that she can then swim in and attack them one at a time. Note that while in the area of effect of the abysium reactor, two of her abilities (transdimensional tentacles and warp dimensions) do not work&amp;#8211;Ognathooga is unlikely to pursue the PCs beyond area D6, but if she does, these abilities (detailed in full on page 406 of Rise of the Runelords Anniversary Edition) function normally.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If brought below 75 hit points, Ognathooga retreats to area D3. If encountered there, she fights to the death.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>The hunt mistress uses levitate to hide amid the stalactites, 20 feet above the ground. She casts barkskin and bear's endurance once she notices the PCs coming toward the beach. She watches the PCs move through the area, and if she's not spotted, she drops down to the ground via feather fall once the PCs move on, then follows them. She only attacks if they attack first.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>The hunt mistress casts gravity bow on the first round of combat, then levitates back down to the ground if necessary. Once on stable ground, she uses her crossbow, Deadly Aim, and Shot on the Run to make a fighting retreat to area D9 to rejoin her kin. When fighting with others, the hunt mistress instead makes full attacks, taking 5-foot steps as necessary to avoid attacks of opportunity.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>The slave collar worn by the hunt mistress ensure that she fights to the death as long as Xaivanshee lives. If Xaivanshee dies, the hunt mistress immediately flees back toward area D8, leaps in, and feather falls back down to Sekamina to return home.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Priestly Shame Even though she abandoned her faith thousands of years ago, Mesmalatu still harbors a hidden reserve of shame. Forcefully presenting any object sacred to Lissala (including anything bearing the image of the Sihedron, but not one of the shards of the Shattered Star) as a standard action causes the demilich to become staggered for 1d4 rounds. She can be staggered in this manner no more than once per day.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Gender>Female</Gender>
    <DuringCombat>Mesmalatu's first action in combat is to attempt to devour the soul of the most dangerous looking target&amp;#8211;if the possessed nalfeshnee from area E6 is with the party, she targets it with this ability in preference to the PCs. On the second round, she uses wail of the banshee. On the third round, she casts her most devastating spell. She repeats this pattern, periodically augmenting it with inflict wounds spells to heal herself. If she's targeted by holy smite or shatter, Mesmalatu's next action is to cast spell immunity to make herself immune to these spells.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Mesmalatu fights until destroyed.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Contingency If Cadrilkasta is reduced to 150 hit points or fewer, greater invisibility activates on her. Curse of Sloth Cadrilkasta is under the curse of sloth from the Shard of Sloth she carries (Pathfinder #61 69).</SpecialAbilities>
    <Gender>Female</Gender>
    <BeforeCombat>Cadrilkasta casts endure elements every day.</BeforeCombat>
    <Morale>During Combat Although Cadrilkasta is a dangerous foe, the curse that afflicts her helps to soften that danger somewhat. She doesn't bother casting many preparatory spells before combat, and for the first few rounds of battle she doesn't bother taking more than a move action, and stays in her nest. She clutches the Shard of Sloth tightly in one claw at all times, which prevents her from making a second claw attack even when she does start making full attacks. At the start of combat, Cadrilkasta activates her storm breath ability, calling down a bolt of lightning on the closest foe. She continues calling down bolts each round until she's reduced to fewer than 250 hit points. At this point, she realizes she's up against significant foes. She then leaps into the air and starts taking her full complement of actions (at which point her curse makes her sickened). She prefers not to make full attacks, and instead swoops back and forth while casting spells or breathing lightning on the PCs. She also starts using Quicken Spell to cast additional spells each round&amp;#8211;displacement on the first round, followed by glitterdust, scorching ray, magic missile, grease, and reduce person. She saves a 7th-level spell slot for summon monster VII, three 5th-level spell slots for her teleport spells, and at least two 4th-level slots for charm monster spells to be used as detailed in her section if she flees. Once she's reduced to fewer than 150 hit points, her contingency spell activates, turning her invisible. She then casts teleport to retreat to area F3, where she casts summon monster VII to summon 1d3 lillend azatas, then orders them to heal her with cure serious wounds and cure light wounds. Once they exhaust their healing, she uses her mirage ability to create a duplicate image of herself farther up the tunnel, making it appear that she's come back to cast more spells and breathe more lightning at foes while her lillends move up to attack the PCs as well. As soon as her mirage ends or the PCs confront her in F3, she lands in their midst and starts making full attacks (still minus one claw attack). Cadrilkasta tries to escape if reduced to 60 hit points or fewer, taking with her only the treasures she carries or wears and leaving the rest behind in area F10. She casts teleport to return to area F1, then flees through the portal back to area E3 in the Embassy of Leng (she doesn't realize she can do the same by fleeing into the clouds below). The dragon makes her way back through the dungeons&amp;#8211;pausing to breathe a bolt of lightning into the pit at area E3 to wake up and anger the bhole so that pursuing PCs need to deal with it (unless they've already damaged the bhole enough to make it retreat for an extended time). As she works her way back up through the dungeon, Cadrilkasta uses charm monster to recruit additional creatures to slow down her pursuers. Once she exits the dungeon (or immediately upon returning to the Material Plane if the abysium reactor is no longer functioning), she uses teleport to escape into an old lair in the Kodar Mountains.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Demonic Obedience This feat grants Xaivanshee vampiric touch as a spell-like ability and a +4 profane bonus on saving throws against the supernatural abilities of undead. In order to maintain Zura's Favor and the other effects of the feat, every day while she prepares her spells Xaivanshee must drink the blood of a willing creature while allowing that creature to drink some of her own blood. Profane Gift (Su) Xaivanshee has a +2 profane bonus to her Constitution&amp;#8211;a profane gift from the succubus Liluresha, who serves the demon lord Zura. Zura's Favor (Su) Xaivanshee currently enjoys the favor of her patron demon lord, Zura. As a result, her cloak of chaos spell lasts for 24 hours when cast, and she gains fast healing 10. If she ever loses Zura's favor or fails to perform her Demonic Obedience, she loses these benefits forever, takes 2d6 points of Wisdom drain, and gains 2d4 permanent negative levels.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Gender>Female</Gender>
    <BeforeCombat>Xaivanshee uses her extend metamagic rod to cast an extended heroes' feast for herself and her allies every day. She also casts magic vestment on her armor and greater magic weapon on both rapiers, then casts cloak of chaos on herself (this lasts for 24 hours due to her favor with her deity). If she knows she's about to enter combat, she casts air walk and freedom of movement.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Xaivanshee hangs back in combat, letting her allies occupy foes in melee as long as possible. Her first act in the battle is to cast rift of ruin to open a chasm under the feet of any enemies standing on the ground. On the second round, she causes the rift to close by summoning a bebilith through it to fight alongside her. (If you don't have access to rift of ruin, replace this spell with summon monster VIII.) Xaivanshee uses her ranged attack spells in following rounds. If she sees her allies have become wounded, she moves in to aid them with healing spells. She's well aware that the longer they live, the longer they can protect her. She enters melee combat if she has to, but tries to cast divine favor beforehand. She saves heal to cast on herself once she's reduced to 50 hit points or fewer.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Xaivanshee goes to any lengths to remain alive if faced with certain defeat, taking hostages to bargain for escape, fleeing in outright cowardice, offering bribes, or begging for mercy (in that order of preference).</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Mind-Warping Gaze (Su) See page 194 of Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2. Obliteration Ray (Su) As a swift action, a mothman elder can fire a ray of devastating energy as a ranged touch attack that deals 8d6 points of damage (or 8d8 points of damage against an object, automatically bypassing hardness). This attack deals either acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage, as chosen by the mothman elder at the start of its turn. This attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment. Warp Elements (Su) A mothman elder's presence distorts the perceptions of those around it, to the point that they believe it is either suddenly swelteringly hot or numbingly cold. Any creature that starts its turn within 120 feet of a mothman elder must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or immediately succumb to the effects of extreme heat (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 444) or extreme cold (Core Rulebook 442). A mothman elder can switch between emitting a hot or cold aura as a move action. This effect lasts as long as the target remains within the area of effect and for 1d6 minutes afterward. A target may attempt a new Will save every minute to prematurely end the effect. This is a mind-affecting effect&amp;#8211;the heat and cold are not real, and thus energy resistance and spells like endure elements have no effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>

    <DuringCombat>If he can control an opening such as a doorway, the monk does his best not to move or let others past. He uses Vital Strike whenever he cannot use flurry of blows.

He trips those adjacent to him so he can make attacks of opportunity when they stand up from prone. Against a single opponent, the steadfast defender uses his ki pool to add extra attacks to his flurry of blows; against multiple opponents he uses it to improve his Armor Class.</DuringCombat>

    <DuringCombat>The monk trusts his improved evasion, high saves, and spell resistance to safeguard him against spellcasters, and focuses on martial opponents, combining Spring Attack and Stunning Fist. He uses Lunge against Small or Medium opponents, often using ki points to grant himself a bonus to AC and negate the penalty from using Lunge. When making a flurry of blows, he attempts a Stunning Fist on the first strike. He uses Snatch Arrows to return thrown weapons and Deadly Aim whenever he catches a weapon he is proficient with.</DuringCombat>

    <DuringCombat>This monk prefers to use improvised weapons like ladders, tankards, and chisels. If he happens upon a particularly effective and sturdy improvised weapon, he applies oil of greater magic weapon before rejoining the fray.

    <BeforeCombat>The monk drinks his potions of barkskin and protection from energy (fire) if he has had time to study his foes' weaknesses. When fighting in cramped or narrow areas, he instead drinks his potion of invisibility and coats an area of the floor with his salve of slipperiness. He then waits for foes to enter the greased area before attacking.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>The monk uses his kama in conjunction with Spring Attack and Improved Trip to knock foes prone, potentially using the kama's ki focus special ability to channel his Stunning Fist. If he has successfully tripped foes with his salve of slipperiness, he activates his slippers of spider climbing so he doesn't have to cross the slippery floor, and uses flurry of blows with his shuriken. If outnumbered, he uses his elemental gem and flanks with the earth elemental.</DuringCombat>

    <BeforeCombat>The monk drinks his potions of barkskin and bear's endurance.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>The monk expends a point from his ki pool at the beginning of combat to increase his speed. He then closes with a single opponent to deliver an Improved Vital Strike combined with Stunning Fist. If successful, he makes a full attack with his flurry of blows in the next round, attempting to finish the hampered opponent. He uses this tactic whenever possible, using flurry of blows or Power Attack only against targets that have already had their AC compromised from being stunned or tripped. Otherwise, he uses his mobility and high Acrobatics skill to move in and out of melee. When fighting four or more opponents, the monk activates his feather token (whip) and targets spellcasters first with Stunning Fist combined with Medusa's Wrath.</DuringCombat>

    <SpecialAbilities>Fear of Fire (Ex) A shriezyx within 30 feet of a fire the size of a torch or larger becomes shaken as long as it remains within that range. If damaged by fire, a shriezyx must succeed at a Will save (DC equals the amount of fire damage dealt) or be frightened for 1 round. Poison (Ex) Bite&amp;#8211;injury; save Fort DC 27; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Str; cure 2 consecutive saves. Slowing Toxin (Su) Any creature struck by this enormous shriezyx's web must succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save or be slowed (as per the spell) for 1 minute. Each round, a victim may attempt a new DC 27 Fortitude save to end the effect early. This toxin fades quickly from spun webs&amp;#8211;it can only affect targets on the round the web is spun. Existing webs, while they remain sticky, do not have this slowing effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <DuringCombat>The shriezyx uses its web to entrap foes who aren't wearing armor&amp;#8211;it's smart enough to assume these characters aren't as strong as armor-wearing foes. It prefers to focus its attacks on armor-clad foes so its poison can debilitate their strength.</DuringCombat>

    <DuringCombat>If threatened, or if a PC attempts to open the throne room portal, the axiomites shift to their crystalline dust forms as a free action and cast mage armor on the first round of combat. On the next round, two of them revert to solid form to flank the PC who tried to open the door and attack with their swords while the third stays in dust form and uses spell-like abilities. An axiomite that is brought below 100 hit points reverts to dust form to enjoy the protective effects of incorporeality, replaced in combat by the third, who assumes solid form while the wounded one regenerates and casts spells.</DuringCombat>

    <SpecialAbilities>Rune-Carved Xin's legionnaires have been enhanced by the rune-carved construct modification (see Ultimate Magic). The rune of shielding grants a +4 shield bonus to the construct's AC for 3 minutes, and activates automatically as soon as it is attacked with a melee attack, ranged attack, or magic missile (this shield bonus is included in the stats above). The rune of fire releases a 5-foot-radius burst of fire dealing 3d8 points of fire damage to all creatures within the burst (Reflex DC 12 half ).</SpecialAbilities>

    <SpecialAbilities>Absorb Body (Su) A corpse orgy can absorb the physical body of any creature it has reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by moving over it and remaining in contact with it for at least 1 full round. An unconscious or dying opponent who succeeds at a DC 29 Fortitude save evades absorption; otherwise, the victim dies upon being absorbed. A dead opponent gets no saving throw. When the corpse orgy absorbs a body, it gains 12 temporary hit points. A creature whose body is absorbed can only be raised or resurrected if the corpse orgy that absorbed its body is slain and the corpse in question is recovered. The save DC is Constitution-based. Pain Shriek (Su) Twice per day, as a standard action, the homunculus mass can unleash a piercing shriek that deals 10d6 points of sonic damage to all creatures within a 40-foot-radius burst (Fortitude DC 25 half ). This is a sonic effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. Poison (Ex) Slam&amp;#8211;injury; save Fort DC 29; frequency 1/minute for 6 minutes; effect sleep for 1 minute; cure 1 save. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <DuringCombat>The homunculus mass prefers to attack one target, focusing its attacks there in an attempt to absorb a body. It pursues foes throughout the complex, but if confronted by a construct, it favors attacks against its creator's minions over the PCs.</DuringCombat>

    <SpecialAbilities>Crystalline Claws (Ex) A crystallis's claws overcome damage reduction and hardness as if they were adamantine, but crumble to powder if removed or upon the creature's death. Immunity to Earth (Ex) A crystallis is immune to natural attacks and supernatural abilities from creatures of the earth subtype, and to all spells with the earth descriptor. They are also immune to disintegration effects. Petrification Cloud (Su) Once every 1d4+1 rounds, a crystallis can breathe forth a cloud of orange smoke as a free action. This cloud fills a 10-foot cube adjacent to the crystallis and lasts for 1 round before dispersing. A living creature that enters the cloud must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude save or be petrified, transforming into a crystalline statue. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <DuringCombat>Both elder crystallises breath out petrification clouds on the first round, trying to catch as many enemies within as they can, then breathe again as often as they can. They prefer to focus attacks on the same foe, starting with the strongest-looking characters first since they know spellcasters will have problems with the noqual in the walls.</DuringCombat>

    <SpecialAbilities>Abysium Pulse (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds as a free action, the two adamantine spheres atop the clockwork reliquary's body can bloom like metal flowers to reveal highly refined abysium rods that immediately pulse with energy. All creatures within a 30-foot-radius spread must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or suffer 1d6 points of Constitution drain and become nauseated for 1 round. On a successful save, creatures in the area suffer only 1 point of Constitution drain and are staggered for 1 round. The reliquary cannot create an abysium pulse in the same round it lashes out with its djezet blood. This is a poison effect. The save DC is Constitution-based. Alloyed Claws (Ex) The clockwork reliquary's claws are crafted from a strange alloy of adamantine and siccatite. These claws threaten a critical hit on a result of 19&amp;#8211;20 and deal x4 damage on a successful critical hit. They always add 1-1/2 times the reliquary's Strength modifier on damage rolls. The claws bypass hardness and damage reduction as if they were made of adamantine, and on a hit, the reliquary can decide to deal +1d6 points of fire damage or +1d6 points of cold damage as a free action. Conquer Construct (Su) As a standard action, the clockwork reliquary can target a single mindless construct within 120 feet and attempt to seize control of it. The construct can attempt to resist this control with a DC 33 Will save, but on a failure, it permanently falls under the clockwork reliquary's command. If the reliquary targets a dormant construct (such as an unwound clockwork, or any of the dormant constructs on the risen island of Xin), the construct fails the save automatically and is immediately activated at the start of the next round. The save DC is Charisma-based. Djezet Blood (Su) The clockwork reliquary's "blood" is composed of djezet. Once every 1d4 rounds as a free action, the reliquary may lash out at a single creature within 30 feet with a tendril of this blood. The reliquary must attempt a +36 touch attack; if it hits, the target must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or become more susceptible to the reliquary's supernatural attacks and spell-like abilities, taking a &amp;#8211;10 penalty on all saving throws against these attacks for 24 hours. The reliquary cannot use its blood in this way during the same round it creates an abysium pulse. The save DC is Constitution-based. Haunted (Ex) The reliquary gains its Charisma bonus (+11) to its AC as a deflection bonus and on Fortitude saves as a resistance bonus. It gains its Charisma bonus (+11) to each of its Hit Dice as bonus hit points. Inubrix Darts (Ex) As a full-round action, the clockwork reliquary may fire six inubrix darts from its upper body, or one dart as a standard action. These darts have a range increment of 90 feet and ignore any armor or shield bonus granted by metal armor or shields. The reliquary can fire 100 darts before it must craft replacements. Sihedron Vulnerability (Ex) A creature equipped with the Sihedron can penetrate the clockwork reliquary's damage reduction with any attack, and automatically succeeds at all checks to penetrate its spell resistance. If the Sihedron's user transfers the Sihedron to an ally while the clockwork reliquary is within 30 feet, the reliquary must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save or be staggered for 1 round. Skymetal Plating (Su) Plates of horacalcum and noqual are incorporated into the reliquary's body. These plates rotate and realign every round so that one of the two materials is visible, while the other side of the plate faces inward. On even-numbered rounds, its horacalcum plates are visible and the clockwork reliquary functions as if hasted. On odd-numbered rounds, its noqual plates are visible and its spell resistance increases to 37. Susceptible to Positive Energy (Ex) The reliquary is vulnerable to damage from positive energy as if it were an undead creature. It is not affected by negative energy. Unstable Mind (Ex) The clockwork reliquary's animating spirit carries with it all of Xin's madness. At the start of every round, there's a cumulative 1% chance that it malfunctions in that round&amp;#8211;if the reliquary malfunctions, it functions for that round as if confused. Presenting evidence of Xin's failure (such as a portion of the homunculus mass&amp;#8211;other elements may work at your discretion) increases the next malfunction check by 20%. Once the reliquary malfunctions, the malfunction chance resets to 1% for the next round.</SpecialAbilities>
    <DuringCombat>The clockwork reliquary lashes at the closest target with its djezet blood on the 1st round of combat, then triggers its abysium pulse in the 2nd round. It uses these abilities as often as it can. The construct uses telekinesis to try to wrench the Sihedron away from its controller (treat this as a disarm combat maneuver, but grant the defender a +10 bonus to its CMD), mixing melee and ranged attacks as appropriate in a round (it prefers attacking with its claws). If reduced to fewer than 150 hit points, it casts repulsion and uses chain lightning to keep foes at range while using its fast healing. On the fifth round of combat, the reliquary attempts to use mage's disjunction to destroy the Sihedron. It has a 20% chance to affect the artifact, at which point the item's controller can attempt to resist the effect with a DC 29 Will save made at a &amp;#8211;5 penalty. If the clockwork reliquary is successful, it must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or immediately and permanently lose its spell resistance, fast healing, damage reduction, and all of its spell-like abilities and supernatural special abilities. If it succeeds at this save, the loss of these abilities is only temporary, lasting for 5 rounds.</DuringCombat>

    <SpecialAbilities>Consume Memory (Su) When Ogonthunn bites a creature, it consumes memories. The creature bitten must succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save or gain 1 negative level. Ogonthunn heals 5 points of damage each time it grants a negative level in this way, and also learns some of the target creature's memories (subject to the GM's discretion). This is a mind-affecting effect. Ogonthunn can suppress this ability as a free action. The save DC is Charisma-based. Delayed Suggestion (Sp) Whenever Ogonthunn successfully uses dominate person or dominate monster on a creature, it can implant a delayed suggestion that triggers when the dominate effect ends. This suggestion (which functions as a spell-like ability, CL 20th, Will DC 22 negates) is for the creature to put its gear somewhere safe and then spend the next 20 hours attempting to track down Ogonthunn and present itself to the veiled master to be re-dominated. Mucus Cloud (Ex) While underwater, Ogonthunn exudes a cloud of transparent slime in a 30-foot-radius spread. Every creature in this area must succeed at a DC 29 Fortitude save each round or lose the ability to breathe air (but gain the ability to breathe water) for 24 hours. Renewed contact with this mucus cloud and failing another save extends the effect for another 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based. Runemastery (Ex) Ogonthunn is particularly skilled at casting spells that create magical writing, such as explosive runes, secret page, or any spell with the word "symbol" in its name. It never requires material components or focus components when casting such spells, and the save DC of any of these spells increases by 1. Ogonthunn's symbol spells are difficult to disarm&amp;#8211;the Disable Device DC for these symbols increases by 2. Slime (Ex) A creature hit by Ogonthunn's bite or claw attacks must succeed at a DC 29 Fortitude save or its skin and flesh transform into a clear, slimy membrane over the course of 1d4 rounds. The creature's new "flesh" is soft and tender, reducing its Constitution score by 4 as long as the condition persists. If the creature's flesh isn't kept moist, it dries quickly and the victim takes 1d12 points of damage every 10 minutes. Remove disease and similar effects can restore an afflicted creature to normal, but immunity to disease offers no protection from this attack. The save DC is Constitution-based. Spells Ogonthunn can cast spells as a 17th-level sorcerer. Swift Transformation (Su) Ogonthunn can use its change shape ability as a swift action. Thoughtlance (Su) Four of Ogonthunn's tentacles end in glowing spheres of light. These spheres deal 2d6 points of electricity damage on a successful touch attack, and also blast the targeted creature's mind with waves of mental energy&amp;#8211;a creature touched by one of these tentacles (regardless of whether the touch deals electricity damage) must succeed at a DC 27 Will save or be staggered for 1 round. Additional touches increase the duration by 1 round. While a creature is staggered in this manner, it must attempt concentration checks to cast spells as if it were experiencing extremely violent motion while casting (DC = 20 + spell level). The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <BeforeCombat>Ogonthunn casts extended false life every day. If the veiled master suspects it will be confronting foes, it places symbols on the walls of its lair. If it wishes to capture victims alive to interrogate them (as is the case the first time it notices the PCs are drawing near), it uses a symbol of weakness, a symbol of persuasion, and a symbol of pain. If it wishes to destroy intruders (as is the case if the PCs return at a later point after fleeing a battle), it uses a symbol of death, a symbol of insanity, and a symbol of stunning.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>If possible, Ogonthunn begins combat from hiding, casting combat spells through a projected image. It casts mind fog first, followed in subsequent rounds by dominate monster and dominate person attacks. Foes that seem difficult to dominate are instead targeted with phantasmal killers, chain lightning, magic missiles, and rays of enfeeblement, often enhanced via metamagic. Since so many of its spells rely on sight, Ogonthunn prefers to save blindness/deafness for particularly frustrating foes who find ways to avoid being dominated or succumbing to symbols. When facing foes in melee, Ogonthunn uses Arcane Strike to gain a +4 bonus on attack damage rolls, unless it is brought below 120 hit points, in which case it augments its attacks with quickened vampiric touch.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If reduced to fewer than 50 hit points, Ogonthunn uses teleport to flee (using mislead to escape in the short term if it must relocate physically to a location where teleportation works). After 24 hours, it returns to Xin, fully healed, to seek revenge.</Morale>

These spirits provide a +4 deflection bonus to AC, immunity to enchantment and illusion spells, and one of the following spell effects: bless, endure elements, protection from evil, protection from good, or see invisibility. The effects of a spirit summoning persist for 24 hours. Thassilonian Specialization Thulos is a Thassilonian specialist, which allows him to prepare the bonus transmutation spell granted by his school specialization twice rather than once. He treats abjuration and enchantment spells as if they were not on the wizard spell list.

    <SpecialAbilities>Cold Flesh (Ex) A winter witch gains endure elements as a constant, spell-like ability, but only against cold temperatures. At 4th level, she gains cold resistance 5, making her comfortable in near-freezing temperatures. This replaces the witch's 4th-level hex. Freeze and Thaw (Su) At 2nd level, a winter witch can freeze water or melt ice and snow with a touch. As a standard action, a winter witch can melt an adjacent 5-foot cube of ice or 10-foot cube of snow. Melting snow produces a volume of water equal to 10% the snow's volume. Alternatively, a winter witch can freeze 5 cubic feet of water into solid ice. This freezing takes place gradually over 1 round, making it almost impossible to trap a creature unless it's helpless. This ability cannot affect water within a creature. One cubic foot of ice contains roughly 8 gallons of water and weighs about 60 pounds. This ability works on fresh water and saltwater, but has no affect on water creatures; on liquids (frozen or otherwise) other than water; or on magical water, ice, or snow. A winter witch can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 her class level. Hyperboreal Patronage A winter witch's patron reveals an icy aspect. A winter witch adds the following spells to her spell list at the following class levels, but does not automatically learn them: 3rd&amp;#8211;wall of ice, 5th&amp;#8211;icy prisonUM, 7th&amp;#8211;freezing sphere. Ice Magic When a winter witch casts a spell with the cold descriptor, the save DC of the spell increases by 1. A winter witch cannot learn or cast spells with the fire descriptor. Sculpt Ice and Snow (Sp) At 4th level, a winter witch can sculpt ice and snow into any shape that suits her purpose (as stone shape, except that it works with ice). This ability also works on snow, doubling the volume affected. At 7th level, this ability functions on ice or snow like the fabricate spell, increasing the volume manipulated and allowing a higher degree of craftsmanship. The winter witch must succeed at appropriate Craft checks to form complex items or ones with fine detail. Items created by the fabricate version of this ability solidify into ultra-hard ice (hardness 5, 10 hit points per inch of thickness) that resists normal melting but takes double damage from fire. The ice remains in this ultra-hard state for 1 hour per class level before returning to normal ice. A winter witch can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1/2 her class level. Unnatural Cold (Su) At 3rd level, whenever a winter witch's spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability deals cold damage, treat affected creatures as having half their normal cold resistance when determining damage dealt. Winter Witchcraft Levels of the winter witch prestige class stack with witch levels for determining when the winter witch learns new hexes, the effect of her hexes and other witch class abilities (including archetype abilities), the abilities of her witch's familiar, and the level at which she can select major hexes or grand hexes.</SpecialAbilities>

Depending on the style and theme of the match, he may go for blood with his sword and mace, hold the high ground with his trident, or capture and drag his opponent with the net. Outside the arena, he is quick and brutal with his attacks, wasting no time before killing his opponent so he is out of danger as soon as possible.</DuringCombat>

    <DuringCombat>Amiri counts on her high Strength and the sheer size of her blade to defeat foes, knowing that her attacks are less accurate because of the sword's size. When she has difficulty hitting a target, needs to deal even more damage, or needs the extra boost to her Constitution, Amiri rages and uses Power Attack to bring enemies to their knees.

    <DuringCombat>Seelah is fearless, especially in the face of evil, and she faces fiends, undead, and those with malicious intent head-on. Against particularly powerful evil foes&amp;#8211;especially fiends and evil dragons&amp;#8211;she channels her goddess's power into her attacks with her smite evil ability. If she has already expended her daily uses of smite evil, she uses her divine bond to increase her weapon's power. When her allies are injured or in trouble, Seelah puts herself in harm's way in an effort to heal them.</DuringCombat>

    <DuringCombat>Initially, the sprites snipe at the PCs while hiding in the trees. After firing, they can attempt another Stealth check at a &amp;#8211;20 penalty to stay hidden. If anyone closes on their position, the sprites forgo further attacks until they can silently relocate to another tree. Any sprite spotted by the PCs fights defensively to protect itself, drawing the PCs' attention so its companions can sneak up behind the PCs and catch their enemies in a color spray. They take turns with this tactic to blind, stun, and knock out as many targets as possible, then rain arrows infused with numbing cold on those who remain.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If the sprites are faced with fire-based attacks or the PCs manage to slay the majority of them, the remaining sprites flee, seeking out Fawfein (at area E) or Izoze (at area H4) for protection. They cast dancing lights once more to mask their retreat, sending the lights in different directions as they dim their own luminosity in the hope of leading pursuers astray.</Morale>

    <DuringCombat>If able to prepare an ambush, the bandits fire on the most heavily armored opponents first, hoping to wound them before engaging in melee. Thereafter, they drop their bows, draw their swords, and charge.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If overmatched or caught by surprise, the bandits withdraw, believing the Taldan authorities have come to avenge Lady Argentea's abduction. Fighting defensively, they separate to put distance between themselves, covering each other with their bows, while they try to make it back to the lodge to warn the bandits of the PCs' presence. If pinned down (or flanked), they draw their swords and fight.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>If alerted to the PCs' presence in the lodge, Rohkar casts deathwatch, invisibility, and magic weapon. He also applies greenblood oil to his short sword.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Rohkar invisibly exits the room when the PCs arrive, squeezing past anyone at the door while his frost skeletons occupy them. If he finds any bandits unconscious or dying, Rohkar slays them with death knell to further empower himself, then uses his scroll of animate dead to create zombies from their bodies. Upon returning, he directs the undead while channeling negative energy to heal them. If faced with a cleric channeling positive energy, he counters with cause fear and his poisoned blade, activating his copycat ability to confuse anyone striking back.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Rohkar lives to kill in the name of Norgorber, but has no desire to die himself. If reduced to 5 hit points or fewer, he throws down his weapon and feigns remorse, blaming everything on Izoze and Teb Knotten (see Development, below).</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Doll's Dagger (Su) The dagger wielded by a guardian doll is treated as a masterwork weapon and deals 1d6 points of cold damage in addition to its normal damage. Those struck by the dagger must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or be paralyzed by the supernatural cold of the weapon for 1d4 rounds. If the guardian doll is destroyed, its weapon becomes a useless child's toy. The save DC is Charisma-based. Soul Focus (Su) Thora's soul is bound within the doll's gemstone eye. As long as this soul focus remains intact, it can be used to animate another doll, using the same cost as creating a new construct. Once bound into the soul focus, the soul continues to learn. If it is put into a new doll body, the soul retains its personality and memories from its previous bodies. A soul focus has hardness 8, 12 hit points, and a break DC of 20. Susceptible to Mind-Affecting Effects (Ex) Like a soulbound doll, a guardian doll is susceptible to mind-affecting effects. However, because of the singular purpose with which it is imbued, its saves against such effects are made with a +1 racial bonus.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Gender>Female</Gender>
    <DuringCombat>Thora casts levitate to rise into the air so she can more safely cast spells, using charm person to create allies to prevent others from attacking her. If forced into melee combat, she casts frostfall and then attacks with her doll's dagger, hoping to catch paralyzed opponents in the supernaturally chilled area of the spell.</DuringCombat>

    <BeforeCombat>If he has time to prepare, Hommelstaub uses his scroll of resist energy and casts magic stone on three pebbles to hurl with his sling.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Hommelstaub turns invisible and flies upward to hide in the falling snow, where his snow sight grants him a superior view of the camp. He then throws a thunderstone, smashing it against an armored enemy or the side of an igloo to deafen his opponents and warn Teb Knotten and his sprite allies (see Development, below). Hommelstaub hurls bottles of liquid ice to snuff out any enemy fire sources, and casts summon monster I to summon fiendish eagles to attack opponents while he uses his sling. If drawn into melee combat, Hommelstaub casts reduce person on his attackers before making sneak attacks with inflict light wounds or his wintry touch.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If reduced to fewer than 15 hit points, Hommelstaub retreats back into the falling snow to drink his potion of cure moderate wounds. Thereafter, he fights to the death, though if Teb Knotten is dead, he might try to flee through the winter portal back to Irrisen instead.</Morale>

Against heavily armored opponents, he switches to single attacks with his longsword instead, pausing only to drink a potion of cure light wounds to keep going.</DuringCombat>

If faced with a formidable foe, she changes strategy and uses her Shield of Swings feat to increase her AC.

    <BeforeCombat>Unlike many of the Pale Tower's inhabitants, Jairess has trouble weathering the cold, so she casts endure elements on herself every day.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Jairess directs her ravens to swarm opponents on the first round of battle while she drinks her potion of fly (increasing her Fly skill to +12) and rises into the air. She then casts wind wall to defend against ranged attacks, followed by spells such as hold person and sound burst to keep enemies from avoiding the raven swarm. If she must fight, Jairess casts returning weapon from her scroll on her shortspear. If she or the ravens become significantly injured, she casts obscuring mist and channels positive energy, excluding nearby adversaries with her Selective Channeling feat.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Once she exhausts her offensive spells and healing powers, Jairess surrenders, calling her surviving birds back to her. If the raven swarm is slain, Jairess avenges them by fighting to the death.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Exceptional Resources (Ex) As Nazhena Vasilliovna's apprentice, Radosek has access to all of the resources of the Pale Tower, granting him the same wealth as a PC. This increases his CR by 1.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Gender>Male</Gender>
    <BeforeCombat>Radosek always casts false life and mage armor before battle.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Radosek casts summon monster III on the first round of combat, using the cauldron of overwhelming allies in area Q20 to summon 2d3 Small ice elementals to surround and protect himself. He then uses his flight hex to levitate or fly above the fray, conjuring ice spears with his icicle wand or casting blindness/deafness on anyone targeting him with ranged attacks or spells. Thereafter, Radosek resorts to his touch spells, spending a swift action to infuse them with his frozen caress hex, either delivering hexes himself or relying on his familiar, Valstoi, to do so.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If reduced to 15 or fewer hit points, Radosek flees, either through the room's windows using his flight hex, or into area Q23 to use the ice crystal teleporter. In either case, he retreats to the courtyard (area Q2), where he rallies any remaining defenders in the Pale Tower (see Development on page 45). Thereafter, Radosek fights to the death.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Alchemical Enhancements (Ex) The tubes installed into Snarltongue's head grant him several exceptional powers. The purple tube contains a fluid that allows Snarltongue to become invisible as per the spell for up to 10 rounds per day. These rounds do not have to be consecutive. Using this ability is a move action. The green tube contains a liquid that gives Snarltongue fast healing 2. This ability is always active. When he uses rounds of rage, the fluid in the red tube begins to drain (this fluid does not grant him any additional rage powers or rounds of rage).</SpecialAbilities>

    <BeforeCombat>If the PCs venture through the gallery up above, Snarltongue merely observes them from the shadows under the table, which grant him a +4 circumstance bonus on his Stealth check. If the PCs find their way down, he uses his ability to turn invisible and closes in to attack, using his dire rats to distract the rest of the party.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Snarltongue closes with his enemies before becoming visible and flying into a rage. He attacks with reckless abandon and, given the chance, tosses alchemist's fire at spellcasters to distract them from casting spells.</DuringCombat>

    <SpecialAbilities>Deceptive (Ex) A mi-go is a master of deception, and gains a +4 racial bonus on Bluff and Disguise checks. Bluff and Disguise are always class skills for mi-go. Evisceration (Ex) A mi-go's claws are capable of swiftly and painfully performing surgical operations upon helpless creatures or creatures it has grappled. When a mi-go succeeds at a grapple check (in addition to any other effects caused by a successful check), it deals its sneak attack damage to the victim. A creature that takes this damage must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or take an additional 1d4 points of ability damage from the invasive surgery (the type of ability damage dealt is chosen by the mi-go at the time the evisceration occurs). The save DC is Dexterity-based. Item Creation (Ex) All mi-go possess the ability to create strange items that blur the line between magic and technology, given time and resources. But this mi-go doesn't have time to take advantage of this ability during this adventure. Starflight (Su) A mi-go can survive in the void of outer space, and flies through space at an incredible speed. Although exact travel times vary, a trip within a single solar system normally takes 3d20 months, while a trip beyond should take 3d20 years (or more, at the GM's discretion)&amp;#8211;provided the mi-go knows the way to its destination.</SpecialAbilities>
    <DuringCombat>The Visitant starts combat by using its wand of invisibility (via Use Magic Device). It then proceeds to use its summon monster scrolls. Once it has summoned several allies, it casts protection from law and moves to a flanking position&amp;#8211;PCs with healing capacities are its preferred targets.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If reduced to fewer than 30 hit points, the Visitant attempts to flee, making for area C14 so it can escape into the woods to the north. If it manages to do so, it can become a harrowing recurring villain.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Magic Immunities (Su) Kassen's golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. A magical attack that deals fire damage functions normally, dealing twice the normal amount of damage, regardless of whether or not the saving throw is successful. A magical attack that specifically targets wooden objects (such as warp wood) causes Kassen's golem to become staggered for 3 rounds, with no saving throw allowed.</SpecialAbilities>

    <SpecialAbilities>Adhesive Tongue (Ex) A giant frog's tongue has a 15-foot reach. The tongue deals no damage on a hit, but can be used to grab the target&amp;#8211;the adhesive qualities of the tongue grant a giant frog a +4 racial bonus on CMB checks made to grab a target with its tongue. If it grabs a foe, it can pull that target. A giant frog's tongue may be attacked and has AC 15. Damage inflicted to the tongue is deducted from the frog's hit points as normal. If the tongue takes any amount of piercing or slashing damage, the frog drops whatever it has grabbed with its tongue and cannot use its tongue attack again until it heals to its full hit points. Pull (Ex) The frog can make a free combat maneuver check with a successful tongue attack. If successful, the tongue pulls the frog's opponent 5 feet closer to the frog. This ability only works on Medium or smaller creatures. Opponents pulled in this way do not provoke attacks of opportunity and stop if the pull would move them into a solid object or creature. Swallow Whole (Ex) If a frog begins its turn with an opponent grappled in its mouth, it can attempt a new combat maneuver check (as though attempting to pin the opponent). If it succeeds, it swallows its prey, and the opponent takes bite damage. The opponent can be up to one size category smaller than the frog. Being swallowed causes a creature to take damage each round (see above). A swallowed creature keeps the grappled condition, while the creature that did the swallowing does not. A swallowed creature can try to cut its way free with any light slashing or piercing weapon (by dealing the creature 2 hit points of damage), or it can just try to escape the grapple. The frog's interior Armor Class is 10. If a swallowed creature cuts its way out, the frog cannot use swallow whole again until thedamage is healed. If the swallowed creature escapes the grapple, success puts it back in the frog mouth, where it may be bitten or swallowed again.</SpecialAbilities>

    <SpecialAbilities>Death Burst (Ex) When a plague zombie dies, it explodes in a burst of rotting, infected flesh. All creatures adjacent to the plague zombie are exposed to its plague (just as if they had been struck by its slam attack) and must make a Fortitude save or contract zombie rot. Disease (Su) A plague zombie's slam attack carries the zombie rot disease. Zombie rot: slam; save Fort DC 11; onset 1d4 days; frequency 1/day; effect 1d2 Con, this damage cannot be healed while the creature is infected; cure 2 consecutive saves. Anyone who dies while infected with the rotting plague rises as a plague zombie in 2d6 hours. Staggered (Ex) Plague zombies have poor reflexes and can only perform a single move action or standard action each round (so they could move or attack but not both). As a charge action, a zombie can move up to its speed and still make an attack in the same round.</SpecialAbilities>

Wounding (Ex) Any living creature damaged by a bat swarm continues to bleed, losing 1 hit point per round thereafter. Multiple wounds do not result in cumulative bleeding loss. The bleeding can be stopped by a DC 10 Heal check or the application of a cure spell or some other healing magic.</SpecialAbilities>

    <Morale>Yarresh would rather live and seek revenge than die at the hands of surface-dwellers. If brought below 20 hit points, he flees to the northeast... though he may return later and skulk about the city, possibly running into the PCs at an inopportune time.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>Myre is paranoid and casts false life and mage armor if he doesn't already have them active. His current hit points include 12 points from false life.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Myre lets his zombies do the work for him, hanging back to attack foes from range with his spells after pulling aside his leather curtain to allow him line of sight into area B2. All the while, he shrieks and yells phrases like, "Die, you filthy mercenaries!" or "You've no right to be in here!"</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Myre realizes a death by mercenary is preferable to death by spawn of Yog-Sothoth, so he fights to the death. If captured alive, he shrieks and cries and babbles madly, saying things like, "It's all Crove's fault!" and "I can hear it coming! Kill me before it gets me!"

    <DuringCombat>Hyve opens combat with a ranged sneak attack, then resorts to throwing vials of violet venom as grenadelike missiles (affecting struck targets and all within 5 feet). If engaged in melee, he relies on Improved Feint to maximize his sneak attacks with his rapier.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Keeper Hyve fights until brought below 15 hit points, at which point he attempts to escape by leaping into the sluice (area C3) and sliding down to area C4. If he survives the journey, he hides in area C4 and prepares another sneak attack with his ranged weapon. If cornered here, he'll fight to the death.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Corporeal Instability (Su) Claw&amp;#8211;contact; save Fort DC 17; effect amorphous body and 1 Wisdom drain per round (see below); cure corporeal instability can only be cured with magic (such as greater restoration, heal, remove curse, restoration, or heal). Corporeal instability is a curse effect. The save DC is Constitution-based. A blow from a chaos beast against a living creature can cause a terrible transformation. The creature must succeed on a Fortitude save or become a spongy, amorphous mass. Unless the victim manages to control the effect (see below), its shape melts, flows, writhes, and boils. An affected creature is unable to hold or use any item. Clothing, armor, rings, and helmets become useless. Large items worn or carried&amp;#8211;armor, backpacks, even shirts&amp;#8211;hamper more than help, reducing the victim's Dexterity score by 4. Soft or misshapen feet and legs reduce speed to 10 feet or one-quarter normal, whichever is less. Searing pain courses along the nerves, so intense that the victim cannot act coherently. The victim cannot cast spells or use magic items, and it attacks blindly, unable to distinguish friend from foe (&amp;#8211;4 penalty on attack rolls and a 50% miss chance, regardless of the attack roll). A victim can temporarily regain its own shape by taking a standard action to attempt a DC 15 Will save (this check DC does not vary for a chaos beast with different Hit Dice or ability scores). A success reestablishes the creature's normal form for 1 minute. Spells that change the victim's shape (such as alter self, beast shape, elemental body, and polymorph), do not remove the curse, but hold the creature in a stable form (which might not be its own form, depending on the spell) and prevent additional Wisdom drain for the duration of the spell; shapechange or stoneskin has a similar effect. The victim takes 1 point of Wisdom drain from mental shock every round that it ends its turn in an amorphous shape; the creature permanently becomes a chaos beast if this Wisdom drain equals or exceeds its actual Wisdom score. Immunity to Transformation (Ex) No mortal magic can permanently affect or fix a chaos beast's form. Effects such as polymorphing or petrification force the creature into a new shape, but at the start of its next turn, it immediately returns to its mutable form as a free action.</SpecialAbilities>
    <DuringCombat>The chaos beast attacks one creature until it succumbs to corporeal instability, then changes to another target and repeats this process. It leaves the area once all its opponents are amorphous.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>The chaos beast tries to flee if brought below 30 hp.</Morale>

The save DC is Charisma-based. A humanoid who dies of ghoul fever rises as a ghoul at the next midnight. A humanoid who becomes a ghoul in this way retains none of the abilities it possessed in life. It is not under the control of any other ghouls, but it hungers for the flesh of the living and behaves like a normal ghoul in all respects.

    <SpecialAbilities>Death Roll (Ex) When grappling a foe of its size or smaller, a giant crocodile can perform a death roll upon making a successful grapple check. As it clings to its foe, it tucks in its legs and rolls rapidly, twisting and wrenching its victim. The giant crocodile inflicts its bite damage and knocks the creature prone. If successful, the giant crocodile maintains its grapple. Hold Breath (Ex) A giant crocodile can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to 4 times its Constitution score before it risks drowning. Sprint (Ex) Once per minute a giant crocodile may sprint, increasing its land speed to 40 feet for 1 round.</SpecialAbilities>

    <SpecialAbilities>Incombustible Aura (Su) All creatures within 30 feet of a Tik Taan idol gain fire resistance 10. This effect lasts as long as a creature remains within the idol's aura. Any time a being makes active use of this resistance to any degree, the wood idol takes 1 point of normal damage, appearing more and more charred as it takes damage. This ability ceases to function should a Tik Taan idol have only 1 hit point and does not reactivate until it regains hit points. Primeval Curse (Su) Once per day, a Tik Taan idol can force a creature within 15 feet to make a DC 12 Will save or be cursed. This curse functions similarly to the spell bestow curse, except that it can only either decrease an ability score by &amp;#8211;4 or cause a &amp;#8211;2 penalty to attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks. In addition, while affected, the skin of the target takes on a rough, wooden appearance. A Tik Taan idol's curse can only affect one creature at a time, and should it curse another creature, the first target is no longer affected. This effect can be removed by remove curse or by eating a goodberry. The save DC is Charisma based. Regeneration (Ex) A Tik Taan idol's regeneration only functions while it is standing on wood, grass, or earth. Fire deals normal damage to a wood idol. Inanimate (Ex) An idol is effectively a statuette and does little to suggest otherwise. Spending most of its existence perfectly motionless, a stationary idol is indistinguishable from a normal inanimate object. Unless noted in its description, an idol can make use of the majority of its special abilities without moving, though the round after it does so observers can make a DC 25 Perception check to notice minute hints&amp;#8211;magical glimmers, minute contortions, etc.&amp;#8211;suggesting that the idol is actually animate. Overt actions, such as an idol moving or attacking, make its nature obvious to witnesses, and to others who make a Perception check (as previously noted) even 1 round after it moves. Share Abilities (Su) An idol can share any spell-like ability that would normally only affect itself (as the caster) with any ally within 5 feet. The idol's creator or allies familiar with its abilities may request the idol grant them specific powers on its turn. Spell-like abilities usable in this way are marked with an asterisk (*).</SpecialAbilities>
    <BeforeCombat>If made aware of the PCs' presence before they enter Area 7, the Tik Taan idol casts barkskin on Da'Tunga, increasing his AC by +2; otherwise it does so on the first round of combat.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>The Tik Taan idol is intelligent enough to avoid melee combat if at all possible. Instead, it uses its spell-like and special abilities to support Da'Tunga. As the North Exhibit Hall has flagstone floors, the Tik Taan's regeneration ability does not work in this location.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If reduced to 5 hp or less, the Tik Taan idol reverts to its inanimate state (see below), hoping that its attacker will lose interest. It continues using its spell-like and special abilities in this state. When the Tik Taan is destroyed all of the primates (including Da'Tunga) are stunned for 1 round, casting the room into a momentary, gloomy silence.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Feverish Fortitude (Su) All creatures within 30 feet of a Tik Taan idol gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against disease and poison. The effect lasts as long as a creature remains within the idol's aura. Mad Rage (Su) Any creature bitten by a Tik Taan idol must make a DC 16 Will save or fly into an uncontrollable, violent rage. Those affected by this rage are treated as being under the effects of both the spells rage and confusion for 1 minute. However, whenever the affected creature rolls a confusion result that would lead it to flee or attack the bone idol, the idol instead chooses a target for it to attack. This is a mindaffecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. Zombie Fetish (Su) Any zombie created within 30 feet of a Tik Taan idol rises as a fast zombie (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 289). Inanimate (Ex) An idol is effectively a statuette and does little to suggest otherwise. Spending most of its existence perfectly motionless, a stationary idol is indistinguishable from a normal inanimate object. Unless noted in its description, an idol can make use of the majority of its special abilities without moving, though the round after it does so observers can make a DC 25 Perception check to notice minute hints&amp;#8211;magical glimmers, minute contortions, etc.&amp;#8211;suggesting that the idol is actually animate.

Share Abilities (Su) An idol can share any spell-like ability that would normally only affect itself (as the caster) with any ally within 5 feet. The idol's creator or allies familiar with its abilities may request the idol grant them specific powers on its turn. Spell-like abilities usable in this way are marked with an asterisk (*).</SpecialAbilities>
    <DuringCombat>The Tik Taan idols are intelligent enough to avoid melee combat if at all possible. Instead, they use their spelllike and special abilities to support Da'Tunga. Any person slain during combat is immediately animated as a fast zombie (see ability description below).</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If reduced to 5 hp or less, a Tik Taan idol reverts to its inanimate state (see below), hoping that its attacker will lose interest. It continues using its spell-like and special abilities in this state. Every time one of the Tik Taan is destroyed all of the primates (including Da'Tunga) are stunned for 1 round, casting the room into a momentary, gloomy silence.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Create Spawn (Su) Any humanoid slain by a spectre becomes a spectre itself in 1d4 rounds. Spawn so created are less powerful than typical spectres, and suffer a &amp;#8211;2 penalty on all d20 rolls and checks, as well as &amp;#8211;2 hp per HD, and only drain one level on a touch. Spawn are under the command of the spectre that created them and remain enslaved until its death, at which point they lose their spawn penalties and become full-fledged and free-willed spectres. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life. Resurrection Vulnerability (Su) A raise dead or similar spell cast on a spectre destroys it (Will negates). Using the spell in this way does not require a material component. Sunlight Powerlessness (Su) Spectres are powerless in natural sunlight (not merely a daylight spell) and flee from it. A spectre caught in sunlight cannot attack and is staggered. Unnatural Aura (Su) Animals, whether wild or domesticated, can sense the unnatural presence of a spectre at a distance of 30 feet. They do not willingly approach nearer than that and panic if forced to do so unless a master succeeds at a DC 25 Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy check. A panicked animal remains so as long as it is within 30 feet of the spectre.</SpecialAbilities>

    <DuringCombat>These fighters use a cautious and defensive fighting style to keep enemies away. They always use combat expertise every round to increase their AC to 19 (reducing their attack roll with quarterstaves to +6). If surrounded by more than two PCs, they use whirlwind attack to strike multiple foes.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If reduced to 5 hit points or lower, these fighters fling down their quarterstaffs and surrender.</Morale>

Web (Ex) Creatures with the web ability can use webs to support themselves and up to one additional creature of the same size. In addition, such creatures can throw a web up to eight times per day. This is similar to an attack with a net but has a maximum range of 50 feet, with a range increment of 10 feet, and is effective against targets up to one size category larger than the web spinner. An entangled creature can escape with a successful Escape Artist check or burst the web with a Strength check. Both are standard actions with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 creature's HD + creature's Con modifier. Attempts to burst a web by those caught in it suffer a &amp;#8211;4 penalty. Web spinners can create sheets of sticky webbing up to three times their size. They usually position these sheets to snare flying creatures but can also try to trap prey on the ground. Approaching creatures must succeed on a DC 20 Perception check to notice a web; otherwise they stumble into it and become trapped as though by a successful web attack. Attempts to escape or burst the webbing gain a +5 bonus if the trapped creature has something to walk on or grab while pulling free. Each 5-foot-square section of web has a number of hit points equal to the Hit Dice of the creature that created it and DR 5/&amp;#8211;. A creature can move across its own web at its climb speed and</SpecialAbilities>

    <SpecialAbilities>Constrict (Ex) A giant crab can crush an opponent, dealing bludgeoning damage, after making a successful grapple check (in addition to any other effects caused by a successful check, including additional damage). Grab (Ex) If a giant crab hits with its claws, it deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. Grab works only against opponents at least one size category smaller than the creature. The creature has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use the part of its body it used in the grab to hold the opponent. If it chooses to do the latter, it takes a &amp;#8211;20 penalty on its CMB check to make and maintain the grapple, but does not gain the grappled condition itself. If a giant crab does not constrict, each successful grapple check it makes during successive rounds automatically deals the damage indicated for the attack that established the hold. Otherwise, it deals constriction damage as well. Water Dependency (Ex) Giant crabs can survive out of the water for 1 hour per point of Constitution. Beyond this limit, a giant crab runs the risk of suffocation, as if it were drowning.</SpecialAbilities>

If a giant crab does not constrict, each successful grapple check it makes during successive rounds automatically deals the damage indicated for the attack that established the hold. Otherwise, it deals constriction damage as well. Water Dependency (Ex) Giant crabs can survive out of the water for 1 hour per point of Constitution. Beyond this limit, a giant crab runs the risk of suffocation, as if it were drowning.</SpecialAbilities>

    <SpecialAbilities>Create Spawn (Su) Any humanoid slain by a spectre becomes a spectre themselves in 1d4 rounds. Spawn so created are less powerful than typical spectres, and suffer a &amp;#8211;2 penalty on all d20 rolls and checks, &amp;#8211;2 hp per HD, and only drain one level on a touch. Spawn are under the command of the spectre that created them and remain enslaved until its death, at which point they lose their spawn penalties and become full-fledged and free-willed spectres. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life. Resurrection Vulnerability (Su) A raise dead or similar spell cast on a spectre destroys it (Will negates). Using the spell in this way does not require a material component. Sunlight Powerlessness (Su) Spectres are powerless in natural sunlight (not merely a daylight spell) and flee from it. A spectre caught in sunlight cannot attack and is staggered. Unnatural Aura (Su) Animals, whether wild or domesticated, can sense the unnatural presence of a spectre at a distance of 30 feet. They do not willingly approach nearer than that and panic if forced to do so unless a master succeeds at a DC 25 Handle Animal, Ride, or wild empathy check. A panicked animal remains so as long as it is within 30 feet of the spectre.</SpecialAbilities>

    <SpecialAbilities>Gnaw (Ex) If a giant moray begins a round with a grabbed foe, it inflicts automatic bite damage (2d6+9 points of damage). A giant moray eel possesses a second set of jaws in its throat that aid in swallowing&amp;#8211;it can make a second bite attack (+11 attack, 1d6+4) against a foe it has already grabbed. Grab (Ex) If the giant moray eel hits with its bite, it deals normal damage and attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. Grab works only against opponents at least one size category smaller than the creature. The creature has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use the part of its body it used in the grab to hold the opponent. If it chooses to do the latter, it takes a &amp;#8211;20 penalty on its CMB check to make and maintain the grapple, but does not gain the grappled condition itself.

    <SpecialAbilities>Corrupting Touch (Su) By passing part of its incorporeal body through a foe's body as a standard action, the ghost inflicts 6d6 damage. This damage is not negative energy&amp;#8211;it manifests in the form of physical wounds and aches from supernatural aging. Creatures immune to magical aging are immune to this damage, but otherwise the damage bypasses all forms of damage reduction. A Fortitude save halves the damage inflicted. Rejuvenation (Su) In most cases, it's difficult to destroy a ghost through simple combat: the "destroyed" spirit restores itself in 2d4 days. Even the most powerful spells are usually only temporary solutions. The only way to permanently destroy a ghost is to determine the reason for its existence and set right whatever prevents it from resting in peace.

    <SpecialAbilities>Corrupting Touch (Su) By passing part of its incorporeal body through a foe's body as a standard action, the ghost inflicts 9d6 damage. This damage is not negative energy&amp;#8211;it manifests in the form of physical wounds and aches from supernatural aging. Creatures immune to magical aging are immune to this damage, but otherwise the damage bypasses all forms of damage reduction. A Fortitude save halves the damage inflicted. Malevolence (Su) The ghost's jealousy of the living is particularly potent. Once per round, the ghost can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane. This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (caster level 10th), except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the ghost must be adjacent to the target. The target can resist the attack with a successful Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same ghost's malevolence for 24 hours. Rejuvenation (Su) In most cases, it's difficult to destroy a ghost through simple combat: the "destroyed" spirit restores itself in 2d4 days. Even the most powerful spells are usually only temporary solutions. The only way to permanently destroy a ghost is to determine the reason for its existence and set right whatever prevents it from resting in peace. Telekinesis (Su) The ghost can use telekinesis as a standard action once every 1d4 rounds (CL 12th).</SpecialAbilities>

    <BeforeCombat>The quasits guard under the effect of their invisibility spell-like ability. If the PCs are using light, the quasits are aware of them as soon as their light source gets close to the eastern entrance of the room, otherwise the quasits on the eastern end of the bridge notice the PCs once they move to within 60 feet of the bridge (the quasits's darkvision allows them to easily spot visible intruders, even those trying to use Stealth). Once alerted by the PCs, five of the quasits change into wolf form and wait, invisibly, three flanking the east side of the bridge and two on the west. The last quasit remains in its normal form and flies near the ceiling, ready to dive down to aid any of its allies.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>One pair of wolf-quasits try to flank and trip a weak-looking character, then use invisibility on their next turn; the other pair then approaches and attacks, making it look like there is only one pair of wolves. They alternate this strategy for two rounds or until the PCs catch on to the ruse, at which point they assume their normal form and attack with claws and bite, turning invisible if wounded to give them time to retreat and heal with fast healing.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If the PCs are having an easy time killing the quasits, the last two or three try to retreat to the pyramid cavern and warn the drow of the PCs' impending arrival.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Protective Slime (Su) A layer of acidic slime coats a babau's skin. Any creature that strikes a babau with a natural attack or unarmed strike takes 1d8 points of acid damage from this slime if it fails a DC 18 Reflex save. A creature that strikes a babau with a melee weapon must make a DC 18 Reflex save or the weapon takes 1d8 points of acid damage; if this damage penetrates the weapon's hardness, the weapon gains the broken condition. Ammunition that strikes a babau is automatically destroyed after it inflicts its damage.</SpecialAbilities>
    <BeforeCombat>Whether the babaus hear the PCs arrive or a quasit informs them of the intruders, the babaus use their greater teleport ability to get to one of the hidden nooks in the southwest part of this cavern. From there they watch the PCs (even invisible ones, as babaus have constant see invisibility) and decide on the best way to approach and neutralize the PCs, typically by teleporting behind a stalagmite near a PC, then charging at or ambushing their target.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Babaus like to flank opponents so they can use sneak attack. Though they prefer to attack the most powerful creature present so they can neutralize the greatest threat, they recognize that their acid slime is harmful to creatures using natural attacks or unarmed strikes, and may gang up on animal companions or monks if the opportunity presents itself. They may use darkness to snuff the dim lights of the skull-torches, as their darkvision allows them to fight without penalty in darkness. They have been promised souls and slaves in exchange for their work, and growl about this in Abyssal once they reveal themselves to the PCs.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If brought to 10 hit points or less, a babau attempts to retreat, using greater teleport if safe to do so, transporting to the pyramid cavern to the southwest and warning its masters there. Neither demon uses its summon ability.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Poison (Ex) Bite&amp;#8211;injury; save Fort DC 16; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Str; cure 1 save. The save DC is Constitution-based. Spells A drider casts spells as a 6th-level cleric, sorcerer, or wizard, but does not gain any other class abilities. Web (Ex) Driders can use webs to support themselves and up to one additional creature of the same size. In addition, such creatures can throw a web up to eight times per day. This is similar to an attack with a net but has a maximum range of 50 feet, with a range increment of 10 feet, and is effective against targets up to one size category larger than the drider. An entangled creature can escape with a successful Escape Artist check or burst it with a Strength check. Both are standard actions with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 creature's HD + creature's Con modifier. Attempts to burst a web by those caught in it suffer a &amp;#8211;4 penalty. Driders can create sheets of sticky webbing up to three times their size. They usually position these sheets to snare flying creatures but can also try to trap prey on the ground. Approaching creatures must succeed on a DC 20 Perception check to notice a web; otherwise they stumble into it and become trapped as though by a successful web attack. Attempts to escape or burst the webbing gain a +5 bonus if the trapped creature has something to walk on or grab while pulling free. Each 5-foot section of webs has a number of hit points equal to the Hit Dice of the creature that created it, and sheet webs have damage reduction 5/&amp;#8211;. A drider can move across its own web at its climb speed and can pinpoint the location of any creature touching its web. Undersized Weapons (Ex) A drider wields weapons as if it were one size category smaller than its actual size (Medium weapons for most driders).</SpecialAbilities>
    <BeforeCombat>If the driders are warned about the PCs by the demons in the previous area, they cast mage armor (giving them AC 22, touch 12, flat-footed 19), invisibility, and (if there is time) target several stalactites around the cavern with darkness (not deeper darkness), then wait for the PCs to arrive.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>The driders break their invisibility by casting lightning bolt and follow up with magic missile or bow attacks. They remain in the air. They may cast invisibility again and move to another location (such as an area of darkness) to make attacks that can't be traced to them (such as suggestion or firing arrows, as lightning bolt and magic missile leave a visible trail that reveals the caster's location). If the PCs look like they're going to try to enter the pyramid, one drider casts web over the entrance. Remember that the ambient light in this room is dim light except right next to the pyramid, and the darkness spell reduces the light level by one step, so if the driders use darkness anywhere else in the cavern, normal-sighted PCs are effectively blind attacking targets in that area, while the driders can see perfectly well with their superior darkvision.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If things go poorly for the driders, they turn invisible and use distractions such as ghost sound and silent image to distract and confuse the PCs, giving the driders time to retreat into the pyramid and warn their allies. Because these driders have the young template, they are Medium size rather than Large and do not need to squeeze to move through the 5-foot-wide passages in the pyramid.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>If they have time to prepare for the PCs arrival, they lurk on top of the northeastern cluster of stalagmites, cast darkness in their area, and ready their hand crossbows to shoot poisoned bolts once the PCs come into view.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>The guards are trained in dealing with magic, and try to get into melee range with spellcasters so they can interrupt them. They also try to stand near PCs who want to be mobile, using their Stand Still feel to slow their enemies down.</DuringCombat>

    <BeforeCombat>The master researchers cast false life on themselves every day (this is already included in the above hit point totall). If expecting combat, they casts invisibility, followed by castings of summon monster IV every round to summon a hound archon (for the irony of using a lawful good archon against her enemies amuses them). Their first casting of summon monster IV is the bonus spell from their arcane bond daggers (which doesn't count toward the spells per day listed above).</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>If the researchers are not invisible at the start of combat, they cast invisibility. One then casts haste on the drow captain, the other casts summon monster IV if she hasn't done so once or twice already, with the first researcher following up with a summoning of her own. If the captain is having a hard time defeating the PCs, the researchers cast greater invisibility and false life on the captain, slow on their enemies, then turn invisible again and continue to cast either false life on the captain or another summon monster every round, saving one 4th-level spell slot.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If the captain is defeated and it looks like the PCs are going to be able to kill the researchers, they cast dimension door to teleport out of the pyramid and onto the floor of the cavern directly underneath it, then cast invisibility and try to escape back into the Darklands. If prevented from using dimension door, they cast charm person to gain temporary allies and try to fly "down" the floor tunnel and team up with the demon in area 5.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Dance of Ruin (Su) A vrock can dance and chant as a full-round action&amp;#8211;at the end of 3 rounds, a crackling wave of energy explodes from the vrock, dealing 5d6 points of electricity damage to all creatures within 100 feet. A DC 17 Reflex save halves this damage. For each additional vrock that joins in the dance, the damage increases by 5d6 and the DC to avoid the effect increases by +1, to a maximum of 20d6 when four or more vrocks are dancing (the DC continues to increase with additional vrocks, but the damage does not). The dance immediately ends and must be started anew if any of the participating vrocks is slain, stunned, or otherwise prevented from dancing. The save DC is Charisma-based. Spores (Ex) A vrock can release a cloud of spores from its body once every 3 rounds as a free action. Adjacent creatures take 1d8 points of damage from the spores, plus 1d4 points of damage per round for 10 rounds as the spores grow into thick green vines. Although ugly, the vines are harmless and wither away in 1d4 days if not shaved off before then. The spores can be destroyed by casting bless on the affected creatures or by sprinkling them with holy water. This attack can also be halted by effects that remove or provide immunity to disease. Stunning Screech (Su) Once per hour, a vrock can emit a shrill screech. All creatures except demons within a 30-foot-radius spread must succeed on a DC 18 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <BeforeCombat>The vrock casts mirror image if it expects battle.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>The vrock tries to use its spores ability at every opportunity as long as there is a creature adjacent to it. It uses its stunning screech the first time it has at least two enemies in range. Note that the vrock can fly under its own power at a faster speed than the ambient fly ability, so it can zoom around if it wants to, though it has a tendency to spin relative to the true gravity when it does this (so it would look upside-down to the PCs, though this doesn't hinder it in any way).</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>The demon is bound by an abyssal agreement to serve Jevana, and fights to the death.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Nausea (Ex) The noxious vapors and foul fluids that constantly weep and seethe from a hezrou's body are particularly heinous to those the creature grapples. Each round a creature is grappled by a hezrou, the grappled foe must make a DC 24 Fortitude save to avoid becoming nauseated. A creature nauseated in this manner remains nauseated until he succeeds on a DC 24 Fortitude save, or until a minute has passed during which he is not grappled by the hezrou, whichever condition comes first. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <BeforeCombat>If the demon can initiate combat, it casts unholy blight, following up with chaos hammer if there is time before melee.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>The hezrou uses blasphemy as soon as two or more enemies are in range, and enters melee on its next turn, using its grab special ability to hold an opponent while it bites and claws it to death. It prefers to deal with a grabbed opponent before all others, but an especially dangerous enemy convinces it to drop its current prey and attack the more deadly foe, either with natural weapons or another blasphemy.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>The demon is bound by an abyssal agreement to serve Jevana, and fights to the death.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>Jevana prepares for battle by casting freedom of movement and shield of faith on herself (giving her AC 25, touch 17, flat-footed 21). Her earlier casting of status includes her drider ally in this room.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>The priestess is brutal and decisive, having dealt with many betrayals and attempted coups within her noble house. She casts greater command (halt), then uses her feather token to attack an unarmored person (preferably a spellcaster), then casts unholy blight, bestow curse (&amp;#8211;4 penalty) on a meleeoriented opponent, hold person on anyone who has broken free of her greater command, and otherwise stays out of melee range and uses hand of the acolyte (+10 attack bonus) or cures her allies with her wand. She channels negative energy if there are no allies in range who would be harmed by it, or uses Channel Smite with melee attacks.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If gravely injured, she casts cure critical wounds on herself and tries to blanket the area in deeper darkness so she has a few rounds to heal herself with cure serious wounds or her wand. If she thinks she will be killed, she uses her scroll of word of recall to return to her temple sanctuary and plot her revenge against the PCs.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Poison (Ex) Bite&amp;#8211;injury; save Fort DC 18; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Str; cure 1 save. The save DC is Constitutionbased. Spells A drider casts spells as a 6th-level cleric, sorcerer, or wizard, but does not gain any other class abilities. Undersized Weapons (Ex) Although a drider is Large, its upper torso is the same size as that of a Medium humanoid's upper torso. As a result, it wields weapons as if it were one size category smaller than its actual size (Medium for most driders). Web (Ex) Driders can use webs to support themselves and up to one additional creature of the same size. In addition, such creatures can throw a web up to eight times per day. This is similar to an attack with a net but has a maximum range of 50 feet, with a range increment of 10 feet, and is effective against targets up to one size category larger than the drider. An entangled creature can escape with a successful Escape Artist check or burst it with a Strength check. Both are standardactions with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 creature's HD + creature's Con modifier. Attempts to burst a web by those caught in it suffer a &amp;#8211;4 penalty. Driders can create sheets of sticky webbing up to three times their size. They usually position these sheets to snare flying creatures but can also try to trap prey on the ground. Approaching creatures must succeed on a DC 20 Perception check to notice a web; otherwise they stumble into it and become trapped as though by a successful web attack. Attempts to escape or burst the webbing gain a +5 bonus if the trapped creature has something to walk on or grab while pulling free. Each 5-foot section of webs has a number of hit points equal to the Hit Dice of the creature that created it, and sheet webs have damage reduction 5/&amp;#8211;. A drider can move across its own web at its climb speed and can pinpoint the location of any creature touching its web.</SpecialAbilities>
    <DuringCombat>The drider fiercely protects Jevana, attempting at all times to keep the PCs away from her.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>The drider fights to the death.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>Thugmar doesn't have any equipment that requires preparation, and saves his enlarge person ability for when he needs it the most.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Thugmar is evil, but he is no fool. He doesn't want to fight the PCs, especially not to protect Jevana, and he absolutely does not want to die here. He fights defensively (&amp;#8211;4 penalty on all attacks, +2 dodge bonus to AC) and with the intent to deal only nonlethal damage (&amp;#8211;4 penalty to attack), making half-hearted swings that (with these penalties) mean he is unlikely to hit anyone. He tries to fight the most heavilyarmored person so he has even less of a chance to hit, and if he does happen to hit his opponent, he winces and looks apologetic.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If Jevana falls (even if the driders are still alive), he throws down his weapon and surrenders, preferably to a non-dwarf PC. If the PCs continue to attack him, he tries to flee.</Morale>

    <DuringCombat>On the first round of combat, Zamir orders Jumra to attack and tries fruitlessly to activate the scepter of the arclords. Zamir keeps Jumra between him and attackers and casts produce flame, hurling fire at the nearest enemy. He switches to his scimitar once he's run out of flames.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If Jumra is slain or Zamir is reduced to 9 or fewer hit points, he attempts to retreat down the south tunnel. He casts soften earth and stone, which causes part of the ceiling to collapse, providing an exit through which he flees.</Morale>

    <DuringCombat>On the first round of combat, Zamir orders Jumra to attack and tries fruitlessly to activate the scepter of the arclords. Zamir keeps Jumra between him and his opponents and casts produce flame, hurling fire at the nearest enemy. He switches to his scimitar once he's run out of flames. If he or Jumra are injured for more than 10 hit points, Zamir casts cure moderate wounds.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If Jumra is slain or Zamir is reduced to 9 or fewer hit points, he attempts to retreat down the south tunnel. He casts soften earth and stone, which causes part of the ceiling to collapse, providing an exit through which he flees. He uses wild shape to take the form of a tiger to escape.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Death Roll (Ex) When grappling a foe of its size or smaller, a crocodile can perform a death roll upon making a successful grapple check. As it clings to its foe, it tucks in its legs and rolls rapidly, twisting and wrenching its victim. The crocodile inflicts its bite damage and knocks the creature prone. If successful, the crocodile maintains its grapple. Hold Breath (Ex) A crocodile can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to 4 times its Constitution score before it risks drowning. Sprint (Ex) Once per minute, a crocodile may sprint, increasing its land speed to 40 feet for 1 round.</SpecialAbilities>

    <SpecialAbilities>Intimidating Charge (Ex) When a savage lizard charges, it hisses ferociously, extends its neck frills, and darts forward on its hind legs, increasing its base speed to 50 feet for that round. In addition to the normal effects of a charge, the creature charged must make a DC 15 Will save or be shaken for 1d6 rounds. This is a fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>

    <SpecialAbilities>Energy Drain (Su)A succubus drains energy from a mortal she lures into an act of passion, such as a kiss. An unwilling victim must be grappled before the succubus can use this ability. The succubus's kiss bestows one negative level. The kiss also has the effect of a suggestion spell, asking the victim to accept another act of passion from the succubus. The victim must succeed on a DC 22 Will save to negate the suggestion. The DC is 22 for the Fortitude save to remove a negative level. These save DCs are Charisma-based. Profane Gift (Su)Once per day as a full-round action, a succubus may grant a profane gift to a willing humanoid creature by touching it for 1 full round. The target gains a +2 profane bonus to an ability score of his choice. A single creature may have no more than one profane gift from a succubus at a time. As long as the profane gift persists, the succubus can communicate telepathically with the target across any distance (and may use her suggestion spell-like ability through it). A profane gift is removed by dispel evil or dispel chaos. The succubus can remove it as well as a free action (causing 2d6 Charisma drain to the victim, no save).</SpecialAbilities>

    <BeforeCombat>The Razor disguises herself as a mermaid usingchange shape and imparts her profane gift on both of her minions.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>The Razor uses greater teleport frequently to move around the battlefield, and repeatedly uses suggestion (telling a PC to lie down) to confuse her opponents and vampiric touch when she needs to. She only attempts her energy drain ability if she can catch an arcane or divine caster alone on the fringe of the battlefield.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If brought below 10 hit points, the Razor teleports away, leaving her minions behind.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Immunity to Magic (Ex) A caryatid column is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. A transmute rock to mud spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to a caryatid column, with no saving throw. Transmute mud to rock, on the other hand, heals any lost hit points. A stone to flesh spell does not actually change the column's structure but negates its damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1 full round. Shatter Weapons (Ex) Whenever a character strikes a caryatid column with a weapon (magical or nonmagical), the weapon takes 2d6 points of damage. Apply the weapon's hardness normally. Weapons that take any amount of damage in excess of their hardness gain the broken quality. Statue (Ex) A caryatid column can stand perfectly still, emulating a statue (usually one that is holding up the ceiling, like a carved column). An observer must succeed on a DC 20 Perception check to notice the caryatid column is alive.</SpecialAbilities>

    <SpecialAbilities>Fungoid Umbilicals (Ex) Five 20-foot-long fungoid umbilicals connect Imrizade to the Gate of Beyond (and to the mind of Kubburum Ishme-dagan), attached to her hips, shoulders, and the base of her skull, cumulatively providing her with fast healing 3. The umbilicals may be individually attacked using the sunder combat maneuver. Each umbilical has hardness 2 and 5 hit points. Each severed umbilical inflicts 1d3 points of damage to Imrizade, and her fast healing is reduced by 1 for every two severed umbilicals. Severing all five umbilicals disconnects Imrizade from the Gate but she remains possessed by Kubburum.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Gender>Female</Gender>
    <Bloodline>aberrant</Bloodline>
    <BeforeCombat>Imrizade uses her scroll of mage armor as soon as she hears screeching from area 6. When the alarm in area 8 goes off, she uses her scroll of shield.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Imrizade directs her zombie to engage opponents, while she casts color spray from her wand to catch as many approaching enemies as possible. She then stands behind her zombie and uses her long limbs to deliver touch attacks, particularly shocking grasp against foes wearing metal armor. She targets spellcasters with magic missile to try to disrupt their spells. If she runs out of spells or is forced into melee combat, she uses her last 1st-level spell to cast enlarge person and attempts to make sneak attacks with her enlarged rapier.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Possessed by the ghostly brain of Kubburum Ishmedagan, Imrizade fights to the death. If Kubburum's cylinder is destroyed, however, Imrizade is freed from possession and surrenders.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>Imrizade casts shield and spectral hand (losing 2 hit points) as soon as she hears the alarm from area 8.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Imrizade begins by casting black tentacles from her scroll, then directs her zombies to engage grappled opponents. She stays behind the zombies and delivers touch spells with her spectral hand. She uses ghoul touch against other spellcasters and against foes who come within range of the yellow musk creeper's attacks, and targets obvious warriors (especially wearing metal armor) with shocking grasp and ray of enfeeblement from her wand. If it looks like enemies might get past her zombies, Imrizade creates more undead from her robe of bones. If forced into melee, she uses her long limbs to deliver unarmed strikes with touch spells from beyond her opponents' reach, making sneak attacks if possible. Imrizade uses vampiric touch to replenish her hit points as needed.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Possessed by the ghostly brain of Kubburum Ishmedagan, Imrizade fights to the death. If Kubburum's cylinder is destroyed, however, Imrizade is freed from possession and surrenders.</Morale>

Yellow musk zombies lack undead traits, but gain plant traits. They are treated as plants, not undead, for the resolution of magical effects and attacks.

    <BeforeCombat>Once they spot the PCs, the skeletal champions rage. Rage has already been figured into their stats.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>The skeletal champions possess great intelligence (for undead) and use it to flank the PCs and tactically retreat and strike again when they can. If a cleric uses his channel positive energy ability against the skeletal champions, they immediately focus all of their rage on that PC.</DuringCombat>

    <SpecialAbilities>Feign Death (Ex) With a successful Bluff check, a nightmare creature can make itself appear dead. Any creature wishing to ascertain whether the nightmare creature is really dead must make a Heal check opposed by the nightmare creature's Bluff check. The nightmare creature cannot move or take any actions pretending to be dead. In addition, whenever a nightmare creature falls unconscious, it appears dead. A DC 15 Heal check is required to ascertain if the nightmare creature is alive. Nightmare creatures use this ability to escape destruction, to gain revenge, or to trick foes into approaching them. The Heal check DC is Charisma-based. Night Terrors (Su) A nightmare creature can enter the dreams of a sleeping creature at will as a standard action. This ability has the same effect as a dream spell, except that once inside the dream of another creature, the nightmare creature can control the dream world with which the sleeper interacts. While inside the victim's dream, the nightmare creature can attempt to control it. The victim must succeed on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 nightmare creature's character level + nightmare creature's Charisma modifier) or remain unconscious and asleep, trapped in the dream world with the nightmare creature. The nightmare creature controls all aspects of the dream world, and the victim is powerless to change anything&amp;#8211;although the nightmare creature might allow it to think it has such power or even that it has awakened from the dream. Each hour thereafter, the victim must make a new Will save. Success allows it to awaken immediately; failure means it remains asleep and trapped in the dream world. The victim automatically awakens after 8 hours if it is still alive. Each hour that the victim remains trapped in sleep by the nightmare creature, it takes 1d4 points of Charisma damage. A creature that has taken Charisma damage during its dream awakens fatigued and does not heal or regain spells as it normally would while resting. A creature reduced to 0 Charisma this way dies. A wish or miracle spell or an antimagic field ends the effect and awakens the victim. A protection from evil spell blocks night terrors for its duration, but it does not awaken the victim. A dream spell used on the sleeping creature allows the victim a new save to break free of the effect, but the deliverer of the dream message must succeed on a Will save or be trapped in sleep with the nightmare creature ruling its dreams, just as though it were the original target of the night terrors. A blanket of silver links worth at least 2,000 gp prevents a nightmare creature from entering a creature's dreams so long as it is in contact with the sleeping creature, but it has no effect if placed on a sleeping creature already embroiled in night terrors. Nightmare Spellcasting (Su) A nightmare creature's effectivecaster level for fear, phantasm, and shadow spells increases by +2 over that of the base creature. Protection from Good (Su) A nightmare creature gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves against attacks by good creatures. Furthermore, it is immune to any attempt by a good creature to posses, charm, or influence it.</SpecialAbilities>

    <BeforeCombat>If Lady Morilaeth detects the PCs she casts disguise self to change her appearance to that of a derro, albeit the tallest derro in the room.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Once disguised, Morilaeth joins the revelers, hoping to get close to the PCs and surprise them with channeled negative energy. Morilaeth is aware of the effect her fear aura will have on the mites and derros&amp;#8211;namely, when she uses it, most of them will run from the room&amp;#8211;and she doesn't hesitate to use it. Nor does she hesitate to use her channel negative energy ability to injure both the PCs and the revelers. While fighting, Morilaeth repeatedly screams, "You will dream of me!"</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If reduced to less than 5 hit points, Lady Morilaeth retreats to area 13 to regenerate. If she's unable to make it, she uses feign death and regenerates.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Feign Death (Ex) With a successful Bluff check, a nightmare creature can make itself appear dead. Any creature wishing to ascertain whether the nightmare creature is really dead must make a Heal check opposed by the nightmare creature's Bluff check. The nightmare creature cannot move or take any actions pretending to be dead. In addition, whenever a nightmare creature falls unconscious, it appears dead. A DC 16 Heal check is required to ascertain if the nightmare creature is alive. Nightmare creatures use this ability to escape destruction, to gain revenge, or to trick foes into approaching them. The Heal check DC is Charisma-based. Night Terrors (Su) A nightmare creature can enter the dreams of a sleeping creature at will as a standard action. This ability has the same effect as a dream spell, except that once inside the dream of another creature, the nightmare creature can control the dream world with which the sleeper interacts. While inside the victim's dream, the nightmare creature can attempt to control it. The victim must succeed on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 nightmare creature's character level + nightmare creature's Charisma modifier) or remain unconscious and asleep, trapped in the dream world with the nightmare creature. The nightmare creature controls all aspects of the dream world, and the victim is powerless to change anything&amp;#8211;although the nightmare creature might allow it to think it has such power or even that it has awakened from the dream. Each hour thereafter, the victim must make a new Will save. Success allows it to awaken immediately; failure means it remains asleep and trapped in the dream world. The victim automatically awakens after 8 hours if it is still alive. Each hour that the victim remains trapped in sleep by the nightmare creature, it takes 1d4 points of Charisma damage. A creature that has taken Charisma damage during its dream awakens fatigued and does not heal or regain spells as it normally would while resting. A creature reduced to 0 Charisma this way dies. A wish or miracle spell or an antimagic field ends the effect and awakens the victim. A protection from evil spell blocks night terrors for its duration, but it does not awaken the victim. A dream spell used on the sleeping creature allows the victim a new save to break free of the effect, but the deliverer of the dream message must succeed on a Will save or be trapped in sleep with the nightmare creature ruling its dreams, just as though it were the original target of the night terrors. A blanket of silver links worth at least 2,000 gp prevents a nightmare creature from entering a creature's dreams so long as it is in contact with the sleeping creature, but it has no effect if placed on a sleeping creature already embroiled in night terrors. Nightmare Spellcasting (Su) A nightmare creature's effective caster level for fear, phantasm, and shadow spells increases by +2 over that of the base creature. Protection from Good (Su) A nightmare creature gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves against attacks by good creatures. Furthermore, it is immune to any attempt by a good creature to posses, charm, or influence it.</SpecialAbilities>

    <BeforeCombat>If Lady Morilaeth detects the PCs she casts disguise self to change her appearance to that of a derro, albeit the tallest derro in the room.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Once disguised, Morilaeth joins the revelers, hoping to get close to the PCs and surprise them with channeled negative energy. Morilaeth is aware of the effect her fear aura will have on the mites and derros&amp;#8211;namely, when she uses it, most of them will run from the room&amp;#8211;and she doesn't hesitate to use it. Nor does she hesitate to use her channel negative energy ability to injure both the PCs and the revelers. While fighting, Morilaeth repeatedly screams, "You will dream of me!"</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If reduced to less than 5 hit points, Lady Morilaeth retreats to area 13 to regenerate. If she's unable to make it, she uses feign death and regenerates.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>Jirandiel is suspicious of the PCs. If she sees Caradoc with them, she immediately orders her sailors to recover him from the PCs and attacks.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Jirandiel attempts to flank opponents with the sailors, so she can use her sneak attack ability. In addition, she always chooses to forgo her second attack on a full attack action so she can use her parry and riposte abilities (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 383) to block incoming melee strikes and take an attack of opportunity.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Jirandiel surrenders if brought below 5 hit points.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Superior Grappler (Ex) A gaav can wield a weapon and still make grapple checks. If it's not wielding a weapon, a gaav gains a +4 bonus on grapple checks. Each gaav can lift up to 50 pounds and still fly without being impeded. Noxious Breath (Su) Three times per day, a gaav can exhale a breath that reeks of pure corruption upon a creature within 5 feet. The target must make a DC 14 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitutionbased. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same gaav's noxious breath for 24 hours. A delay poison or neutralize poison spell removes the effect from the sickened creature. Creatures with immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on their saving throws. Once a gaav uses its breath weapon, it can't breathe again until 1d4 rounds later.</SpecialAbilities>
    <BeforeCombat>The gaav has already used its summon devil ability for the day, summoning an imp to explore the surrounding territory.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>The gaav attacks the nearest target relentlessly, only changing targets if the first is unconscious or otherwise incapacitated.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>The gaav fights until brought below 5 hit points and then attempts to fly away. If successful, the gaav flees and does not return to bother the PCs again.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Infernal Wound (Ex) The damage a magaav deals with its claws or rend causes a persistent wound. An injured creature loses 1 additional hit point each round. The wound does not heal naturally and resists healing spells. The continuing hit point loss can be stopped by a DC 16 Heal check or any spell that cures hit point damage; casting a curative spell on the injured creature requires a successful DC 15 caster level check, otherwise the spell has no effect. The check DC is Constitution-based. Master Grappler (Ex) A magaav can wield a weapon and still make grapple checks. If it's not wielding a weapon, a magaav gains a +4 bonus on grapple checks. Noxious Breath (Su) Three times per day, a magaav can exhale a breath that reeks of pure corruption upon a creature within 5 feet. The target must make a DC 16 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution based. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same magaav's noxious breath for 24 hours. A delay poison or neutralize poison spell removes the effect from the sickened creature. Creatures with immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonuses on their saving throws. Once a magaav uses its breath weapon, it can't breathe again until 1d4 rounds later.</SpecialAbilities>
    <BeforeCombat>The magaav has already used its summon devil ability for the day, summoning gaavs to explore the surrounding territory.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>The magaav is a tactical fighter and attempts to attack the weakest PC (wearing light or no armor, has obvious wounds, etc.) each round.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>The magaav fights until brought below 5 hit points and then attempts to fly away. If successful, the magaav returns to area F4 where the PCs encounter it later.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Dream Form (Su) A primordial demon has no physical form and only exists in the subconscious realm of dreams. Because it exists only as thought and concept, it can neither leave this realm nor exist in any other plane, realm, or reality. Any creature slain by a primordial demon does not die in the material plane. Instead, the individual falls unconscious and is forced from the dream realm (see above). Psychic Implosion (Su) As a full-round action, a primordial demon can constrict his tendrils to psychically rend the mind of a grappled victim. The attack deals 8d6 points of psychic damage, though the victim may attempt a DC 21 Will save for half damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <DuringCombat>The primordial demon begins combat by using its weird ability on all of the PCs. Starting on the second round, it attacks a single target each round with its tendrils, grappling when possible and then using its psychic implosion ability until that target is "killed" and ejected from the dream realm&amp;#8211;it then selects another target, likely the one dealing the most damage to it, and hits that target and so on.</DuringCombat>

    <SpecialAbilities>Dream Form (Su) A primordial demon has no physical form and only exists within the subconscious realm of dreams. Because it exists only as thought and concept, it can neither leave this realm nor exist in any other plane, realm, or reality. Likewise, the only way for a mortal to confront the creature is to travel to its realm. Methods include meditation, suffering head injury that renders one unconscious, dreaming, and spells that permit planar travel (such as planeshift). Any creature slain by a primordial demon does not die in the Material Plane. Instead, the individual falls unconscious and is forced from the dream realm (see above). Psychic Implosion (Su) As a full-round action, a primordial demon can constrict his tendrils to psychically rend the mind of a grappled victim.

    <SpecialAbilities>Sprint (Ex) Once per minute, a shadow demon increases its fly speed to 240 feet for 1 round. Shadow Blend (Su) During any conditions other than bright light, a shadow demon can disappear into the shadows as a move-equivalent action, effectively becoming invisible. Artificial illumination or light spells of 2nd level or lower do not negate this ability. Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex) A shadow demon is utterly powerless in bright light or natural sunlight and flees from it. A shadow demon caught in such light cannot attack and can take only a single move or attack action. A shadow demon possessing a creature using magic jar is not harmed by sunlight, but if it is struck by a sunbeam or sunray spell while possessing a creature, the shadow demon is driven out of its host automatically.</SpecialAbilities>

    <BeforeCombat>Tashelia watches intently as her thugs rough up Queck, the Hall of Wonders' head engineer. She suffers a &amp;#8211;4 penalty on Perception checks because of the loud noise.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Tashelia casts spells before entering melee, preferring to stay on the catwalk and target melee PCs with searing light, sound burst, and bane. She begins combat by summoning a medium earth elemental and prefers to avoid melee combat. If forced into melee, she casts true strike and shield of faith on herself (if possible).</DuringCombat>

    <DuringCombat>Razorcraw allows his gargoyles to lead the attack as they are better fliers than he is. He waits for one PC to separate himself from the others and swoops to attack that one while away from help. If such an opportunity does not present itself, Razorcraw instead attempts to flank a fighter with one of his gargoyles and poison him as many times as possible with his attacks.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Razorcraw surrenders if reduced below 15 hit points and escape doesn't seem possible.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>This young satyr is lost, having become separated from his patrol when they fled the diseased dryads. His initial attitude toward the PCs is unfriendly, as he suspects them of involvement in the spreading plague. He only attacks if the PCs attack him or reduce him to hostile.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Without his weapons, the satyr attempts to keep as much distance between himself and the PCs as possible. He uses fear, suggestion, and sleep to eliminate PCs from the fight, targeting the most threatening PCs first. He already cast summon nature's ally III to escape from the infected dryads' glade, but the monster he summoned was killed.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If reduced to fewer than 10 hp, the satyr attempts to flee into the woods.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Site Bound (Su) Abysiel is bound in place by sturdy chains and ancient magic. His speed is 0 ft. and he is incapable of any movement. He is immune to all combat maneuvers or any other ability or spell that could move him or knock him prone. Abysiel is always considered flat-footed, even when aware of attacks. The process that bound him to the Tangle also granted Abysiel a +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution and infused him with the light fortification armor quality. Site Bound Defenses (Su) Abysiel is protected by the device in which he is held captive. Because of its moving parts and magical energies, it grants him a +2 deflection bonus and a +4 shield bonus to his AC. The shield bonus functions like the shield spell and thus makes him immune to magic missile. Site Mastery (Su) By mingling his essence with his grand device, Abysiel can reflexively control its components. As a move action, he may move any one of the following components and gain the listed benefits: Chains: Abysiel animates the workshop's many chains to grapple a single target, as if using the animate rope spell, with the exception that the chains can reach any opponent within the workshop. Paneling: By shifting the outer paneling of his grand device, Abysiel grants himself total cover from one-quarter of the chamber below. This cover remains in place until changed again. This cover does not apply to opponents on the catwalks. Pendulums: Abysiel causes one of the device's massivependulums to swing at a target that inflicts 1d8 bludgeoning damage with a +3 melee touch attack. Abysiel can target anyone in the room with this ability, even those on the catwalk.</SpecialAbilities>

    <DuringCombat>Abysiel is madness incarnate and is far beyond reason&amp;#8211;he attacks the moment he sees the PCs. Abysiel begins combat by casting hypnotism on heavily armored PCs, ordering them to cast aside their weapons. He uses site mastery to attack any obvious casters, and casts obscuring mist to gain cover if anyone engages him in melee. He then rains down acidic rays or magic missiles.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Abysiel is beyond reason and rational thought. He fights to the death.</Morale>

    <DuringCombat>1: PCs make DC 20 Perception check to notice area L13 doors open. Invisible archers take position. Four take position on west balcony while the other four run to their position near the top of the stairs on the north side of the room to make a screen for the Raven's escape. 2: Four archers fire two flaming burst arrows and two regular arrows at PCs. All three attacks are made at &amp;#8211;2. This first attack also benefits from the Vital Strike feat, which means its damage dice are rolled twice on a successful hit. The other four fire at Osprey or NPC servants. 3: Archers concentrate their fire on the PCs that are the most easy to hit. 4: Repeat. 5: Repeat, though in this round the archers run out of their flaming burst arrows.</DuringCombat>

    <BeforeCombat>Cale the Calistrian favors self-preservation over all things, including his mission to steal the Pale Maiden. Before the PCs arrive, he casts displacement and fire shield on himself and arcane lock on the door to area L3. If the PCs take a while breaking down the magically held door, Cale continues to layer defensive spells upon himself, starting with protection from energy (most likely fire, but Cale chooses wisely if he has reason to know the PCs favor a certain energy type).</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Cale unleashes a web on the PCs when they enter area L9. Thereafter, he focuses on damage-dealing spells like additional ice storms, fireball, and lightning bolt.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If all of his associates are killed or near death, Cale the Calistrian employs teleport to send himself to the entrance of the Maze of the Open Road on the lodge's rear lawn.</Morale>

If detected or if she can place herself in a position to affect more than three PCs with her petrifying gaze, Condria becomes visible (probably by casting slow on her enemies). She uses dimension door and invisibility to disappear from combat, repositioning herself for a deadly attack.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Condria does not flee, protecting her home to the death. If she is killed, Narven's curse reforms her mortal body at area M4 24 hours later. She cannot leave the Maze of the Open Road under any circumstances.</Morale>

    <Morale>The thugs fight until one of them is slain or all drop below 2 hit points, at which point they throw down their weapons in surrender. Pleading for mercy, they admit to thievery and offer their spoils in exchange for their lives (area F5). If asked about the lodge or its former occupants, the thugs quickly explain that they found their slain corpses when they arrived, and swear they aren't murderers. As proof, they offer to let the PCs inspect the corpses and reveal that they stuffed the bodies into barrels on the cold porch (area G8).</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Enchantment Weakness (Ex) The weakened conviction of the soulbound doll's soul makes her susceptible to mind-affecting effects, despite her construct traits. Soul Focus (Su) The soul bound to the doll lives within a focus integrated into the doll or its apparel, in the Diva's case a gem embedded into the doll's chest. As long as this soul focus remains intact, it can be built into another doll for the soul to animate, using the same cost as creating a new construct. Once bound into the soul focus, the soul continues to learn, and so if later put into a new doll body, the soul retains its personality and memories from its previous body or bodies. The Diva's soul focus has hardness 8, 12 hit points, and a break DC of 20.</SpecialAbilities>

Once their attention is diverted, she uses her scroll of suggestion on the PC with the highest Charisma, directing that PC to play a somber dirge on the organ. If the PC makes a mistake at the keyboard (Perform [any] DC 10), the Diva attacks in anger.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>The Diva avoids melee combat, using levitate to keep combatants at a distance.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>The Diva fights until destroyed, though even if reduced to 0 hit points, if her soul focus isn't removed and destroyed (see below) she could eventually be reconstructed and placed into a new soulbound doll body.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Death Throes (Su) When a dark creeper is slain, its body combusts in a flash of bright white light, leaving its gear in a heap on the ground. All creatures within a 10-foot burst must make a DC 13 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d6 rounds. Other dark creepers within 10 feet are automatically blinded for at least 1 round, due to their light blindness. The save is Constitution-based. Poison Use (Ex) Dark creepers are skilled in the use of poison and never risk accidentally poisoning themselves. Dark creepers favor a foul-smelling black paste distilled from certain deep-underground fungi, known as black smear&amp;#8211;injury; save Fort DC 15; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Str; cure 1 save. Rag Armor (Ex) A dark creeper's multiple layers of filthy rags function as leather armor when worn by one of their kind. See in Darkness (Su) A dark creeper can see perfectly in darkness of any kind, including that created by deeper darkness.</SpecialAbilities>

    <SpecialAbilities>Death Throes (Su) When a dark stalker is slain, its body combusts in a flash of white-hot flame. This flame acts like a fireball that deals 3d6 points of fire damage to all creatures within a 20-foot-radius burst. A DC 11 Reflex save halves this damage. A dark stalker's gear and treasure are unaffected by this explosion. The save is Constitution-based. Poison Use (Ex) Black Smear&amp;#8211;injury; save Fort DC 15; frequency 1/ round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Str; cure 1 save. The poison DC is constitution-based. Dark stalkers are skilled in the use of poison and never risk accidentally poisoning themselves. Like their diminutive kin, the dark creepers, dark stalkers use black poison on their weapons and generally carry six doses on them. See in Darkness (Su) A dark stalker can see perfectly in darkness of any kind, including that created by deeper darkness.</SpecialAbilities>

    <SpecialAbilities>Lashing Tail (Su) A huldra's tail slap is a primary attack. In addition, each time a huldra damages a creature with her tail slap, she deals 1d4 points of Charisma damage, causing her target to grow progressively more deformed and ugly with each strike. A successful DC 15 Fortitude save negates the Charisma damage. The save DC is Constitution-based. Manipulate Luck (Su) Once per day, a huldra can manipulate another creature's luck by spending a full-round action, during which the huldra must remain in physical contact with the target creature. When the huldra uses this ability, she must choose whether she is imparting good luck or bad luck. A creature granted good luck gains a +2 luck bonus on all saving throws, attack rolls, and skill checks, while a creature afflicted with bad luck takes a &amp;#8211;4 penalty on all saving throws, attack rolls, and skill checks. A successful DC 18 Will save negates the effect. Huldras cannot be the target of this ability. This effect lasts for 24 hours and is a curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>

    <SpecialAbilities>Avoidance (Ex) When a mindslaver mold is infesting a living or an undead creature, it can attempt a Reflex save as an immediate action to completely avoid an attack that would normally have hit it. This attack instead harms the infested creature&amp;#8211;the mold effectively slithers out of the way of the incoming attack so that the blow strikes the creature it controls. The mindslaver mold must choose to attempt avoidance after the attack roll is resolved but before damage is rolled. Infestation (Su) A mindslaver mold can climb onto and attach itself to a willing or helpless host as a standard action. As long as the mold infests its host, the mold shares the same 5-foot square with its host's space; this does not negatively impact the host or the mold. As long as a mindslaver mold infests a host, the host takes a &amp;#8211;4 penalty on all Will saves made against the mindslaver mold's dominate person spell-like ability, and the duration of that spell-like ability on the host becomes permanent as long as the mold remains attached. Each day, an attached mindslaver mold deals 1d4 points of damage to its host as it feeds on the host's blood and other bodily fluids. A mindslaver mold can be torn free from its host with a successful DC 15 Strength check made as a standard action&amp;#8211;doing so deals 2d6 points of damage as the mold's tendrils tear free. A dead mindslaver mold deals no damage when it is so removed. Mold Mindlink (Su) A mindslaver mold can communicate telepathically with any other mindslaver mold within 10 miles, and knows the condition of all other mindslaver molds in this area as if it had a status spell in effect on all other molds. Spore Pod (Ex) A mindslaver mold's sole physical attack is to launch a spore pod the size of a sling bullet. This is a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 20 feet. Spores (Su) Whenever a mindslaver mold hits a creature with its spore pod, or whenever a creature touches a mindslaver mold (including when a creature hits the mold with a touch attack, unarmed strike, or natural attack), the creature must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save to avoid taking 1d4 points of Wisdom damage as the mold's spores swiftly drain away the victim's willpower and sense of self. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <DuringCombat>The mindslaver mold uses its avoidance ability to evade attacks, firing spore pods at anyone attacking it or Finngarth.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If the mindslaver mold is removed from Finngarth, or if Finngarth is slain, the mold attempts to find a new host. It casts dominate person on the closest creature to allow it to infest a new victim.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Beast Form (Su) When angered or intoxicated, a baccae takes on a beastlike visage, growing sharpened fangs and claws. This transformation lasts for 1 hour and cannot be ended voluntarily. Charming Gaze (Su) In human form, a baccae can charm any humanoid within 30 feet who meets her gaze. This functions as a charm person spell (CL 5th). An affected creature can attempt a DC 15 Will save to resist the effects. A baccae can suppress this ability as a free action. The save DC is Charisma-based. Rage (Su) Once per day, a baccae in beast form can fly into a berserk frenzy. This frenzy lasts for 10 rounds. In this rage, she gains temporary bonuses to two ability scores: +4 Strength and +4 Constitution. She likewise gains a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but takes a &amp;#8211;2 penalty to Armor Class. A baccae cannot voluntarily end her rage.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Gender>Female</Gender>
    <DuringCombat>The baccae rage on the first round of combat, focusing their attacks on male opponents.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>While raging, the baccae fight to the death. Otherwise, they flee into the woods if reduced to fewer than 10 hit points.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>Nazhena casts false life and mage armor every day. Once enemies enter area M11, she drinks potions of barkskin and shield of faith and activates her flight hex.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Nazhena casts summon monster IV on the first round of combat to summon an ice mephit. She then casts spectral hand, relying on her ice golem minion and summoned mephit to engage opponents on the ground while she uses her spectral hand to deliver touch spells from above, infusing them with her frozen caress hex. She casts wall of ice to isolate specific threats, and touch of idiocy to reduce the effectiveness of a rival spellcaster. If brought to ground, Nazhena casts ice storm or sleet storm to put difficult terrain (mitigated by her frostfoot hex) between herself and her enemies.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If reduced to 20 hit points or fewer, Nazhena tries to flee, covering her escape with sleet storm while she flies away. If cornered and unable to escape, Nazhena fights to the death rather than surrender.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>False Arcanist (Ex) A hidden priest is able to disguise her divine spellcasting as the arcane spellcasting of a sorcerer. Solveig must succeed at a Knowledge (arcana) check (DC 10 + twice the level of the spell) to disguise the spell she is casting as a sorcerer spell and successfully cast the spell. Solveig must still use any divine focus components for her spells, but she can use a symbol of Milani stitched into the palm of her glove instead of her more obvious holy symbol. A successful Spellcraft check identifies Solveig's spells as normal, but the result of the check must exceed the DC by 10 or more to recognize the spell as divine. Solveig adds half her class level (+2) on all Bluff checks to send secret messages about religious matters, Sense Motive checks to recognize similar messages, and Perception and Sense Motive checks relating to agents of the laws of Irrisen (the White Witches, mirror men, the Iron Guard, the Winter Guard, and the like). This ability replaces Solveig's 1st-level Liberation domain power.</SpecialAbilities>

    <BeforeCombat>Solveig casts endure elements and undetectable alignment every day. Before combat, she casts bull's strength and shield of faith.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Solveig uses her spells to hinder her enemies and aid her allies, engaging in melee combat only if necessary.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Solveig never abandons a friend, though if the situation seems hopeless, she does her best to persuade her allies to retreat and live to fight another day.</Morale>

    <SQ>hidey-hole</SQ>
    <Source>AP 68</Source>
    <IsTemplate>0</IsTemplate>
    <SpecialAbilities>Hidey-Hole (Su) When a kikimora chooses a house to inhabit, she can create an extradimensional space by scrawling a sigil on a wall, baseboard, cupboard, or semipermanent object (like a stove). This sigil serves as the entrance to the kikimora's tiny domain, where she can live within the house without being detected. Only the kikimora can enter this hidey-hole. Anytime after designating a hidey-hole, the kikimora can transport herself and up to 50 pounds of objects to the hidey-hole as a standard action, as long as she is in the same room as the sigil. The kikimora can exit the hidey-hole in the same way, appearing in the closest empty square to the sigil. Any objects left within the hidey-hole remain there when the kikimora exits the space, even if she removes the sigil and places it in another location. While inside the hidey-hole, the kikimora can see what is going on outside of the space through a special sensor, as if the kikimora were standing where her sigil is placed. As a result, mundane objects placed in front of the sigil can block the kikimora's sight from the hidey-hole. Zorka has scrawled her sigil in rooms throughout the Dancing Hut of Baba Yaga, allowing her to enter and exit her hidey-hole from any of the Dancing Hut's configurations. In effect, Zorka has access to every room within the Dancing Hut, even those rooms currently inaccessible because of the hut's physical location. Because multiple sigils provide access to Zorka's hidey-hole, removing one of the sigils has no effect on the hidey-hole or any creatures inside it unless all of the sigils within the Dancing Hut are removed.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Gender>Female</Gender>
    <DuringCombat>Zorka tries to avoid combat if at all possible, but she uses her spell-like abilities to hinder her attackers until she can safely flee, targeting opponents with deep slumber or pain strike. She casts break on their weapons, and uses major image to create the illusion of a more fearsome enemy for foes to face.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If reduced to 20 hit points or fewer, Zorka flees to her hidey-hole, casting summon swarm to cover her retreat.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Vile Spawn (Su) Once per month, the Black Milk Mother may, as a full-round action, give birth to its monstrous brood. When it does so, a vile, watery, black fluid spews from its body in a 10-foot radius, coating the ground as well as any creatures or objects in the area. Any creature that comes in contact with the fluid must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d4 rounds. The following round, 1d3 advanced hyenas emerge from the creature's putrid womb. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Gender>Female</Gender>
    <BeforeCombat>The Black Milk Mother begins combat chained the back wall. So long as it remains shackled, it cannot move beyond 15 feet from the chain's anchor point on the southern wall, and must wait for opponents to come within reach before striking.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>The foul creature furiously gnashes at opponents with its powerful jaws, tugging wildly at its chains. Each round, the Black Milk Mother uses its move action to try to break free (Strength DC 35) and attack. If it lasts 4 rounds while fighting the PCs, it suddenly begins convulsing. For the next 2 rounds, it fights defensively, and then gives birth to its vile spawn.</DuringCombat>

    <SpecialAbilities>Fatal Fate (Su) Once per day, Ankhazu can lay a compulsive curse upon the living, forcing them to take up her work or face a terrible end. Ankhazu can lay this curse by making a touch attack, which forces the target to attempt a DC 18 Will save; failure means being stunned for 1 round. During this round, the target receives a flood of images suggesting a course of action&amp;#8211;though it might remain vague or require research into the ghost's history to discern an exact meaning. The target has 10 days to fulfill Ankhazu's intentions. If the target does not fulfill the course of action suggested by the vision within this set period, it takes 1d4 points of Constitution drain per day. This effect can be overcome via the spell remove curse, requiring a caster level check versus DC 18. The save DC is Charisma-based. (This ghost special attack originally appeared on page 25 of Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Classic Horrors Revisited.) Rejuvenation (Su) The only way to permanently destroy Ankhazu is to cast a consecrate spell upon her mortal remains (see Development, below) and then burn them. As long as her remains exist, her spirit restores itself in 2d4 days.</SpecialAbilities>

    <Morale>Erdija's loyalty is to her clan, not to the PCs, and her first priority is to report to Korak Kaag rather than sacrifice herself for non-centaur strangers. Nevertheless, she won't abandon allies unless it's clear that the battle is lost.</Morale>

If threatened, Poryphanes casts unholy blight and fear, then fights with his natural weapons and castings of poison. If necessary, he casts summon monster III to summon a wolverine as another ally.</DuringCombat>

    <BeforeCombat>Caigreal casts undetectable alignment every day. Before meeting the PCs or before any combat, she also casts shield of faith.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Once her true form is revealed, Caigreal begins combat by casting fog cloud to buy herself enough time to bolster herself with spells like divine favor and her copycat ability. Next, she channels negative energy and targets opponents with her offensive spells. She has no qualms about engaging foes in melee combat, combining disfiguring touch or spontaneous inflict spells with her natural attacks.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If reduced to fewer than 30 hit points, Caigreal casts invisibility and flees from the combat. She heads straight for her coven sisters, first racing to the green hag Grishelmuk in area D7, then to the witchfire Silyzil in area D5, where the coven makes its final stand.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Anathema (Su) Kyrisjana has been rejected by the purity of nature. Normal plants within 20 feet wither and die if she remains in proximity for more than 5 minutes. Pure environments such as untouched forests and clear streams and ponds may become spoiled and polluted if she remains in that environment for more than 1 day. Each round that a plant creature remains within 20 feet of Kyrisjana, it must succeed at a DC 21 Fortitude save or take 1d2 points of damage. The save DC is Charisma-based. Defiling Touch (Su) A creature struck by Kyrisjana's claws takes 1d6 points of Charisma damage (Fortitude DC 22 negates), in addition to the attack's normal damage. The damage dealt by Kyrisjana's natural attacks resists all magical healing (though it can be healed normally through rest). A creature attempting to cast a cure spell or heal spell on a creature damaged by Kyrisjana's claws must succeed at a DC 22 caster level check, or the spell has no effect on the injured creature. The DC is Constitution-based, and includes a +2 racial bonus. Spells Kyrisjana casts spells as a 9th-level druid.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Gender>Female</Gender>
    <BeforeCombat>Kyrisjana casts endure elements and longstrider every day. Before combat, she casts feather step and bloody claws.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Kyrisjana emerges from the pile of wildflowers and casts stone call while her blinding beauty affects all who look at her. She casts summon nature's ally V to summon a Large air elemental, taking advantage of its whirlwind ability to increase the damage of her call lightning spell. Kyrisjana uses her stunning glance to throw her opponents off guard before attacking with her claws and defiling touch, reveling in the sensation of her enemies' blood on her bare skin.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If reduced to fewer than 25 hit points, Kyrisjana offers to surrender, promising a variety of depraved pleasures to her captors if they let her live, though she turns on those who show her mercy at the first opportunity. If her offer is rebuffed, Kyrisjana fights to the death, hurling curses at her foes.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Nymph Inspired (Su) Marislova carries a lock of hair as a token of the debased nymph Kyrisjana's affection. This lock grants Marislova a +4 insight bonus on Will saving throws, Craft checks, and Perform checks. Kyrisjana retains a link to the token and Marislova as if she had cast a status spell on her. This effect ends if Kyrisjana is slain.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Gender>Female</Gender>
    <DuringCombat>If Marislova turns violent, she uses her arcane pool to enhance her handaxe to a +1 keen handaxe as a swift action, then uses her spell combat ability to cast shield (already included in her stat bock) and attacks with her axe. She continues using spell combat to cast scorching ray and magic missile, then uses spellstrike to deliver touch spells with her attacks. After 1d4 rounds, Marislova calms a bit and becomes more rational, casting defensive spells like blur, vanish, or web to open an escape route.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Marislova is interested in her own freedom above all else. If reduced to 25 hit points or fewer, she casts vanish and tries to flee. If she's unable to escape the room or is cornered or captured, Marislova begs for execution rather than a return to her imprisonment.</Morale>

    <DuringCombat>Ratibor uses little in the way of strategy. He simply rages and attacks the nearest target within range, though he does take advantage of his rage powers&amp;#8211; particularly guarded stance and unexpected strike. He holds his ground and tries to prevent his enemies from getting past him.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If guarding the Dancing Hut, Ratibor has no choice but to fight to the death. If his opponents flee, he follows them wherever they go, but he is forbidden to exit the hut itself.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>A hobgoblin sergeant always lets his troops close with the enemy before he engages combatants. He prefers to stay out of reach while using his scorpion whip to make trip attacks, but dual-wields his longsword and whip if forced into melee.</BeforeCombat>
    <Morale>A hobgoblin sergeant has far too much pride to run or surrender. As long as at least one other hobgoblin is within sight, a hobgoblin sergeant fights to the death. If the sergeant is the last hobgoblin standing, he tries to flee if brought below 5 hit points.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>If Fethi thinks she is about to confront enemies in lethal combat, she imbibes her potion of bull's strength and takes a swig of her hobgoblin war draught. The effects of these potables have not been figured into her stat block.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Fethi always fights defensively using the crane style, giving her a &amp;#8211;2 penalty on attack rolls, but her crane style and her ranks in Acrobatics grant her a +4 dodge bonus to AC while fighting defensively. She makes all of her unarmed strikes with her feet, knees, or head, and uses her Crane Wing and Deflect Arrows feats to deflect one melee and one ranged attack per round. She mercilessly mocks all those who fail to land a blow on her.</DuringCombat>

He expects his allies to flank with him, and curses them loudly if they fail to do so.</DuringCombat>

    <DuringCombat>If surprised, Elessia casts invisibility on herself as soon as possible, then follows up with summon monster III and shield of faith. She uses charm person and other enchantment spells to garner as many weak-willed allies as possible, then channels negative energy to damage multiple foes at once (using her Quick Channel feat if she's in position to use an inflict wounds spell that round as well). Elessia heals herself with her wand whenever she falls to fewer than 15 hit points. She uses her whip only as a last resort, and relies heavily on her undead and charmed allies to defend her in melee.</DuringCombat>

    <SpecialAbilities>Cold Aura (Su) As a swift action three times per day, an ice seer can cause waves of cold to radiate from his body. This cold deals 5d6 points of cold damage to all creatures within 10 feet (Fort DC 19 half). In addition, a flurry of snow momentarily surrounds the ice seer, granting him concealment until his next turn. Ice Armor (Su) An ice seer can conjure armor of ice that grants a +8 armor bonus to AC in cold conditions. The ice seer can use this armor for 10 hours per day. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-hour increments. Icy Skin (Ex) An ice seer gains cold resistance 10. Snow Sight (Su) An ice seer can see through falling snow and sleet without taking any penalties on Perception checks as long as there is enough light for him to see normally.</SpecialAbilities>
    <BeforeCombat>The ice seer uses his ice armor revelation and casts freedom of movement and shield of faith before combat.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>The ice seer casts icy prison on anyone he catches attempting to break down or open the blockhouse door, then focuses on aiding the dragonkin with his spells and healing her when necessary. The ice seer then targets anyone else who is attempting to open the door with his offensive spells.</DuringCombat>

    <SpecialAbilities>Blizzard Breath (Su) A kokogiak's breath weapon is a polar gale so bitterly cold that it saps vigor from those it touches. Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a kokogiak can expel a 60-foot cone of blistering arctic winds, dealing 8d6 points of cold damage to all creatures struck. A successful DC 23 Reflex save halves this damage. Any creature damaged by this attack must then succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or become fatigued (or exhausted if it was already fatigued). The save DCs are Constitution-based. Forlorn Gaze (Su) As a standard action, a kokogiak can lock its black eyes on a target within 60 feet to fascinate the creature. A successful DC 20 Will save negates this effect. Creatures that fail the save are fascinated and they see the kokogiak as a lost loved one, trusted friend in danger, or ally in desperate need. Once a creature is fascinated, the kokogiak can compel the creature to move toward it. Once adjacent, the creature is flat-footed against the kokogiak's attacks, but the creature receives a new saving throw at the beginning of its turn to break the fascination. This is a mind-affecting effect and the save DC is Charisma-based. Ice Walker (Ex) A kokogiak takes no penalty to speed or on Acrobatics, Climb, or Stealth checks in snowy or icy terrain or weather conditions. It can walk across snow crusts or thin ice without breaking through. In addition, a kokogiak can choose to not leave tracks when moving in this type of terrain. Penetrating Sight (Ex) A kokogiak's sight is not affected by its own fog cloud or solid fog spell-like abilities. In addition, a kokogiak does not take any penalties on Perception checks while its snowing. Sound Imitation (Ex) A kokogiak can mimic any voice or sound it has heard by making a successful Bluff check against a listener's Sense Motive check.</SpecialAbilities>
    <DuringCombat>The kokogiak casts solid fog on the first round of combat, then uses its breath weapon against anyone trapped in the fog. With its long neck, the kokogiak can reach opponents almost anywhere in the room without needing to move through the fog.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>The kokogiak fights to the death.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>If aware of intruders in the palace, Yrax casts resist energy (acid, electricity, and fire) and see invisibility on himself. Once the alarm on the antechamber doors goes off, Yrax casts mirror image.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Yrax lets out a deafening roar and activates his frightful presence while creating a freezing fog around intruders entering the sanctum, followed by a blast of his breath weapon. Yrax casts displacement as soon as possible thereafter to protect himself against ranged attacks. Depending on the tactics of those facing him, Yrax might swoop over opponents and use Flyby Attack and Greater Vital Strike with his bite attacks. If brought to fewer than 125 hit points, Yrax lands and makes full attacks against his most troublesome foe.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Here at the seat of his power, Yrax considers retreat only when reduced to 40 hit points or fewer, and then only if he has a good chance of getting away.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Battleflower (Ex) Because of her training as an ukara, Cesseer is proficient with all weapons with the performance weapon quality and treats all such weapons as monk weapons for the purposes of feats and the flurry of blows special ability. This replaces the normal monk weapon proficiencies.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Gender>Female</Gender>
    <BeforeCombat>Cesseer activates her barkskin ki power before combat or before entering the fighting pit. If in an area of difficult terrain (such as ice), she also activates her feather step ki power.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>In a nonlethal or exhibition combat, Cesseer uses Dazzling Display in the first round to demoralize her opponent, allowing her to use Shatter Defenses and make extra attacks with Medusa's Wrath. She uses Stage Combatant to make nonlethal attacks with her shotel and Perfect Strike to ensure success, and uses Punishing Kick, Stunning Fist, and trip combat maneuvers to keep her opponent at a disadvantage. In a real (lethal) fight, Cesseer spends a ki point each round to gain an extra attack if she can make a full attack, or to improve her AC (if she can't).</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Honor is fundamental to Cesseer, and if fighting in a nonlethal duel, she yields when reduced to 20 hit points or fewer. In a lethal combat against honorable foes, Cesseer fights to the end. If revived afterward, she surrenders and allows herself be taken prisoner. If the PCs shamefully interrupt or interfere in a one-on-one combat, Cesseer uses her abundant step ability to retreat to Yrax's sanctum (area D20) and fights at his side.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>Commander Pharamol casts barkskin and effortless armor before any combat, and he casts aspect of the falcon and gravity bow before engaging foes at range (already included in his stats).</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>In a pitched battle, Commander Pharamol uses his hunter's bond to aid his troops as necessary. When fighting dangerous creatures who aren't one of his favored enemies, Pharamol casts instant enemy and declares a particular foe as his quarry, then focuses his attacks on that opponent, casting resist energy as needed depending on the nature of his foe. Pharamol relies on missile combat, but if necessary, he draws his bastard sword and readies an action to attack while his dragonkin partner Amerenth makes Flyby Attacks.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If fighting against spies or assassins, Commander Pharamol retreats to gather reinforcements if reduced to 50 hit points or fewer. In a battle to defend Spurhorn, however, Pharamol fights to the bitter end.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Shears (Su) Yrldak's shears function as a +5 keen scimitar when she wields them, instead of as a +5 mithral keen speed scimitar like the shears wielded by fully grown norns. Sister Seeking (Su) An immature norn separated from her sisters has an innate ability to locate them across any distance on the same plane. The norn can sense when she is facing in the direction of one or both of her sisters, as well as in which direction they are moving. This sense does not grant a norn the ability to assess distance to her sisters. Once the norn rejoins one or both of her sisters, she loses this ability.</SpecialAbilities>

    <SpecialAbilities>Evil Eye (Su) Three times per day, the Kallas Devil can cast its dire gaze upon any single creature within 30 feet. The target must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or be staggered as a strange nebulous distress and a gnawing sense of impending doom plague the victim. If the Kallas Devil uses its evil eye on someone already afflicted by this curse, the victim must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or be overwhelmed with fright and collapse into a comatose state for 3 days. Each day that passes, the comatose victim must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or perish. The evil eye is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DCs are Charisma-based. Evil Eye Curse: Gaze&amp;#8211;failed save; save Will DC 20; frequency 1/day; effect staggered (or fall comatose if already under the effects of the evil eye).</SpecialAbilities>

    <BeforeCombat>Each cultist casts misdirection on themselves when they wake each evening, targeting their daggers. They cast mage armor soon after they set out for the mine each night, or as soon as they suspect combat is imminent.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>If the cultists get in a fight, one of them attempts to escape while the other three hold the PCs off. The escaping cultist uses a scroll of invisibility to aid his escape, then a scroll of phantom steed to quickly reach the Nesher Mines to warn Abtaroh&amp;#8211;this cultist can be encountered later at that location. The remaining cultists attempt to charm the PCs on the first round, hoping to stop combat before it begins. Failing this, one of the cultists uses summon monster spells while the other two use their scrolls of fireball if there's room. One cultist readies actions each round to launch magic missiles at foes as they cast spells if they are strong spellcasters or healers. A cultist uses vampiric touch as soon as possible after he's wounded, and drinks a potion of cure moderate wounds if brought to fewer than 15 hit points.</DuringCombat>

    <BeforeCombat>Although Sonarisa's intellect is a shadow of what it once was, her religious habits die hard. Her daily prayers still include a casting of magic vestment, and as soon as she fears combat is nearing (as is the case if she notices an approaching light source or hears the traps in area C2 activate), she casts shield of faith on herself.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>For the first few rounds of combat, Sonarisa casts summon monster spells to summon creatures to attack her foes in melee. She switches to her bow once the odds are evened, pausing to cast sanctuary if she's brought below 30 hit points so she can heal her wounds in peace.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Sonarisa fights to the death unless the PCs show her one of the planet spheres from the orrery of distant worlds, in which case she stops fighting and reacts as detailed under Development, below.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>Abtaroh casts endure elements, false life, mage armor, misdirection (onto her dagger), shield, and unseen servant before combat.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Abtaroh tries to keep her cultist followers between herself and the enemy, casting black tentacles to prevent the PCs from approaching. She uses her wand of mirror image as soon as it appears that she'll be in melee combat or is otherwise targeted by attacks. Abtaroh would prefer to capture the PCs alive, and uses charm person to help secure their alliance&amp;#8211;she hopes to use the PCs to investigate the crash site, and whether they do so as charmed minions or beaten foes who have bargained for their lives matters little to her.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Abtaroh casts dimension door if reduced to fewer than 20 hit points, fleeing to the surface above. She then casts beast shape I to assume the shape of an eagle and flies to Dustpawn&amp;#8211;she's never been seen in town, so she can resume her true form once there to go into hiding. When the Emissary arrives, Abtaroh comes out of hiding to present herself to the alien creature. Unfortunately for her, the Emissary has no more use for her at this point and attacks Abtaroh, perhaps giving the PCs a round or two of respite before it turns its attention to them.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>Gelviel casts mage armor and false life every day, extending them with his metamagic mastery ability. As soon as he hears combat elsewhere in the ship, he casts bear's endurance, stoneskin, and shield to prepare for battle.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Gelviel's first act in combat is to flee to the bow of the ship and cast repulsion, shrieking for the "treacherous mutineers" to "stay away!" He follows this up by casting summon monster V to conjure 1d3 Medium air elementals, after which he casts displacement. He follows this up with his ranged attack spells, trusting his elementals to keep foes from entering melee with him. If he is forced into melee, he uses his wand of vampiric touch.</DuringCombat>

    <SpecialAbilities>Aura of Madness (Su) Any creature within a 60-foot radius of the vespergaunt must succeed at a DC 21 Will save or be confused for 1d4 rounds. Once a creature successfully saves, it cannot be affected by the Emissary's aura again for 24 hours. As a free action, the Emissary can suppress its aura. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. Damage Reduction (Su) The vespergaunt's DR is bypassed by any weapons that are chaos-, evil-, good-, or law-aligned. Siphon Spirit (Su) Any creature touched by the Emissary from Beyond must succeed at a DC 21 Will save or gain 1 negative level as the Emissary rips away a portion of its soul. A divine spellcaster gains an additional negative level with each failed save. The victim must save anew each time it is touched, and a character killed by this attack disintegrates completely except for its eyes and strands of brain matter, which become part of the Emissary. Only powerful magic such as miracle or wish can resurrect a creature slain in this manner.</SpecialAbilities>
    <DuringCombat>The vespergaunt has already used its greatest weapon (its monthly wish) to trigger the unnatural twilight and transformations in the Dustpawn environs, but it is still a dangerous foe. It begins combat by casting deeper darkness and tries to remain in the spell's area at all times if possible, but as it has no ranged options in combat, it can be lured out of the darkness by forcing it to exit the spell's area to make attacks. The monster focuses its attacks on divine spellcasters.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>After traveling for so long to reach its destination, the alien does not consider flight or surrender to be a viable option. It fights to the death, even if it's been crippled by the destruction of the orrery of distant worlds.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Fusillade (Ex) Rifle troops can fire a fusillade of rifle bullets as a standard action. This attack takes the form of up to four lines with a range of 200 feet. These lines can start from the corner of any square in the troop's space. All creatures in one of these lines' areas of effect take 6d10+6 points of bludgeoning and piercing damage (Reflex DC 23 for half). The save DC is Dexterity-based, and includes the bonus from the troop's Ability Focus feat. Gas Masks (Ex) The soldiers of a rifle troop are all equipped with gas masks. This makes the troop immune to inhaled poisons and other nonmagical airborne attacks that require breathing, and grants it a +2 bonus on saving throws against magical cloud or gas attacks. Grenade Volley (Ex) Rifle troops are equipped with grenades. As a move action, a rifle troop can target a single square up to 60 feet away with a volley of fragmentation grenades. A volley deals 12d6 points of piercing and slashing damage in a 30-foot-radius burst (Reflex DC 21 for half). The save DC is Dexterity-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <DuringCombat>These troops are veterans of the Great War, and even when faced with fantastic foes (such as armored, sword-wielding, or spellcasting PCs), these hardened soldiers maintain a steely resolve, concentrating their rifle fusillades on flying opponents or supernatural threats, or readying actions to launch grenade volleys at charging opponents. In the absence of armor, troops seek any scrap of cover they can earn&amp;#8211;particularly trenches, fortifications, and walls.</DuringCombat>

    <SpecialAbilities>Trench Warfare (Ex) Starting at 3rd level, a trench fighter can select one specific type of firearm (such as a machine gun, revolver, or rif le). He gains a bonus equal to his Dexterity modifier on damage rolls when firing that type of firearm. Every 4 levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), the trench fighter picks up another type of firearm, gaining these bonuses for those types as well. Furthermore, when behind partial, normal, or improved cover, a trench fighter gains an additional +2 AC bonus from the cover. This ability replaces armor training 1, 2, 3, and 4.</SpecialAbilities>

    <SpecialAbilities>Absorb Body (Su) A corpse orgy can absorb the physical body of any creature it has reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by moving over it and remaining in contact with it for at least 1 full round. An unconscious or dying opponent can attempt a DC 26 Fortitude save to prevent the absorption. A dead opponent gets no saving throw. The save DC is Constitution-based. When it absorbs a body, the corpse orgy gains 12 temporary hit points. A creature whose body is absorbed can only be raised or resurrected if the corpse orgy that absorbed its body is slain and the corpse in question is recovered. Pain Shriek (Su) Twice per day as a standard action, a corpse orgy can unleash a piercing shriek from the various heads captured in its form. This shriek deals 10d6 points of sonic damage to all creatures in a 40-foot radius (Fortitude DC 22 for half). Creatures that cannot hear do not take this damage. The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>

    <SpecialAbilities>Danse Macabre (Su) Once per night, a tombstone fairy can invoke a ritual to raise any evil creature from the dead. The ritual takes 10 minutes to perform and the target cannot have been dead longer than 1 day per Hit Die of the tombstone fairy. Additionally, the target's body must be present during the ritual and its soul must be available for return (if the target's soul is trapped, such as by a trap the soul spell, this ritual automatically fails). A target unwilling to return to life can try to prevent its raising by attempting an opposed Charisma check against the tombstone fairy's Charisma check. If the tombstone fairy wins the opposed check, the target's soul is forced into its body and it returns to life. If the target wins the opposed check, it prevents its raising, and the tombstone fairy cannot attempt to raise that target for 1 month. During the ritual, a portion of the target's soul transfers to its funeral shroud or cloth. The tombstone fairy often retains this shroud so as to force compliance from the returned target. Once the target does what the fairy desires, the tombstone fairy finishes this ritual and transfers the last bit of the target's soul from the shroud into its body. If the funeral shroud is destroyed while it contains a part of the target's soul, the target instantly dies and can only be returned to life through the use of a miracle, resurrection, true resurrection, or wish. This ability otherwise resembles a raise dead spell. A tombstone fairy can have only one funeral shroud containing a target's soul in its possession at one time.</SpecialAbilities>

    <SpecialAbilities>Fear Light (Su) A lantern goat can emit an ugly yellow light from the lantern around its neck as a free action. All creatures within 60 feet that view this light must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or be panicked for 1d4+4 rounds. A creature that succeeds at its save is immune to the fear light of that lantern goat for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based. Soul Capture (Su) Any living creature reduced to fewer than 0 hit points while within 60 feet of a lantern goat must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or have its soul drawn into the lantern goat's lantern. The DC increases by 1 for every hit point the character is below 0 (e.g., a character at &amp;#8211;3 hit points must succeed at a DC 25 save). As long as the lantern contains at least one soul, the lantern goat gains channel resistance +4 and fast healing 10. Once a soul is captured, the slain creature cannot be returned to life through raise dead, reincarnation, resurrection, true resurrection, or even wish or miracle. Only by destroying the lantern can the soul be freed, at which point such spells work normally. The lantern cannot be destroyed or removed until the lantern goat is destroyed. The save DC is Charisma-based. The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>

    <SpecialAbilities>Crucify Soul (Su) Five times per day, a crucifixion spirit can attempt a ranged touch attack to crucify the soul of a single living target within 60 feet. If the attack is successful, the target's soul is ripped from its body, which collapses in a heap on the ground. Although the victim is not dead, the target's soul appears as a ghostly copy of the victim superimposed over the body of the dead soldier crucified on the door, held in place by translucent spikes or nails. The victim cries out silently in pain, and is visible to all those viewing it. A crucified soul cannot be attacked or affected by anything, cannot take any actions (other than trying to escape; see below), and experiences excruciating pain that deals 2 negative levels to it in the round it is crucified, and 1 negative level each round thereafter. A successful DC 25 Fortitude save is required to remove a negative level. A crucifixion spirit does not need to concentrate on this ability for it to continue to affect a target, and the crucifixion spirit can direct attacks against different opponents. A creature whose soul is crucified can try to escape each round by attempting a DC 25 Will save. If the save is successful, the creature's soul is freed from its torment and returns to its body in the same round. The creature is stunned for 1 round, but can act normally afterward. A creature slain with this ability cannot be returned to life except through the casting of a wish, miracle, or true resurrection spell. The save DCs are Charisma-based. Immunity to Channel Energy (Su) A crucifixion spirit takes no damage from the channel energy ability, and is not affected by effects that mimic channel energy or are based on the channel energy ability (such as Turn Undead and Command Undead).</SpecialAbilities>
    <DuringCombat>The crucifixion spirit attempts to crucify the souls of as many opponents as it can, using its incorporeal touch to paralyze those foes who initially resist. In melee, it uses Combat Expertise to gain an additional +4 dodge bonus to its AC.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>The crucifixion spirit fights until destroyed.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Object of Desire (Su) While using its detect thoughts ability, an erodaemon can see into the mind of a humanoid and identify the person the target most desires, whether it be a lost loved one or an object of lust. As a full-round action, the erodaemon can change into the form of this desired person as long as the target is a Small, Medium, or Large humanoid. The erodaemon gains a +20 bonus on its Disguise and Bluff checks to impersonate that person and avoid being detected as a fraud, but spells like true seeing negate this effect as normal. This effect ends if the erodaemon attacks any creature. Actions that could reveal the erodaemon as a fraud (such as performing an action that the imitated person would obviously not do, like cast a spell or speak Infernal) require the erodaemon to attempt an immediate Bluff check to continue the impersonation, with the erodaemon losing some or all of its bonus depending on the severity of the breach (GM's discretion). Wilting Kiss (Su) An erodaemon can draw a mortal into a state of obsession with its kiss. An unwilling victim must be grappled before the erodaemon can use this ability. A creature affected by this kiss must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or become obsessed with the erodaemon, an obsession the erodaemon feeds on. Each round the target is more than 30 feet away from the erodaemon, it must attempt an additional DC 25 Will save. Failing the save means that the sheer pain of her absence deals 1 point of Charisma drain to the subject that round. Succeeding at the Will save two consecutive times ends the effects of this ability. Spells such as dispel magic and break enchantment end this effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>

    <DuringCombat>Unable to summon ceustodaemon allies inside the chapel's forbiddance effect, Serafina casts quickened crushing despair and unnatural lust on her foes, then attempts to grapple an unaffected character to give it a wilting kiss. If hard pressed, she defends herself with enervation, her claws, and snake-tail bite.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Serafina attempts to flee to Rasputin's side in area H6 if reduced to fewer than 90 hit points. If cornered, however, she fights to the death.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Blood Drain (Ex) A nosferatu can suck blood from a living victim with its fangs by making a successful grapple check. If it pins the foe, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution and Wisdom drain each round the pin is maintained. On each such successful attack, the nosferatu gains 5 temporary hit points. Damage Reduction (Ex) A nosferatu has damage reduction 5/ wood and piercing (this includes all wood-shafted weapons like arrows, crossbow bolts, spears, and javelins, even if the weapon's head is made of another material). Dominate (Su) This functions as the vampire ability of the same name (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 271). Spider Climb (Ex) This functions as the vampire ability of the same name (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 271). Swarm Form (Su) As a standard action, a nosferatu can change into a bat swarm, centipede swarm, rat swarm, or spider swarm. The swarm has the same number of hit points as the nosferatu. While in swarm form, a nosferatu cannot use its claw attacks or any of its special attacks. It retains its defensive abilities and special qualities, and counts as an undead creature. It gains the natural weapons and extraordinary special attacks of the swarm it transformed into and can use any of the swarm's abilities and defenses. It can remain in swarm form until it assumes another form or until the next sunrise. Telekinesis (Su) As a standard action, a nosferatu can use telekinesis (caster level 12th).</SpecialAbilities>

    <BeforeCombat>The Brothers Three prepare themselves by casting bull's strength, eagle's splendor, defile armor, and protection from good, and use their fiendish boon ability to make their claws +1 unholy weapons. In addition, they are under the effects of the erodaemon Serafina's desecrate spell in this area.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>The nosferatu brothers flank opponents and use their smite good ability on the biggest apparent threat. They make liberal use of their touch of corruption ability to harm and nauseate opponents, and use it or channeled negative energy to heal one another as needed.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If reduced to fewer than 30 hit points, the nosferatus retreat behind Rasputin's antilife shell in area H6 to allow their fast healing to take over. If reduced to 0 hit points, a nosferatu assumes bat swarm form and flees to its coffin in the eastern bell tower (area H4b).</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Stitched Soul (Su) Rasputin's soul is stitched to his body with threads of fate, and he clings tenaciously to life. He gains Diehard as a bonus feat. In addition, when first reduced to a number of negative hit points equal to or greater than his current Con score, Rasputin dies, but he springs back to life 1d4 rounds later as if the target of a resurrection spell. If killed a second time, the Mad Monk again comes back to life 1d6 rounds later, as if the target of a raise dead spell (upon his return, he loses 50% of his remaining unused spell slots as if they had been used to cast spells). Only after Rasputin is slain for a third time do his soul's stitches finally unravel from his corpse, releasing his malignant spirit into the ether.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Gender>Male</Gender>
    <BeforeCombat>Within the Thrice-Tenth presbytery (area H6), Rasputin enjoys the benefits of the World Engine's unholy aura and insight bonus to his AC. When faced with combat, Rasputin activates his ectoplasmic armor revelation and casts entropic shield, freedom of movement, levitate, moment of prescience, and true seeing. Once enemies are in sight, he casts antilife shell and spectral hand to enable him to use touch attacks beyond the field's perimeter.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Under the protection of his antilife shell, Rasputin attempts to hinder opponents with reverse gravity and waves of ecstasy and turn foes against each other with terrible remorse and murderous command, before laying waste with such deadly effects as blade barrier, blasphemy, destruction, harm, stormbolts, and unholy blight. If wounded, Rasputin casts quickened cure spells while continuing to target enemies with offensive spells.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>On the precipice of claiming his mother's mythic power, Rasputin relies on his stitched soul to preserve his life, and fights to the death again and again until slain permanently.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Nightmare Mount (Su) As a standard action, Lavrenti can summon a nightmare (Bestiary 216) as a mount. This nightmare remains until it is slain or Lavrenti dismisses it. He can only have one such nightmare in his service at a time.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Gender>Male</Gender>
    <DuringCombat>Lavrenti typically relies on a clever mixture of aggressive melee lance or scimitar attacks from atop his charging mount and ranged harassment with his revolver, taking full advantage of his gunslinger abilities. He uses his targeting ability to disarm foes, followed by utility shots to scoot their weapons out of reach before his nightmare mount tramples the disarmed opponents. Against opponents behind cover, he uses his dimensional grenades. If threatened by one whose name he knows, Lavrenti uses the target's name to take full advantage of his death's calling ability.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Though unafraid of death, Lavrenti does not wish to face it again so soon, and makes use of his mount's flight or plane shift ability to retreat from ambush or surprise, returning to meet opponents on his own diabolical terms.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>Aashaq requires little in the way of preparation, but she will cast resist energy (cold) if she expects to be threatened by evocation magic. She uses her cleric spells to control enemies or to prepare herself for those exceptionally rare fights in which she expects difficulties.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Aashaq lives to destroy. She will not engage in diplomacy unless she finds she cannot end her enemies swiftly. Even then she will only use discussion to learn about her foes before launching another attack. She savors the visceral, tactile joy of tearing her foes apart, using quickened spells to confound enemies along with her claws and teeth. She knows few can challenge her, so she is not afraid to spend all of her power on those who do.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Aashaq will fight to the death, but is not completely reckless. If reduced to 75% of her hit points, she uses wall of force to separate her foes and deal with them one at a time. If reduced to 50% of her hit points she casts antimagic field, relying on her natural bulk and armor to deal with enemies who are otherwise benefitting from multiple spells and enchantments.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>When preparing for violence, the wyrmlings leverage their strengths. Sirocco positions herself up high while Scorpion seeks a hiding spot (usually under the sand). In the meantime, Inferno attempts to draw attention to himself with trumpeting challenge-roars and gouts of fire.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>In combat, the wyrmlings focus on one foe at a time. Inferno opens with his breath weapon and attacks, hoping to give his clutchmates easy access to flank their foes.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>When given the opportunity, the wyrmlings flee. Sirocco covers the retreat of her brothers from the air, using her breath weapon to allow her to keep her distance from threats.</Morale>

    <DuringCombat>Enyi always fights the strongest-looking foe that has not been made shaken. Washiyeh is a cruel bully and prefers to target foes who seem weak. Both half-dragons usually wait until they can line up two or more enemies before using their lightning breath.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>As long as Fatima is not in danger, Enyi and Washiyeh take wing to escape if the situation goes badly. If she is present, one of the two will snatch her up and flee while the other stays behind to draw attacks before fleeing as well.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>Should evil intruders threaten her lair, Eranex casts protection from evil on herself, then hides in a concealed position behind a crag or in a remote cavern chamber. Her various draconic and fey-granted spell-like abilities make evasion easy, and she does her best to stay hidden from would-be assassins until she can lay them low with a single surprise blow.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Eranex is prepared for battle with both undead and humanoid intruders, casting spells such as disrupt undead or halt undead to deal with the former and breathing gouts of cold against other foes. Fey present more of a problem, but Eranex is not afraid to go toe to toe with these capricious enemies by first casting bull's strength and then hurling herself into melee.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Eranex knows she must attempt to fulfill Shyka's demands, but realizes death would be an even worse fate. If reduced to fewer than 30 hit points, she retreats to plot her retaliatory strike.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>Fahrauth is typically alerted to the presence of enemies by his minions. He often sizes up his opponents remotely using project image. Once he determines the nature of the threat, he then bolsters himself by using limited wish to recreate a protective spell suitable for his foes.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Fahrauth opens combat against living creatures with his breath weapon. If space permits, he hovers above his enemies, casting spells between uses of his breath weapon. If he's feeling especially confident, he lands near his foes and finishes them off with his melee attacks. He sticks close to the gate to the Negative Energy Plane to receive constant healing from its emanations.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Arrogant and unafraid of dying so close to the gate, Fahrauth fights to the death if encountered in his lair.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>Garaudhilyx abhors violence and first tries to subdue even the most evil opponents without causing injury. If he believes a creature significantly threatens innocents&amp;#8211;or if his allies are placed in harm's way&amp;#8211; he unleashes his full fury to put an end to the evil. When combat is unavoidable, Garaudhilyx employs time stop to raise his defensive and offensive capabilities, using quickened spells as necessary to maximize the efficiency of his time stop spell.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Ever the pacifist, Garaudhilyx accepts any foe's unconditional surrender during battle. When the dragon's enemies do not relent, Garaudhilyx often injures them terribly and then uses his powerful healing magic to prevent their deaths, choosing to imprison them on Valkus Isle instead.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Garaudhilyx is steadfast in the face of evil, and only retreats if reduced to fewer than a quarter his total hit points. When reduced to half his total hit points, he casts time stop and uses the time to heal himself and augment his defenses (either restoring dispelled abjurations or changing his tactics based on his enemy's arsenal).</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Ectoplasmic Breath (Su) After becoming a ghost, Maghara learned to use his iconic breath weapon, albeit with a slight difference. His breath weapon now produces a line of ectoplasm that deals force damage instead of acid damage.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Gender>Male</Gender>
    <BeforeCombat>Maghara prefers to observe invisibly to assess potential threats. He uses ghost sound, silent image, phantom trap, and telekinesis to scare off intruders. If he expects conflict, he casts shield to protect against magic missiles (which can harm even a ghost).</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Maghara relies on his incorporeal nature to protect him against most forms of harm. He initiates combat by using hideous laughter and telekinesis to deal with foes, using his corrupting touch only if needed, or against truly evil opponents.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Already a ghost, Maghara fears little, although he will use his incorporeal traits and invisibility to escape a losing battle, knowing that his work in the world is not yet done. Though he is careful to not be "destroyed," he knows his rejuvenation ability will bring him back after a time.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>Moschabbatt never enters battle without mage armor, and if he's aware of incoming danger, he will also cast shield and resist energy (cold). If he has not been spotted, he likes to enter engagements under the cover of invisibility.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Moschabbatt prefers to face foes above the lava lake, stripping them of their fire resistance and magical flight using dispel magic (often quickened). He then blinds ranged combatants, and blasts the rest with cold spells before switching to electricity and acid.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If reduced to 20% of his hit points, Moschabbatt will parley. However, if his enemies are after the Axe of the Dwarvish Lords, he will teleport or dimension door to his vault, use heal while there, and return to fight to the death.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>In an effort to keep the exact location of her lair hidden from outsiders, Rezlarabren often patrols its outskirts, hoping to preemptively strike against enemies. If she sees a viking ship or detects the presence of a dragonslayer, she casts invisibility to approach undetected.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Once she has initially wounded her quarries with an initial attack using aqueous orb, sleet storm, or her breath weapon (if her foes were lined up for such an attack), Rezlarabren fights with a furious vengeance, targeting a single opponent at a time until all her enemies are dead, only relenting if surrounded. She prefers to fight while hovering to make such brief retreats possible, but isn't afraid to alight on a ship's deck if it means she can more quickly dispatch her foes.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If reduced to fewer than half of her hit points, Rezlarabren attempts to escape and return to her lair. However, if fighting vikings from the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, she becomes more enraged with each successive wound and fights fiercely to the death if necessary.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>If made aware of threats to her servants, Seryzilian moves into the depths of Adderpool and watches from the safety of the murky water. There she casts haste, displacement, and mage armor, then uses her acid pool ability to undetectably taint the surface of the water. Only if battle turns against Lesaul and her followers does Seryzilian emerge.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Seryzilian prefers to keep foes off balance by using darkness or dimension door, disappearing beneath the water, or attempting to lure enemies onto marshy ground&amp;#8211;or perhaps create it using transmute rock to mud.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>The black dragon retreats to her lair, calling upon the aid of her green hag and reptilian allies, if reduced to fewer than half her hit points. If confronted there, she fights to the death.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>Sjohvor casts alarm on the entrances to his cave every day. If he sees or is alerted to an imminent attack, he casts resist energy (fire) on himself, as well as mage armor, mirror image, and shield.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Sjohvor prefers to be airborne when he battles others. He uses fog cloud, wall of ice, and wall of force to split his foes before swooping in to snatch one of the enemies. On the ground, he engages in melee, using his breath weapon when available.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If reduced to fewer than half his full normal hit points, Sjohvor calls on either his harpy or centaur allies (whichever are closest). He then flees to his lair in the distraction. If particularly strong foes face him, he calls for Thragandor to join his defense. If confronted in his lair, he fights to the death to protect his hoard.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>If planning a raid on a slave ship, Sonthonax often outfits his humanoid allies with air bubble and touch of the sea to give them more freedom in the water.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Sonthonax prefers to fight from both air and sea, diving beneath the waves, then erupting over the side of a ship and strafing the vessel with his breath weapon. He often uses his repulsion at the helm of the ship to force the pilot and any crew away from the wheel, rendering the ship uncontrolled.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If reduced to a quarter of his hit points, Sonthonax removes himself from battle. He presses on longer if lives are at stake, including those of the slaves he hopes to free and his own allies.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>Toishihebi uses charm monster to gain an upper hand whenever possible. He tries to scout out enemies first with arcane eye, and attacks only if the odds are favorable. When possible, he hides inside a fog cloud and uses his blindsight to direct his breath weapon. As Hiyuke, he sometimes tries to trick samurai with his keen edge spell, mimicking the sharpening of their blade with a "magic" whetstone and selling this service as a permanent effect.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>In the open, Toishihebi tries to stay away from melee combat, using his breath weapon and spells as much as possible. He retreats once his spells are depleted, unless he thinks he can finish his enemies in a hand-to-hand fight. When posing as Hiyuke, he prefers to flee from superior foes rather than reveal his true nature.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Toishihebi withdraws if he cannot defeat his foes. He fights to the bitter end only in defense of his hoard.</Morale>

In combat, she uses her bow to strike down foes from a great distance, taking to melee only as a last resort.

    <SpecialAbilities>Clockwork Augmentations (Ex) Because of the various mechanical parts fused to Cvotgar's body, his ability scores are built using 20 points. In addition, these augmentations grant him a number of unique abilities. Altogether, these augmentations increase Cvotgar's CR by 1. Mechanical Jaw: Cvotgar's metal jaw grants him a powerful bite attack that deals 2d6 points of damage and threatens a critical hit on rolls of 19&amp;#8211;20. Special tubes that run the length of his throat allow Cvotgar to use blood drain as a free action on a successful critical hit with his bite attack, regardless of whether he has established or is maintaining a pin that round. Mithral Legs: Cvotgar's mechanical legs increase his base speed by 10 feet. Once per minute, Cvotgar can sprint up to two times his base speed as a move action, and doesn't need to move in a straight line when sprinting. Tri-Scythe Blades: Whenever Cvotgar attacks with a flurry of blows, he can use the adamantine blades jutting from his forearms to deal an additional 1d6 points of slashing damage as long as he hits with at least one attack from his flurry. This extra damage is not multiplied on a critical hit. In addition, the blades grant him a +4 bonus on combat maneuvers to disarm opponents.</SpecialAbilities>

    <SpecialAbilities>Madness (Ex) Derros use their Charisma modifier on Will saves instead of their Wisdom modifier, and are immune to insanity and confusion effects. Only a miracle or wish can remove a derro's madness. If this occurs, the derro gains 6 points of Wisdom and loses 6 points of Charisma. Poison Use (Ex) Derros are not at risk of poisoning themselves when handling poison. They use Medium spider venom to poison their crossbow bolts, and generally carry 10 prepoisoned bolts at all times. Poison (Ex) Weapon&amp;#8211;injury; save Fort DC 14; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d2 Strength damage; cure 1 save. Vulnerability to Sunlight (Ex) A derro takes 1 point of Con damage after every hour it is exposed to sunlight.</SpecialAbilities>

    <DuringCombat>The derro commander prefers to fight from range, and uses her hide in plain sight ability. If she becomes overmatched on the platform, she uses her darkness at will ability. Once concealed within the darkness, she flees to the safety of the room's edge farthest from the bulk of the PCs. Next she uses ghost sound to trick the PCs into believing she is still within the sphere of darkness. Once more she hides and uses sound burst or her crossbow to attack her foes. Otherwise, she isolates her foes and uses sneak attack.</DuringCombat>

    <SpecialAbilities>Staggered (Ex) Zombies have poor reflexes and can only perform a single move action or standard action each round. A zombie can move up to its speed and attack in the same round as a charge action. Zyphus Rot (Su) When a Zyphus zombie kills a living creature and feeds on it, the zombie passes on a magical disease called Zyphus rot that causes the victim to quickly animate and rise as a zombie in 1d4 minutes. Once risen, the new zombie no longer carries Zyphus rot and can't pass it to another living creature. A corpse can be "cured" of Zyphus rot by receiving a cure disease spell prior to reanimation. A Zyphus zombie cannot be cured of the disease unless the artifact that caused it is destroyed. Any creature with more than 10 HD is immune to the effects of Zyphus rot. Zyphus rot only affects corporeal creatures (other than undead) that have a skeletal system.</SpecialAbilities>
    <BeforeCombat>The zombie stands in the northeast hallway of the crypt. Once he hears the PCs, he moves down the 10-foot-wide hallway toward A2, but stops at the pit (T3). Having already stepped into the pit once, he knows not to try to cross it.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Should the PCs spot the zombie and ignore him, he wanders north and comes at the PCs from another angle (he will not cross T3). He attacks the first PC he sees and mindlessly bludgeons her until she's unconscious before shifting to the next nearest PC.</DuringCombat>

    <DuringCombat>Should the PCs spot the zombie and ignore him, he wanders north and comes at the PCs from another angle (he will not cross T3). He attacks the first PC he sees and mindlessly bludgeons her until she's unconscious before shifting to the next nearest PC.</DuringCombat>

    <SpecialAbilities>Fear (Su) A creature hit by a thrown object must succeed on a DC 12 Will save or flee in terror for 2d6 rounds. A creature that successfully saves is immune to the fear effect of the same poltergeist for the remainder of the encounter. The save DC is Charisma-based. Telekinesis (Su) A poltergeist can create a telekinetic effect to hurl one object or creature within 10 feet a distance of 60 feet (no range increment). This ability functions as the telekinesis spell (caster level 6th) with the following exceptions: the poltergeist does not have to concentrate to use or maintain this ability, the poltergeist can hurl only one object or creature per round, and the poltergeist uses its Charisma modifier to modify its base attack bonus. A creature targeted by this ability can make a DC 12 Will save to avoid being hurled by the poltergeist. The save DC is Charisma-based. Natural Invisibility (Su) This ability is constant, allowing a poltergeist to remain invisible even when attacking. This ability is inherent, cannot be dispelled or negated, and is not subject to the invisibility purge spell. Unnatural Aura (Su) Both wild and domesticated animals can sense the unnatural presence of a poltergeist at a distance of 30 feet. They will not willingly approach nearer than that and panic if forced to do so; they remain panicked as long as they are within that range.</SpecialAbilities>
    <DuringCombat>The poltergeist spends most of the combat flying above the bridge throwing 25-pound rocks at the PCs (1d6 damage). Once all or most of all of the PCs are on the bridge, he swoops down and triggers the bridge's collapse, sending the PCs tumbling into the pit (see bridge collapse trap below). Any PCs not in the pit are then targeted with telekinesis (combat maneuver) as the poltergeist attempts to push them in. Once all of the PCs are in the pit, he resumes throwing rocks at them. To mitigate the difficulty of this encounter, the poltergeist's only accessible rocks heavy enough to do damage to the PCs are in a single pile near the three corpses in the pit. The poltergeist has to swoop down to pick one up and the PCs should get a DC 11 Perception check to spot him picking up a rock.</DuringCombat>

    <SpecialAbilities>Aura of Misfortune (Su) Every creature within 10 feet of a fortune-spurned creature gains the diminished criticals and unlucky strike special qualities of the fortune-spurned template as long as it remains within range. Furthermore, each such creature takes a &amp;#8211; 4 penalty on all of its checks and saving throws. Calamitous Mishap (Su) As a free action once per encounter, a fortune-spurned creature can cause some calamity to befall itself and another creature within 5 feet of it. The mishap selected must be a possible result of normal circumstances, but it can be the worst possible result. For instance, lightning could strike both the fortune-spurned creature and its foe on a cloudy day, or it could strike a tree, causing a heavy limb to fall on both targets, but lightning could not strike out of a clear sky. Alternatively, ropes holding up some scaffolding might break, the lock on a portcullis might slip, or the floor of a ruined keep might give way. In some cases, the fortune-spurned creature might be unable to cause any calamity given its surroundings. A calamity cannot affect anyone other than the fortune-spurned creature and a single adjacent creature of its choice. Nearly any natural misfortune may be chosen, but it must be one that is as dangerous to the fortune-spurned creature as it is to the other creature. Both targets must be affected equally&amp;#8211;that is, both must make the same saving throw and suffer the same result. Thus, if the fortune-spurned creature is immune or resistant to electricity, it could not choose to have lightning strike both it and its foe unless the foe is equally resistance to electricity. Cursed (Ex) A fortune-spurned creature takes a &amp;#8211; 2 luck penalty on all opposed checks and saves, and a &amp;#8211;1 luck penalty on all attack rolls. These penalties are already figured into the creature's stats. Diminished Criticals (Ex) A fortune-spurned creature must roll twice to confirm a critical hit. Twist of Fate (Su) The first time in any given day that a fortunespurned creature rolls a natural 20 on a saving throw, it fails the save. This twist of fate happens only once per day. Unlucky Strike (Su) When a fortune-spurned creature attacks with a weapon and rolls a natural 1, it drops the weapon unless it can make a successful Reflex save (DC 9). If it attacks with a natural weapon and rolls a natural 1, it provokes an attack of opportunity from its target, even if that creature would not otherwise be entitled to make one.</SpecialAbilities>

Fortune-Spurned Curse (Su) Once per month, Baillaset can curse up to 25 humanoids, permanently giving them his fortune-spurned template. Baillaset has already used this ability this month cursing the Zyphus cultists. Resurrection Vulnerability (Su) A raise dead or similar spell cast on a wight destroys it (Will negates). Using the spell in this way does not require a material component. Twist of Fate (Su) The first time in any given day that a fortune-spurned creature rolls a natural 20 on a saving throw, it fails the save. This twist of fate happens only once per day.

Each time Aelzeldra hits a foe with her claw attack, the victim takes 2 points of Strength damage unless he resists the weakness with a DC 17 Fortitude save. Alternatively, Aelzeldra can attempt to inflict even greater weakness by making a touch attack&amp;#8211;this variant requires a standard action, and cannot be attempted in the same round she makes claw attacks.

    <SpecialAbilities>Corrupting Gaze (Su) Gresaril is disfigured through violence, and has a gaze attack with a range of 30 feet that causes 2d10 damage and 1d4 Charisma damage (Fortitude save negates Charisma damage but not physical damage). Corrupting Touch (Su) All ghosts gain this incorporeal touch attack. By passing part of her incorporeal body through a foe's body as a standard action, Gresaril inflicts 7d6 damage. This damage is not negative energy&amp;#8211;it manifests in the form of physical wounds and aches from supernatural aging. Creatures immune to magical aging are immune to this damage, but otherwise the damage bypasses all forms of damage reduction. A Fortitude save halves the damage taken. Mimicry (Ex) Gresaril can imitate the sounds of almost any animal found near her lair. Rejuvenation (Su) If destroyed, Gresaril restores herself in 2d4 days. The only way to permanently destroy Gresaril is to put the dying curse to rest by slaying Tylaca and Aelzeldra.</SpecialAbilities>

    <BeforeCombat>Prior to infiltrating the Pathfinder Lodge, each cultist uses a scroll of magic vestment to protect himself and a scroll of status to remain aware of one another's condition. They also use death knell against the servants and guards they slay. Once alerted by the activation of the glyph of warding at the gate (or after observing anyone bypassing it), they cast deathwatch, eagle's splendor, and shield of faith on themselves and place blast runes in the squares around them, preparing for an attack.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>With the power of deathwatch to aid them, the cultists fire poisoned bolts at any PC that avoided damage from the sound burst. Then, they continue sniping at intruders to draw them to the blast runes in front of them. Thereafter, they draw their scimitars and channel negative energy to wear down opponents, trusting in their status effect to warn their colleagues inside the lodge.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>The cultists retreat to area 3 after falling below 20 hit points so they can cast meld into stone and buy time to heal themselves before renewing the attack.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Ka Stone (Su) During his induction, a living monolith receives an engraved scarab stone in his forehead. This stone is inscribed on its inner side with the monolith's true name and oaths to the gods and pharaohs. It cannot be removed without his permission, cannot be dispelled (though it ceases functioning in areas where magic does not work), and does not use a magic item slot. The ka stone tightly binds the monolith's mind and spirit to his body, providing him with a +2 bonus on saves against negative levels, negative energy, death effects, and mind-affecting effects. A living monolith can also invoke the power of his ka stone three times per day as a swift action, enabling him to grow in size as if using enlarge person (even if he is not a humanoid).</SpecialAbilities>

    <BeforeCombat>Soth uses any interaction with the PCs before beginning combat to determine which Pathfinder seems to be most suspicious or in charge. He prefers to study humans, as he knows himself to be most effective in killing them, but prepares his death attack against whoever seems to be the greatest threat against his ruse.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>If Soth has prepared his death attack and can execute it against a flat-footed foe, he does so, risking retaliation before he can cast greater teleport the following round.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>If unable to execute his death attack in the first round, Soth uses his ring of the binding word's daily greater teleport ability to flee to his master's chamber in area C6 in the first round of combat.</Morale>

    <BeforeCombat>If the lookouts spot the approaching Pathfinders and report their arrival to the larger cult, six of them gather their weapons and move to the mouth of the cave, while another six climb vines and ready swinging attacks. If unaware of the PCs, the cultists are dispersed throughout the room, either sleeping or eating.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>The cultists begin shrieking when they make their first attack and continue until killed. The cultists on the vines swing across the cavern on each turn, using their Combat Expertise, Mobility, and Spring Attack feats to attack PCs as they pass.</DuringCombat>

    <SpecialAbilities>Fear Aura (Su) Creatures with fewer than 5 HD in a 60-foot radius of the lich that look at him must succeed on a Will save or become frightened. Creatures with 5 HD or more must succeed at a Will save or be shaken for a number of rounds equal to the lich's Hit Dice. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same lich's aura for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. Paralyzing Touch (Su) Any living creature a lich hits with its touch attack must succeed on a Fortitude save or be permanently paralyzed. Remove paralysis or any spell that can remove a curse can free the victim (see the bestow curse spell description, with a DC equal to the lich's save DC). The effect cannot be dispelled. Anyone paralyzed by a lich seems dead, though a DC 20 Perception check or a DC 15 Heal check reveals that the victim is still alive.</SpecialAbilities>

    <BeforeCombat>If alerted to the PCs' attack on his cultists in area Z1 or the creatures in Z2, Chorkak casts blade barrier on the entrance to his chamber to provide himself additional time to buff. He augments himself and Garugu with as many of the following as possible, in the following order: antilife shell, righteous might, shield of faith, divine power, and true seeing. He then summons a fiendish dire ape with summon monster IV and three additional apes with summon nature's ally IV on the far side of the wall of blades, using speak with animals to direct them to drop from the ceiling onto foes below, and readies to cast harm on the first PC to bypass the blade barrier.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Chorkak prefers to use magic against his enemies, casting such spells as bestow curse, chaos hammer, harm, slay living, and unholy blight, but does not hesitate to engage in melee should PCs penetrate or dispel his antilife sphere. He uses his +1 unholy spear if granted a full attack or his paralyzing touch if restricted to a single attack action. He heals himself with negative energy as needed.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Chorkak knows his phylactery is safe and does not fear destruction. He fights to the death.</Morale>

At this point she uses her scroll of mage armor and hides behind the northwest shelf.

    <BeforeCombat>When the PCs attack or talk to the mercenaries in area A5, Celeena is alerted to their presence. At this point she uses her scroll of mage armor and her scroll of shield, casts eagle's splendor on herself, and hides behind the northwest shelf. Once she thinks the PCs have either allied with her mercenaries or killed them, she casts summon monster IV and summons a hell hound, directing it to stand in the square just north of the door and attack the first PC who enters.</BeforeCombat>
    <DuringCombat>Celeena casts black tentacles and glitterdust first, hitting the PCs fighting the hell hound. She then uses her wand of magic missile, casts scorching ray and acid arrow for ranged attacks, and casts suggestion, color spray, and burning hands once the PCs get closer. If the hell hound falls and she has time, she summons another to block the PCs from reaching her.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>Celeena is obsessed but not stupid&amp;#8211;if reduce to five hit points or fewer, she surrenders.</Morale>
