    <SpecialAbilities>Dual Mind (Ex) The fact that each ceratioidi is actually two creatures sharing the same body gives it a number of unique abilities. A ceratioidi can delegate various actions and physical processes to the individual minds, allowing it to fight with two weapons simultaneously without any penalties. It can also select two favored classes. The telepathic tangle between its twin consciousnesses makes a ceratioidi impervious to mind-affecting effects. Lure (Su) As a free action, a ceratioidi can light the dangling lure on its forehead, forcing all non-ceratioidi within a 20-foot radius to make a DC 15 Will save or become fascinated for 1 round. Regardless of the preceding interaction between the ceratioidi and its target, a creature affected by this ability does not view the ceratioidi who has fascinated it as a potential threat until that ceratioidi actually attacks-allowing it to approach without breaking the fascination. Once a creature successfully saves against this effect, it is immune to the same ceratioidi's lure ability for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based. Primitive Amphibian (Ex) Ceratioidi have rudimentary lungs capable of breathing air indefinitely, but their skin must be bathed in salt water regularly or it begins drying out painfully. They can go for a number of hours equal to twice their Constitution score (30 hours for most ceratioidi) before they need to be bathed in salt water-if they don't, they take 1 point of Constitution damage per hour. Any Constitution damage accrued is reversed after they spend at least 10 minutes immersed in salt water.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Rulers of deep ocean trenches, ceratioidi share several unusual traits with the aquatic predators of the ceratiidae family, also known as angler fish. From their strange, spired cities beneath the waves, ceratioidi cast their nets of inf luence far and wide. Perhaps the strangest aspect of the ceratioidi is that each individual is in fact two entities-a powerful, imposing female, and a rat-sized parasitic male who spends most of his life attached to his mate's neck. A female without a mate loses her dual mind ability, while a male unattached to a female retains his intelligence but otherwise has the same statistics as an electric eel (without the electricity special ability or electricity resistance).</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Cerberus's Jaws (Su) Curse-bite; save Fort DC 18; effect dimensional anchoring. A creature affected by this curse cannot utilize extradimensional travel such as teleport, as if it were under the effect of a dimensional anchor spell. The save DC is Constitution-based. Soul Scent (Su) This ability functions as the scent ability, save that it also grants the cerberi a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks made to track undead. This ability even allows a cerberi to track the passage of an incorporeal creature.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The mythical watchdogs of Hell, cerberi bear the bodies of terrible, powerful hounds combined with the essences of fiends. Relied upon by villains and frightful beings as guardians and jailers, these three-headed canine abominations possess far greater cunning than their flensed, bestial appearances would suggest-a terrible intellect they pour largely into malice and enjoyment of their victims' tormented ends. Cerberi draw upon a legendary pedigree, all reputedly tracing their lineage to a single primordial evil beast said to still guard the foundations of some forsaken, deathly realm. Brethren to hell hounds, cerberi loathe their distant kin, viciously attacking such hellspawn if not kept at heel by a tyrannical master. In their natural infernal environments, cerberi might be found anywhere powerful fiends have need for guardians. Cerberi's incredible ability to trap victims on planes and track the dead make them highly coveted servants across the multiverse. The hounds' bestial appearances and love of slaughter often cause those who consider themselves cerberi owners to forget the deviousness of their allies, a development that often ends poorly, if not bloodily, for the unwary and the weak. Outside of the devil-tamed reaches of Hell and other foul extraplanar wildernesses, small groups of cerberi gather in harsh, packlike communities. Typically dominated by the strongest or wiliest member, such packs form swift and deadly throngs, stalking trespassers upon their vast hunting grounds and doggedly pursuing any scent of lost souls. Although cerberi gain no sustenance from attacking the dead, all gain a vicious satisfaction at the feeling of an immortal essence discorporating forever within their deadly jaws, as befits their infernal nature. A typical cerberi stands a broad 4 feet tall and weighs over 200 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Otherworldly Mind (Ex) Any creature attempting to contact a cerebric fungus's mind or read its thoughts with a divination spell or similar ability must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be overwhelmed by the alien thoughts in the creature's head. Those who fail take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage and are confused for 1d6 rounds, and the divination effect immediately ends. The save is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus. Star-Shriek (Ex) Once per day as a full-round action, a cerebric fungus can unleash a shrill scream of madness. All creatures (except other cerebric fungi) within 30 feet must make a DC 15 Will save or be nauseated for 1d4 rounds. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Constitution-based. Touch of Madness (Sp) The cerebric fungus may daze one living creature by making a successful touch attack. The target creature must succeed at a DC 14 Will save, or it becomes dazed for 1 round per caster level (4 rounds for most cerebric fungi). The dazed subject is not stunned (so attackers get no special advantage against it). This is a mind-affecting enchantment, equivalent to a 2nd-level spell. Unsettling Appearance (Su) A cerebric fungus constantly scans the minds of those around it, projecting around itself a confusing collage of images gleaned from their thoughts. Creatures within 60 feet that can see the fungus must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or take a -2 penalty on attack rolls. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Cerebric fungi are a race of carnivorous, intelligent fungi native to a distant planet. Although they are one of the lowliest life forms on their homeworld, the fungi still possess an alien intellect far beyond that of most terrestrial creatures. Cerebric fungi display great curiosity about other races and species when they visit other worlds, asking endless, apparently senseless, questions and engaging in disturbing experiments. Some eccentric scholars claim to have learned unsettling secrets from these interrogations. Although capable of fine manipulation with their prehensile filaments, cerebric fungi normally forgo the use of weapons in favor of their natural attacks.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Cannon (Ex) One of a goliath's arms ends in a cannon. The goliath may use this as one of its four slam attacks, or it can use it to fire cannonballs. A cannon has a range increment of 100 feet, and deals 6d6 points of bludgeoning and piercing damage on a hit with a x4 critical modifier. A clockwork goliath's cannon can hold up to 12 cannonballs-reloading a single cannonball is a standard action. Self-Destruction (Su) When a goliath's hit points are reduced to 10% its total (21 hp for most clockwork goliaths) or less but still above 0, it self-destructs on its next turn, bursting in an explosion of metal scraps and steam that deals 12d6 points of slashing damage plus 12d6 points of fire damage to all creatures within a 20-foot-radius burst. A successful DC 24 Reflex save halves the damage. The save is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The thunderous clockwork goliath is easily recognized as the epitome of technology created to destroy. The exact nature of a clockwork goliath's "hands" varies-they all resolve as slam attacks in melee combat, though. The clockwork goliath towers over most creatures and buildings; standing at a height of 45 feet, it weighs over 100 tons. CONSTRUCTION The clockwork goliath is one of the most difficult of its kind to create. The creator must start with crafted clockwork pieces worth 20,000 gp.

    <SpecialAbilities>Breath Weapon (Su) A clockwork leviathan's breath weapon is a powerful jet of scorching steam-it functions equally well above and under water. Grind (Ex) A clockwork leviathan deals an additional 1d8+16 points of slashing damage when it makes a successful grapple check because of the myriad twisting gears and churning pistons that make up its jagged underbelly. Swallow Whole (Ex) A clockwork leviathan's interior is filled with injurious grinding gears and superheated water-in addition to taking damage, a swallowed creature must hold its breath or risk drowning as long as it remains inside a clockwork leviathan's "stomach."</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Clockwork leviathans are equally capable of functioning on land and in water. Sailors who are haunted by the memories of these treacherous machines need not exaggerate their yarns, for the reality of an aquatic construct such as this holds enough terror in its story for even the hardiest of seafarers. A clockwork leviathan's numerous metal plates and links are made of such resilient material that they never rust, even after long exposure to the briny sea waters that leviathans often patrol. Clockwork leviathans are 25 feet long and weigh just over 3 tons. CONSTRUCTION When creating these clockworks, great care must be taken to waterproof their components.

    <SpecialAbilities>Net (Ex) As a standard action, a clockwork servant can launch a net from its shoulder. The launcher itself can contain up to five nets-loading a folded net into the launcher is a standard action. Some clockwork servants are outfitted with masterwork or even magic nets, although the clockwork servant presented here is armed with standard nets. Repair Clockwork (Ex) Clockwork servants are adept at repairing other clockwork constructs. As a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity, a clockwork servant can repair damage done to either itself or an adjacent clockwork creature, healing 1d10 points of damage to the target.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Since clockwork engineers can't always be present to make sure their devices are working at full capacity, the clockwork servant was invented to serve that role. Clockwork servants excel at repairing themselves and other clockworks on the battlefield, proving useful for skirmishes and campaigns alike. Rumors of clockwork servants with magically imparted intelligence persist among explorers of certain strange ruins-while no smarter than the average human, such "awakened" clockwork servants have skills and feats as appropriate for their Hit Dice (Disable Device +7, Perception +2, and Skill Focus [Disable Device] for most intelligent clockwork servants), and are said to serve in more complex roles than mere repair workers. An intelligent clockwork has an Intelligence score of 11 and can speak one language. Clockwork servants are about 5 feet tall and weigh over 400 pounds. CONSTRUCTION The creator of a clockwork servant must start with crafted clockwork pieces worth 500 gp. CLOCKWORK SERVANT CL 12th; Price 7,500 gp (13,500 for an intelligent servant) CONSTRUCTION Requirements Craft Construct, geas/quest and make whole, creator must be at least caster level 12th; Skill Craft (clockwork) DC 20; Cost 4,000 gp (7,000 for an intelligent clockwork servant)</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Efficient Winding (Ex) A clockwork soldier can function for 2 days per Hit Die every time it is wound. Latch (Ex) Clockwork soldiers have specially designed hands that easily grasp and lock onto weapons and objects. A soldier can attempt to disarm or grapple as a standard action without provoking an attack of opportunity, and it receives a +2 bonus on disarm checks. In addition, it receives a +2 bonus to CMD against attempts to disarm it. Proficient (Ex) A clockwork soldier is proficient with all simple and martial weapons. Standby (Ex) A clockwork soldier can place itself on standby as a standard action. While on standby, a clockwork soldier cannot move or take any actions. It remains aware of its surroundings but takes a -4 penalty on Perception checks. Time spent on standby does not count against the soldier's wind-down duration. A clockwork soldier can exit standby as a swift action-if it does so to initiate combat, it gains a +4 racial bonus on its Initiative check.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The clockwork soldier is a mechanical mercenary that fights to the death for its creator. With the ability to wield most weapons with full proficiency, clockwork soldiers are versatile and wholly unpredictable foes. Most are armed with magic weapons-a +1 halberd being the most common armament. Clockwork soldiers are among the most efficient constructs of their kind. They are ideal for sentry and guard duty. Clockwork soldiers have the same basic shape as a human. They are 6 feet tall and weigh 500 pounds. CONSTRUCTION The creator must start with crafted clockwork pieces worth 1,000 gp; the cost of the soldier's weapon is not included in this price. CLOCKWORK SOLDIER CL 12th; Price 37,000 gp CONSTRUCTION Requirements Craft Construct, geas/quest and heroism, creator must be at least caster level 12th; Skill Craft (clockwork) DC 20; Cost 19,000 gp</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Record Audio (Su) A clockwork spy can record nearby sounds as a swift action, archiving all sound within a 20-foot spread onto a small gemstone worth 50 gp embedded in its body. The clockwork spy can record up to 1 hour of sound per Hit Die it possesses. Starting and stopping playback of recorded sound is a swift action. Removing a gemstone or installing a gemstone into a clockwork spy requires a DC 25 Disable Device check as a full-round action-failure does not damage the gemstone but does erase any recorded sounds on the gemstone. Since clockwork spies are not intelligent, they must be given simple commands as to when they are to start recording sounds. A clockwork spy can differentiate between creature types and subtypes, but not between specific individuals-a spy can be ordered to start recording sound as soon as a humanoid (human) or an aberration comes in range, but it cannot be ordered to start recording when a specific person comes within range. Once a clockwork spy begins recording sound, it cannot cease recording early. Likewise, it cannot record sound onto a gemstone that already contains a recording. Self-Destruct (Su) Unless specifically programmed otherwise by its creator, a clockwork spy explodes 1 round after it is destroyed. During this round, the thing shrieks and thrashes about as if undergoing convulsions. On what would normally have been the clockwork spy's next action, it explodes, dealing 1d6 points of fire damage in a 5-foot radius (Reflex DC 10 for half damage). A DC 20 Disable Device check made as a standard action can halt the spy's self-destruct sequence, but does not prevent it from dying. A clockwork spy that self-destructs automatically destroys its gemstone, along with any information contained inside it. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>These spindly and discreet mechanical arachnids are ideal for surveillance and reconnaissance missions, and can be vital tools in political intrigues or illicit consortium tactics. Their retractable, insectile wings make the swift creatures even craftier foes than most would anticipate. As they are less combat-oriented than many other clockworks, if a clockwork spy is caught in the act of recording its target, escape is usually the most practical course of action for it. Clockwork spies are about 2 feet wide from leg to leg, and weigh less than 40 pounds. CONSTRUCTION These delicate constructs are full of small parts and difficult to construct. The creator must start with crafted clockwork pieces worth 250 gp. CLOCKWORK SPY CL 12th; Price 1,250 gp CONSTRUCTION Requirements Craft Construct, geas/quest and ghost sound, creator must be at least caster level 12th; Skill Craft (clockwork) DC 20; Cost 750 gp</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Icewalking (Ex) A cold rider and any creature it rides can move across icy surfaces without penalty and do not need to make Acrobatics checks to run or charge on ice. They may climb icy surfaces as if under the effects of the spider climb spell. Implements of Ice (Su) A cold rider wears full plate armor and wields a +2 icy burst glaive made of magical ice as hard as steel. Its armor has no armor check penalty. When a cold rider dies, its armor and glaive melt into water in 1d6 rounds. Susceptible to Shatter (Ex) A shatter spell deals 3d6 points of damage to a cold rider (no save) and reduces its armor bonus by 2 for 1 minute. Shatter spells automatically overcome a cold rider's spell resistance.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Cold riders are terrifying armored majesties, clad in cloaks of frost with a pair of large crystal-blue antlers cresting their almost skeletal heads. Their icy armor and weapons are as much a part of them as their frozen flesh. Cold riders delight in perversion, slaughter, and the corruption of other fey. They prefer undead or cold-resistant steeds, but even when they have no access to such, their phantom steed spell-like ability ensures they never go long without a mount. Cold riders are 7 feet tall, though their antlers easily add another 2 feet to their height. They weigh 300 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Darting Claw (Ex) Evolved for snatching fast prey, a shark-eating crab is exceptionally quick with its claws. When making a full attack, if a shark-eating crab misses with both of its claw attacks, it can make an additional claw attack at a -2 penalty against any creature within its reach.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Extremely fast and agile for such a large creature, the shark-eating crab preys on predators of the sea. Not limiting its consumption to just sharks, these crabs feed on fast-moving fish like barracudas and tuna, and even mollusks like giant squid. Their hunting skills have evolved over the ages to track the movements of fast creatures swimming above them as the crabs blend into their surroundings. The typical shark-eating crab stands 16 feet tall and weighs just over 4,000 pounds.</Description>

    <Description>A bane to all vessels traveling the seas, shipwrecker crabs can ruin the career of a merchant captain in minutes, destroying her ship, dumping its cargo into the waters below, and plucking her drowning crew from the wreckage for food. Shipwrecker crabs live most of their lives in shallow seas, coming near the coast or surface to hunt and feed. A shipwrecker crab measures 50 feet across, with two long arms capable of extending a further 30 feet each, and weighs 6 tons.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Flash of Brutality (Su) Once per day as a swift action, a great cyclops can gain a burst of savage of inspiration. When it does, it doubles the threat range of all weapons, natural attacks, and rock attacks it makes until the start of its next turn. Furthermore, once per day, when the great cyclops reaches 0 or fewer hit points and is conscious because of its Diehard feat, this ability recharges, allowing it to use the ability a second time that same day.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Degenerate giants of cyclops-kind, the legendary great cyclopes embody the rage and dark doom of this race of uncanny seers. In their eyes blaze endless possibilities for bloodshed and terror, their myopic gazes seeming to witness the potential for infinite deaths and devastations hidden within each moment. Gigantic but dull-witted, these massive savages are usually loners, but occasionally either need or fate drives them to rampages from which few are safe. Such undeniable force brings with it a dread that, in many instances, grows to reverence, giving rise to strange cults that cloak these cyclopes with veils of menace and dark legends. Denizens of remote and primeval parts of the world, great cyclopes typically dwell in lands where none might intrude upon them-deserted islands, high craggy mountains, and stoic hill countries often provide the great caves they favor as lairs. While most avoid well-traveled or populated lands, spending much of their time hunting megafauna and even monstrous prey in the wilds, some, driven by hunger or a desperation to wander, seek out the paths and settlements of humanoids, finding that their fragile buildings are easily shattered and that the mewling creatures make savory meals. The average great cyclops stands approximately 30 feet tall and weighs upward of 4 tons, though individuals of significantly greater size are known.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Chained Daggers (Su) A crucidaemon fights with the two daggers chained to its wrists as if dual wielding daggers with a reach of 10 feet (although it can also attack adjacent foes with no penalty). It takes no penalty on attack or damage rolls while wielding both of these daggers at once. These daggers are considered to be +2 daggers that deal 2d6 points of bleed damage. The daggers become nonmagical upon the daemon's death, and cannot be disarmed. A crucidaemon may remanifest a destroyed dagger as a standard action. Trap Making (Ex) A crucidaemon can use Disable Device to disarm magic traps. When it uses its greater glyph of warding spell-like ability to create a spell glyph, it may utilize any 6th-level or lower spell from the cleric or the wizard spell list, even though it otherwise can't cast these spells. The Perception and Disable Device DCs for any traps a crucidaemon creates gain a +2 bonus.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Bloody representations of death by traps or torture, crucidaemons spend their existence subjecting creatures to an eternity of pain and terror. Whereas many daemons are quick to feed on the soul of mortals they capture, a crucidaemon lets its victims linger, marinating their souls in torment and pain so that when the time for feeding finally comes, they welcome their final oblivion with tears of gratitude. Crucidaemons are 6 feet tall and weigh 250 pounds.</Description>

    <Description>These deceptive daemons personify death resulting from murder accented with betrayal. Most often formed from the souls of evil creatures killed by family or friends, vulnudaemons spread their insanity throughout the worlds by deceiving and killing all creatures they meet. Vulnudaemons stalk their prey, infecting them with a sense of impending doom and watching their reactions, learning their responses before attacking and savoring their death. These daemons serve as excellent assassins, hiding in the shadows before debilitating their enemies, or striking from the protection of invisibility in order to deliver the killing blow. When facing stronger enemies, vulnudaemons seek to wear them down through a series of attacks, nicking at them and darting off, then repeating the process until their opponents bleed out. Vulnudaemons often find themselves called to the Material Plane by cultists of deities associated with murder and assassination. These cultists often see vulnudaemons as sacred creatures favored by their deity, and rather than simply use the daemons as assassins, cultists often grant them a shocking degree of freedom to wander the region as they will, picking victims to fit their own agendas and murdering whomever they wish. Cultists who conjure vulnudaemons into the world usually take care to show the daemons a secret hand sign or other code that members of the cult can show them, lest the monsters decide to target one of the believers for an attack. Whether or not an accidentally targeted cultist has the time to flash her safety sign to the daemon should the creature attack her at a later date is, of course, another matter. Vulnudaemons stand 3 feet tall and weigh 25 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Acid (Ex) A deathtrap ooze secretes acid that dissolves only flesh. Creatures made of materials other than flesh are immune to this acid. Trap Form (Su) Taking 1 minute to do so, a deathtrap ooze can assume the form of any Medium or Large mechanical trap that has no more than one moving part (excluding pits). The ooze can maintain this form indefinitely. The trap it can assume the form of must be of a CR equal to or less than that of the deathtrap ooze itself-appropriate traps from pages 420-421 of the Core Rulebook include the swinging axe trap (CR 1), the wall scythe trap (CR 4), and the falling block trap (CR 5). In trap form, the ooze uses its attack bonus, but otherwise functions as the emulated trap and uses that trap's statistics and damage. If a creature searching for traps exceeds the DC to find the ooze's trap form, a successful follow-up DC 19 Knowledge (dungeoneering) check allows the creature that discovered the trap to discern its true nature. If the ooze takes any damage, it reverts to its normal form as a free action. Otherwise, reverting to its normal form takes a swift action.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>A deathtrap ooze is a disgusting mass of brown-orange sludge that moves and hunts of its own volition. It exists only to feed. Thought to be related to ochre jellies, the deathtrap ooze is up to 12 feet wide and 6 inches deep in its normal, mobile form. While moving, it shrinks a foot or two in width, gaining about 6 inches of height, and rolls forward in a quivering mass. Deathtrap oozes are less inclined to look for prey than are other oozes-they prefer to hunt by ambush. Their ability to assume the form of simple mechanical traps has long intrigued scholars, but this ability is not something born out of intellect as much as by supernatural cunning. A deathtrap ooze lacks any creative ability-it can only mimic traps that it has encountered during its wanderings, and even then, the repertoire of trap designs it can draw upon is limited to just the last few it has encountered. These oozes surely have an origin rooted in magical meddling. Countless ancient crypts have such oozes within, lurking patiently in ageless trap form, awaiting would-be tomb-raiders for a first-in-centuries breakfast. Those who have studied the deathtrap ooze suppose that wizards of some lost culture altered ochre jellies into perfect guardians. Like ochre jellies, elder deathtrap oozes can grow to be enormous. Rumor holds that some can also duplicate even more complex traps that release toxic fumes, spray acid, or contain poison. Some even claim there are oozes so huge that they can duplicate traps that fill entire rooms with multiple moving parts.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Poison (Ex) Infestation-injury; save Fort DC 17; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Str damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Charisma-based. Infestation (Su) An infestation of poisonous spiders, which nest within this creature's exoskeleton, constantly surrounds a deathweb, to a radius of 5 feet. Any creature within the infestation takes 1d6 points of damage at the end of each round it remains in the area. A creature that takes this damage must make a DC 17 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. In addition, those damaged by this infestation are poisoned as well. Any area effect attack that deals 10 or more points of damage to a deathweb destroys its infesting spiders, removing its aura for 3 rounds, after which a new batch of spiders swarms out of the undead's body to replenish the infestation. The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>A deathweb is the undead exoskeleton of a massive spider animated with the vilest necromancy. The spells that create this monstrosity bind to it thousands of normal spiders, which together form the mind of the undead beast like an arachnid hive. These smaller spiders live in and direct their exoskeleton home, working together to swarm around the deathweb and weave its web sheets. The exoskeleton of a deathweb is cracked and full of holes to allow the resident spiders easy passage into and out of it. Although the exoskeleton can be up to 10 feet long, the largest spiders within are only 6 inches in length. The variety in the sizes of the internal spiders allows them to ably move all parts of the exoskeleton, giving the massive carapace amazing dexterity and swiftness, as well as cleverness, perception, and presence. These capabilities make deathwebs resourceful and frightening opponents, especially when adversaries mistake them for normal monstrous arachnids or mindless undead. Because of their ability to squeeze into tight surroundings, deathwebs may be found lurking in all manner of niches. Deathwebs lair where they can build webs to trap passersby, such as among thick trees or in caves or tunnels. The creatures don't actively collect valuables, but they kill indiscriminately to feed the multitude of spiders within. Webs in a deathweb's lair are thus likely to contain valuables despite the creature's lack of interest in wealth.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Devour Soul (Su) As a standard action with a range of 300 feet, a demilich can imprison the soul of a living creature within one of 10 special gems embedded in its skull. If the target succeeds at a DC 24 Fortitude save, it gains two permanent negative levels. If it fails, its soul is immediately drawn into one of the gems in the demilich's skull. The soul remains trapped within the gem, visible as but a gleam except under true seeing. The soulless body corrupts and decays rapidly, reducing to dust in a single round. As long as the dead creature's soul remains trapped in the gemstone, it cannot be restored to life via any means save direct divine intervention. Gems with souls trapped in them can be retrieved from a destroyed demilich, at which point they can either be crushed to release any souls within to their afterlife or used in the place of the usual material components to restore the soul and body with resurrection or true resurrection. After 24 hours, the demilich can choose to consume any soul trapped in a gem, healing it 1d6 hit points per Hit Die of the soul, at which point only miracle or wish can restore the dead creature to life. The save DC is Charisma-based, and includes a +2 bonus for the Ability Focus feat. Greater Bestow Curse (Sp) This spell-like ability functions like bestow curse, but can have one of the following effects: -12 to one ability score; -6 to two ability scores; -8 penalty on attack rolls, saves, and checks; or a 25% chance to act normally. This ability is treated as a 6th-level spell. Immunity to Magic (Su) A demilich is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells function differently against the creature, as noted below. • A dispel evil spell deals 2d6 points of damage, with no saving throw. • Holy smite affects a demilich normally. • A power word kill spoken by an ethereal caster deals 50 points of damage to the demilich if it fails a Fortitude save (with a DC determined as though the spell allowed a saving throw). • A shatter spell deals 1d6 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 10d6), with no saving throw. Rejuvenation (Su) A destroyed demilich reforms in 2d6 days. To permanently destroy a demilich, holy water must be poured over its remains within the area of a hallow spell. To complete the destruction, holy word or dispel evil must be cast. If the caster succeeds at a caster level check with a DC equal to 10 + the demilich's Hit Dice, the demilich is permanently destroyed. Telekinetic Storm (Su) As a special use of its telekinesis spell-like ability, a demilich can churn up its treasure, dust, bones, and other loose debris in the area into a whirling storm about its skull. The storm obscures vision as a fog cloud within a 20-foot spread centered on the demilich's skull. Creatures within the storm take 12d6 points of damage per round on the demilich's turn (Reflex DC 20 for half damage). The demilich can maintain the storm indefinitely by concentrating. Torpor (Ex) A demilich takes no actions against intruders unless its remains or treasure are disturbed. Unholy Grace (Su) A demilich gains a bonus on saves and a profane bonus to AC equal to its Charisma modifier. Vorpal Susceptibility (Ex) Vorpal weapons of any kind ignore a demilich's damage reduction.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>In their endless years of unlife, some liches lose themselves in introspection, and can no longer rouse themselves to face the endless march of days. Still others cast their consciousness far from their bodies, wandering planes and realities far beyond mortal ken. Absent the vitality of the soul, such a lich's physical form succumbs to decay over the centuries. In time, only the lich's skull remains intact. Yet the bonds of undeath keep the lich's remains from final dissolution. Vestiges of the lich's intellect remain within the skull, and wake to terrible wrath should it be disturbed. Traces of the lich's will to live strengthen the skull, rendering it harder than any steel. The lich's greed and lust for power manifest in the growth of gems in its skull. Lastly, though only the barest remnants of the lich's eldritch might survive, a demilich aroused to anger still retains enough power to flense the very soul from any defiling its final rest. The lich's phylactery invariably fails during the slow decline of lich into demilich, losing its last vestiges of enchantment if not crumbling into dust with the lich's body. But even without the preserving power of the phylactery, demiliches retain a tenacious grip on existence. Only powerful and precise use of magic can permanently destroy a demilich and its remains. To the unwary adventurer, a demilich looks like nothing more than dust and bones within the lich's former sanctum. Indeed, until disturbed, a demilich has only the vaguest awareness of intruders, and ignores their presence. Any attempt to steal the demilich's possessions, disturb its remains, or harm its domain rouses the demilich's slumbering mind, causing it to rise up in the air and voice its wail of the banshee before again settling to the ground. Should the interlopers relent, the skull returns to its torpor. But if they persist, the skull rises again, not to rest again until all in its sight have perished. Fortunately for intruders, demiliches never pursue those wise enough flee. BECOMING A DEMILICH Most demiliches achieved their state through apathy, not volition. For each decade that a demilich fails to stir itself to meaningful action, there is a 1% cumulative chance that its corporeal body decays into dust, save for the skull. Any return to activity resets the chance of transformation to 0%. Once the lich's body decays, the lich's intellect returns to its phylactery as normal. However, the skull rejects the return of the lich's consciousness, keeping the lich trapped in its deteriorating phylactery for 1d10 years. If during that time the lich's remains are destroyed or scattered (for example, by wandering adventurers), the lich's phylactery forms a new body and the intellect leaves the phylactery as normal, returning the lich to life. But if the lich's remains survive unperturbed, the phylactery's magic fails catastrophically, releasing the lich's soul and causing 5d10 points of damage to the phylactery. Regardless of whether or not the phylactery physically survives, the energies released by its failure channel into the lifeless skull of the lich, allowing the last remnants of the lich's soul to transform it into a demilich. The lich's soul itself either is utterly destroyed, reaches its final reward or punishment, or is condemned to wander the edges of the multiverse forever. For wandering liches, the process is similar, but based on the number of decades the lich spends without its intellect returning to its body. While the lich's body still decays, its mind remains at large, only becoming trapped in the phylactery if the lich tries to return during the period in which its body has failed, but it has not yet become a demilich. Should the lich's phylactery fail before the wandering lich returns, the skull becomes a demilich, and the lich's mind is doomed to wander until the end of days. AWAKENED DEMILICHES Under exceptional conditions, a lich's full consciousness survives its transformation into a demilich, or a lich's wandering intellect manages to return to its jeweled skull. Such creatures are awakened demiliches, and combine the powers and near-invulnerability of a demilich with the mind and spellcasting prowess of a lich. An awakened demilich has the full spellcasting abilities of the lich it was before, and gains Eschew Materials and Still Spell as bonus feats. Awakened liches keep their original lich Hit Dice, and any mental attributes that are higher than the demilich's minimums. They otherwise have all the special abilities and defenses of a demilich, and no abilities of the original lich beyond spellcasting and mental attributes. An awakened demilich has a CR of 16, or the CR of the original lich + 3, whichever is higher.</Description>

    <Description>Shaggy demodands are obese outsiders that occupy the highest status within demodand society. The fleshy tyrants stand just under 7 feet tall and have huge bat wings capable of supporting their 600-pound weight. Their faces have the broad-set eyes of a toad and toothy underbites. Although they still answer to their titanic masters, shaggy demodands are the masters of their kind, and serve the thanatotic titans as advisors, covert agents, or battlefield generals. In the Abyss, shaggy demodands command great armies, leading them against demonic hordes as the balance of Abyssal power ebbs and flows. Often underestimated due to their shape, these demodands are both intelligent and cunning, and approach battle with an effective mixture of strategy and ruthless detachment.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Acid (Su) A slimy demodand is coated in an ever-dripping layer of acid that deals an extra 2d6 points of acid damage on a successful natural attack. In addition, opponents that successfully strike a slimy demodand with an unarmed strike or natural attack take 2d6 points of acid damage. Dread Claws (Ex) A slimy demodand adds 1-1/2 times its strength bonus on all attack rolls made when using its claws.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Slimy demodands are more muscular than shaggy demodands, but aren't as lithe or quick as their tarry brethren. They have froglike heads, similar to those of the shaggy demodands, but their constantly darting eyes give them a more feral look. A slimy demodand stands 6 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds. Slimy demodands often serve as shock troops in demodand armies, but they are also frequently put in charge of gathering and keeping slaves. Slimy demodands have no magical mind control powers, but prefer to rely upon intimidation and physical threats anyway to manage their slaves and keep them in line.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Adhesion (Ex) A creature striking a tarry demodand with a manufactured weapon must make a DC 23 Reflex save; failure means the weapon sticks to the demodand and cannot be used to make attacks until freed. Freeing a stuck weapon requires a successful grapple check. This adhesion grants a +4 racial bonus to CMD against disarm attempts.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Tarry demodands are lithe and lean compared to other demodands. Despite this difference, all tarry demodands are strong and agile. Although their batlike wings appear tattered and useless, they can still fly. A tarry demodand stands 7 feet tall and weighs 400 pounds. The tarry demodand is the grunt of the demodand army-bred for battle, these swift and deadly demodands make up the bulk of any demodand legion. That they themselves are more powerful than most outsiders is as much a testament to their race as anything else-a single tarry demodand is a formidable opponent, to say nothing of a group of the creatures. Although tarry demodands are quite strong, they prefer using light weapons-one in each hand. Tarry demodands only rarely use larger weaponry, and then only when directly ordered by a superior. They lack the terrific claws of the greater demodands, and a tarry demodand with no weapons tends to flee combat as soon as possible, only to return when it is properly armed.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Droning Wings (Ex) Once per day, when it flutters its wings as a standard action, a coloxus can create a mesmerizing display of color and a sound-dampening buzzing drone. All creatures within 30 feet that can see the coloxus must make a DC 24 Will save or be slowed for up to 6 rounds. Each subsequent round, the coloxus must take a swift action to maintain the effect or the effect ceases at the end of its turn. Additionally, the sound creates a buffer against sonic energy, granting the fly demon immunity to sonic attacks or effects while it continues to drone. The save DC is Charisma-based. Siphon (Su) Any creature bitten by a coloxus must make a DC 23 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Charisma damage. A coloxus heals itself of 5 points of damage for every point of Charisma damage it deals. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Coloxus demons, known also as fly demons, resemble humans with the head of a fly and twin pairs of gossamer wings. Even their smallest movements and gestures seem infused with manic quickness and alertness. A coloxus prefers to wear opulent clothing and jewels that would rival the wealthiest nobility of any race. A coloxus is 6 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds. Ironically-given their grotesque, insectile appearance-coloxus demons are demons of vanity. They are formed from the souls of narcissistic mortals responsible for disasters or tragedy through their careless self-absorption. Despite their foul appearance, coloxus demons consider themselves cultured and elite. They are unusually patient and well mannered for demons, and as a result are often used as emissaries, diplomats, and negotiators by marilith generals, balors, and even demon lords. Even when facing hated foes, coloxus demons are the epitome of courtesy, but such manners are always a deceitful veneer, masking the creatures' efforts to gain the upper hand. Evil mortal spellcasters are fond of conjuring coloxus demons for similar roles, but the monsters also work well as assassins. Even in this role, a coloxus is dignified and polite. Only when presented with a ref lection of itself does the normally civilized coloxus show its true demonic colors-any creature foolish enough to trick a coloxus into looking at a mirror finds herself the eternal foe of an insulted and scandalized demon.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Pain Redoubled (Su) When an incubus confirms a critical hit with a melee weapon or a natural weapon, that attack deals an additional 2d6 points of nonlethal damage and the target must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or be wracked by pain, becoming sickened for 1d6 rounds. Multiple uses of this ability extend the duration. The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>An incubus in his true form is always muscular and attractive, with long hair and intense eyes. His skin can be of any color, but is always smooth and silky. When not using his wings for flight, an incubus can fold them to drape across its shoulders like a cloak-many decorate both the inside and outside of their wings with tattoos, ink, or self-inflicted scars. Incubi stand between 6 and 6-1/2 feet tall and typically weigh 200 pounds. When not in battle, incubi serve as counselors, torturers, and companions for greater demons. They are also often conjured for similar roles by mortal spellcasters, although care must be taken in dalliances with incubi, for they delight in causing pain to their companions. Like succubi, incubi form from the chaotic evil souls of particularly lustful and rapacious mortals. Yet whereas succubi are subtle and methodical about using their charms to cause ruin, the typical incubus is forthright and forceful about his insatiable desires.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Disease (Ex) A schir gnaws constantly at the ends of its halberd. This infuses the blades with disease from the demon's filthy spittle. Any creature struck by a schir's halberd must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or contract gray pox-a frightening disease that causes weakness, gray splotches on the skin, and eventual catatonia. The save DC is Constitution-based. Gray Pox: Halberd-injury; save Fort DC 15; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d6 Str damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>A schir resembles a tall, muscular humanoid with the head and hooves of a demonic goat. A ragged hide covers patches of a schir's body, usually around the forearms and lower legs, with a crestlike patch running down from the creature's crown to the nape of its neck. Schir demons are 7 feet tall, though they usually stoop and so appear shorter, and weigh 300 pounds. Also known as spite demons, schirs are among the most violent and vile-tempered inhabitants of the Abyss. Schirs are formed from the souls of mortals who either committed or framed others for heinous crimes-acts committed for the sole purpose of petty retribution. Despite such origins, schirs occupy one of the lowest orders in the demonic hierarchy, often serving as front-line infantry in demonic armies or as guards for minor demonic commanders. Although not especially intelligent, schirs are cunning warriors and able sentries. Although they prefer to charge into combat, a schir's natural jumping ability makes it a nimble enemy, capable of using its surroundings astutely. A schir will often jump on top of rocks, crumbling walls, or any other high place to hack with its disease-ridden halberd. For all of schirs' capabilities, their spitefulness makes them distrustful of any creature that has not proven its greater power and strength numerous times. A schir set loose upon the Material Plane quickly seeks to set itself up as a leader of its own army- often, schirs seek out tribes of savage humanoids and attempt to replace the current leaders. They are particularly fond of infiltrating gnoll tribes.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Aerial Charge (Ex) When airborne, a derhii can dive at twice its normal flying speed. This is the equivalent of a charge, granting a +2 bonus on the attack roll and a -2 penalty to AC. Booming Voice (Ex) A derhii can use its own booming voice as a signal. The sound can be heard up to 12 miles away as a thrumming in the air that conveys 20 words of information in 5 minutes. Knockdown (Ex) When a derhii confirms a critical hit with a two-handed weapon, it has a chance to knock an opponent prone in addition to the damage dealt by the critical hit. If the derhii's confirmation roll exceeds its opponent's CMD, the opponent is knocked prone as if from the trip combat maneuver. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity, nor can the derhii be tripped if the confirmation roll fails to exceed the CMD.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The derhii, or flying ape, is a carnivorous and dangerous form of the gentler earthbound ape. Derhii resemble gorillas with the enormous black-and-gray wings of buzzards or vultures. They stand 9 feet tall and weigh 400 pounds. Derhii form relatively small groupings known as troops, which usually consist of a single adult male, several adult females, and their offspring. Occasionally, multiple males or females band together in single-gender troops with no young, but such groupings are usually formed for a specific purpose, such as hunting, raiding, or war, and break up when they have fulfilled that purpose. Multiple troops of derhii form large primitive tribes, usually under the rule of a single powerful chieftain. Derhii often roost in jungle canopies and in cliff dwellings, preferring nests woven in tall trees or cliff-side caves high above ground level. From these roosts, derhii sometimes demand tribute from lesser apes, while allying themselves with even more powerful flying creatures, such as dragons or dragonnes. Occasionally, derhii can be found inhabiting crumbling and overgrown ruins hidden deep in the jungle. Derhii are carnivorous by nature and hunters by preference, attacking prey from high above with javelins thrown from their powerful arms before descending to finish things off with their blades, but when meat is scarce, they eat fruits and roots or whatever else they can forage.</Description>

    <Description_Visual>With rust-colored skin and a jutting crown of ridge-like horns, this muscular devil is draped in lengthy contracts.</Description_Visual>

    <Source>PFRPG Bestiary 3</Source>
    <IsTemplate>0</IsTemplate>
    <SpecialAbilities>Binding Contract (Su) All contract devils carry numerous lengthy contracts draped over their horns or within their numerous carrying cases. They can wield these contracts like whips, but deal lethal damage regardless of the armor bonus of their target. A contract devil modifies attack and damage rolls when using a binding contract by its Intelligence modifier, not its Strength modifier (this equates to a +7 bonus for most contract devils). Wounds created by a binding contract resemble horrifically deep paper cuts and cause 1d6 points of bleed damage. A contract devil can use its binding contract to disarm and trip foes as if the contract were a whip. If it is itself disarmed of the contract, the devil can rearm itself with a new contract as an immediate action. Impale (Ex) As a swift action, a contract devil can impale an opponent grappled by its binding contract, dealing 2d8+4 points of piercing damage. Infernal Contract (Su) As a full-round action, a contract devil can produce an infernal contract for a single living mortal creature. This contract can grant a wide range of abilities and effects, as detailed on the following page. To receive any of these bonuses, however, the mortal must sign its true name to the document of its own free will. Upon doing so, that mortal's soul is sworn to the contract devil, condemning the soul to an eternity of servitude in Hell rather than whatever fate would naturally befall it upon the mortal's death. Breaking a contract with a contract devil is difficult and dangerous (see the next page); as long as the infernal contract remains in effect, the victim cannot be restored to life after death save by a miracle or a wish. If a mortal is restored to life in this way, the contract devil immediately senses the development-it not only knows which soul has been restored to life, but also gains the benefits of a discern location spell targeted on the character or creature that restored the damned soul to life. Infernal Investment (Su) As a subclause of all infernal contracts, a contract devil can use greater scrying at will upon any creature it has a contract with. The target creature always fails its save against the devil's scrying attempt-this ability otherwise functions at caster level 20th.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>A contract devil, also a called phistophilus, always appears handsome and confident, its chiseled features housing a perpetually smug grin. Contract devils have red skin and black hair and stand near 6-1/2 feet in height, not counting their horns. The thicket of horns around a contract devil's body increases its height to 7 feet and its weight to 350 pounds. Contract devils serve Asmodeus, archfiends, and the vast bureaucracy of Hell as clerks, scribes, and bargainers for mortal souls. They exist to keep track of the damned, to manage Hell's endless ordinances, and, when time and opportunity permit, to coax mortals into damnation. Most phistophiluses spend their eternities in the various courts of Hell's nine layers, particularly in the maze-like fortress-libraries where all infernal laws and oaths are recorded. Occasionally they serve similar roles on the Material Plane when summoned by particularly desperate, arrogant, or foolish mortals. When one of the souls damned by a contract devil is restored to life (typically via powerful magic like a wish or miracle), the phistophilus immediately notices the transgression. Usually, the contract devil recruits the aid of more powerful allies to track down and punish such transgressors and to collect the escaped soul as quickly as possible. INFERNAL CONTRACTS While numerous types of infernal contracts exist, the following two are those most often offered to mortals by contract devils. Evil Wishes: Upon signing this contract, a mortal is granted three wishes, as per the spell. It must use these wishes within 24 hours of signing the contract-if it does not, the wishes are wasted but it remains bound to the contract nevertheless. While the mortal chooses the intention of the wishes, the contract devil decides upon the specifics, allowing for its own diabolical interpretation of the results should the mortal imprecisely phrase a wish. Infernal Slave: A mortal can negotiate with a contract devil for the lifelong service of a devil. The mortal chooses any type of devil (except for a contract devil) of a CR equal to or less than its own character level at the time of the bargain. Upon signing the contract, the mortal's infernal slave appears and is bound to do the mortal no harm and follow its orders for as long as it lives. Although the devil must obey its master's commands, many devils delight in corrupting the intentions of these orders in all manner of cruel or mischievous ways. BREAKING AN INFERNAL CONTRACT An agreement with a contract devil can only be broken in two ways. When a contract is signed, a second copy manifests; one copy is retained by the devil and the other is given to the mortal. Mortals are free to do whatever they please with the lengthy, obviously evil documents, while contract devils typically keep active contracts with them at all times. Should both copies of a contract be destroyed, any effects caused by the contract are canceled or reversed and the mortal's soul goes to its normal place of rest after death and can be resurrected as normal. Merely absconding with both copies of the contract is not enough to break the contract-as long as both copies exist, the signer's soul remains forever damned. Alternatively, a second mortal might be allowed to adopt the terms of a contract-with its soul replacing that of the original contract signer after death. The mortal who seeks to pay the debt of another must contact the contract devil who holds the relevant contract. The contract devil has a choice of whether or not to allow one mortal to pay another's debt, but values religious and good-aligned souls over others. Shrewd manipulators, contract devils often only agree to allow one mortal to pay another's debt in return for some service or proof of worth. If a contract devil agrees to accept another soul in payment, the original contract signer retains all of the benefits of the contract, but is released from damnation and may be resurrected as normal. The new signer, however, receives no benefits, cannot be returned to life upon dying, and spends an eternity in Hell after death.</Description>

    <Description>Iguanodons are large, herbivorous dinosaurs that inhabit swamps and forests where they can take advantage of abundant vegetation. The iguanodon is capable of moving on two feet or on four, quickly switching from one stance to the other, depending on whether it needs to move through dense foliage or to reach delectable morsels hanging up in the canopy. Although iguanodons are herbivores, they are notoriously quick to anger. Their thumb spikes make their claws particularly devastating weapons-a well-placed blow from one of these claws can turn a hungry predator into a cowering beast with one swift strike. Iguanodons are 30 feet long and weigh 6,000 pounds.

    <SpecialAbilities>Clobbering Charge (Ex) When a pachycephalosaurus hits a target with its slam attack at the end of a charge, it can initiate a bull rush as a free action to move the struck target back in the same direction as the dinosaur's charge. The pachycephalosaurus cannot move with the target of the bull rush. If a pachycephalosaurus scores a critical hit against a creature with its slam attack at the end of a charge, it also staggers the target for 1 round. If the victim succeeds at a DC 18 Fortitude save, the stagger effect is negated, but the victim still suffers the effects of the dinosaur's bull rush attempt. The save DC is Strength-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>A pachycephalosaurus is a normally peaceful dinosaur that grows irate and violent during mating season or when its herd is intruded upon by potential predators. The dinosaur's skull has a distinctive dome-shaped crown surrounded by numerous bony horns- this, combined with the dinosaur's powerful, compact neck, allows it to make battering-ram-like charges capable of inf licting great damage. Pachycephalosauruses grow to a length of 15 feet and weigh 1,400 pounds.

    <SpecialAbilities>Leap (Ex) A dire corby can perform a special kind of pounce attack by jumping into combat. When a dire corby charges, it can make a DC 20 Acrobatics check to jump into the air and land next to its enemies. If it succeeds at this Acrobatics check, it can make a full attack (two claw attacks, plus a rend attack if both claws hit) against foes in reach. If it fails, it can still make its one attack as normal for a charge.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Dire corbies are subterranean predators that resemble humanoid crows with muscular arms and fearsome claws. Though they make their cliff-side homes on the walls of underground chasms, where they climb and leap with death-defying agility, they are most frequently encountered in the tunnels where they wait to ambush prey, leaping down from the ceiling to rend and tear. Dire corbies are intelligent, but have little use for society outside of the rough, squabbling pecking order of their rookeries, where their social order is little better than that of the</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Disenchant (Ex) A disenchanter can use its trunk to make a melee touch attack against a target's worn, held, or carried magic item in an attempt to drink the item's magic. The disenchanter makes a caster level check (+4) opposed by the target's Fortitude save. If the check succeeds, the disenchanter drains the item's magic, rendering it nonmagical. To determine which of a target's magic items is affected, use Table 9-2 on page 216 of the Core Rulebook (though a disenchanter never uses this ability on a headband or similar head-slot item unless it has first tried to wear the item). Disenchanters may instead target specific visible items, in which case they generally target the most obvious items. Artifacts are immune to this ability. Disenchant only works against objects that a disenchanter can touch, and even a thin layer of cloth effectively protects items from it. Power Spray (Su) Once per day, a disenchanter can release a 20-foot cone-shaped burst of raw magical energy through its trunk. Creatures in the cone take 4d6 points of damage (DC 14 Reflex save for half ). Creatures immune to magic effects that allow spell resistance (such as golems) are immune to this ability. The save DC is Constitution-based. Vulnerable to Dispel Magic (Ex) A disenchanter targeted by dispel magic takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d6, Fortitude save for half). Greater dispel magic functions similarly (maximum 20d6 damage, Fortitude save for half).</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>A disenchanter is a blue-furred creature that resembles a single-humped camel with a prehensile trunk. The creatures can sense magic, which they consume for sustenance, draining the power of magic items and storing their magical energy in their humps. Disenchanters are social creatures, and often seek the companionship of other intelligent beings, making excellent mounts and trackers for treasure hunters. A typical disenchanter is 8 feet long and weighs 1,600 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Cursed Gaze (Su) Aghash's choice: confused for 1 round, shaken for 1 round, stunned for 1 round, or deals 1d4 points of damage, 30 feet, Fortitude DC 16 negates. Any creature under the effects of protection from evil is immune to an aghash's gaze. The save DC is Charisma-based. Sandstorm (Su) Once per day, as a full-round action, an aghash can create a temporary sandstorm. This storm has a radius of 100 feet centered on the aghash and lasts for 1 minute per Hit Die the aghash possesses (typically 5). This functions as a sandstorm (Core Rulebook 431).</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Aghashes embody the evil eye, a curse granted by merely witnessing these embodiments of ruin and misfortune. Terrifying, haglike beings, aghashes wander deserts of the Material Plane spreading doom with their gazes. These wretched creatures hold nothing sacred, taking particular pleasure in bringing vain and arrogant mortals, particularly spellcasters, to ruin. Ragged and filthy, an aghash moves with a staggering motion. Its hoofed legs bend like those of a goat, giving its emaciated frame an obscene, jerking gait. All divs exhibit some manner of compulsion, and aghashes' is to despise beautiful mortals. If given a choice between attacking two different opponents, an aghash always chooses the most physically becoming foe. Such is their loathing-or, perhaps, jealousy-that an aghash might stalk attractive foes, delighting in aff licting them with curses that sap their Charisma or otherwise undermines their charm. With its spectral hand ability an aghash can deliver curses from a distance, leading some victims to believe they've been aff licted by a disease or cursed by the gods themselves. All the while, the aghash lingers nearby, delighting in the suffering it has caused. An aghash stands between 5 and 6 feet tall and weighs about 100 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Armor Training (Ex) An akvan is created wearing armor, and is naturally experienced in its use. An akvan possesses the armor training ability of a 15th-level fighter. Aura of Hopelessness (Su) All creatures within 30 feet of an akvan must make a successful DC 30 Will save or take a -4 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. Create Ghul (Su) Any genie that is slain by an akvan becomes a ghul (see page 125) in 1d4 rounds. Such ghuls are under the command of the akvan that created them and remain enslaved until it dies, at which point they become free-willed ghuls. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life. Shake Faith (Su) Anytime an akvan strikes a divine spellcaster with any of its melee attacks, the target must make a DC 30 Will save or be shaken for 1d4 rounds. If the save is successful, the target is instead shaken for 1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based. Torturous Gullet (Su) As hunters of otherworldly beings, akvans are uniquely drawn to digest creatures with a variety of resistances. In addition to the damage dealt by crushing internal organs, creatures swallowed by an akvan take 4d6 points of acid, cold, electricity, or fire damage per round. The akvan chooses what type of energy damage those in its stomach will take every round, and may change this from round to round. Additionally, an akvan's stomach is thickly armored, allowing it to benefit from its entire natural armor bonus instead of merely half.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Akvans number among the most physically powerful and openly destructive servants of Ahriman, directly carrying out his ancient plans for oblivion. Their twisted minds bend toward desolation, ruin, and blasphemy, and their hatred of the gods of creation and beings renowned for inspiring art and wonder knows few equals. Whereas most divs turn their cruelty and vengefulness exclusively upon mortals, akvans broaden the scope of their hatred to encompass geniekind as well. Akvans seek out wonders to destroy-monuments from lost ages that have long inspired awe and pride or beings and establishments said to be invincible. While divs typically spread their taint through more subtle ways, akvans target symbols for destruction, bringing down not just stone and mortar but hopes and dreams. Additionally, these masters of destruction promote the creation of new horrors, transforming their most hated victims, genies, into nightmares known as ghuls. Thus, an akvan's evil does not end with its victim's death, as slain genies arise from the battlefield-or are belched up from an akvan's gullet-as blasphemous undead servants. These undead minions serve their terrifying master and, over the ages, gather around it as an army of profane slaves. Hatred and hunger for genies and those allied with them constitute the racial compulsion to which all akvans bow. These divs always go out of their way to hunt, destroy, and consume any genie they encounter. While wise enough to not waste their lives in combat against foes obviously more powerful then they, akvans seek to bring low any such opponents, if not by brute strength, then by guile. Akvans stand approximately 40 feet tall and weigh over 30,000 pounds. AKVAN PRINCES As akvans go through existence slaying mortals and genies, many gravitate toward one of the races of geniekind, targeting members of that race with particular passion. Over ages of service, akvans who prove especially lethal in slaughtering genies garner the attention of Ahriman, who blesses such divs with increased power, transforming them into akvan princes. Each akvan prince dedicates itself to extinguishing a particular type of genie and gains special abilities with which to slaughter genies of that type. An akvan prince gains an additional 4-8 Hit Dice, a +4 bonus to three ability scores, and has a CR of 22-24. The akvan prince also gains one of the following sets of abilities, depending on what type of genies it hunts. Crumbling Earth: A shaitan-hunting akvan prince shatters the strongest stone. It gains the stone glide ability, tremorsense 100 feet, and a burrow speed of 100 feet, and its natural attacks are treated as adamantine for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. It also gains the following spell-like abilities: 3/day-quickened stone shape, transmute mud to rock, transmute rock to mud, wish. Dying Ember: An efreet-hating akvan prince holds dominion over flame. It gains resist fire 30, an efreeti's heat special attack (1d6 when struck, 6d6 when grappling or grappled), and the following spell-like abilities: at will-quickened quench, scorching ray, wall of fire; 3/day-wish. Gasping Wind: A djinn-hunting akvan prince gains power over the wind. It gains resist electricity 30 and the whirlwind ability, its fly speed increases to 120 feet (perfect maneuverability), and it gains the following spell-like abilities: at will-invisibility; 3/day-gaseous form, wish. Thirsty Sea: A marid-slaying akvan prince controls and poisons water. It gains a swim speed of 100 feet, a marid's water's fury special attack (8d6 points of damage, blinds and stuns for 1d6 rounds), and the following spell-like abilities: constant-water breathing, water walk; at will- quickened control water; 3/day-horrid wilting, wish. Unbalanced Soul: A jann-killing akvan prince spreads failure and defeat. It gains resist acid, cold, and electricity 20, and the following spell-like abilities: at will-ethereal jaunt, invisibility; 3/day-insanity, mage's disjunction, wish.</Description>

    <Description>Dorus are the divs that whisper in the night, the foul inspiration that drifts upon fetid winds, the messengers of pretender gods. Wild hair whips around a doru's six twisting horns, while a flat nose, a fanged mouth, and red glowing eyes complete the terrifying image of this bodiless monstrosity. Dorus almost always fly, preferring to stay at heights that keep them at the eye level of those with whom they would have dealings. When not flying, dorus roll across the ground in a disturbing manner, horns bouncing and teeth clattering as the creatures cackle and cartwheel, terrifying children and shocking the faint of heart. The least of the divs, dorus serve as messengers and servants of other divs and sometimes mortal spellcasters. While not strong combatants, dorus prefer to sow ruin in more subtle ways. They enjoy tainting mortals with exaggerated news and outright lies, trying to turn impressionable beings to waste and wickedness. Even if a doru fails to fully corrupt an intelligent being itself, it attempts to weaken the target's will, making the victim more pliable to future corruption and ruin. All divs have some manner of esoteric flaw in their personalities- dorus are obsessed with secrets. These covetous fiends hoard secrets and legends like a miser hoards gold. This thirst for information causes the curious dorus to enter into ridiculous bargains to obtain hidden knowledge from those they believe hold tales of special interest or value, especially when such information has the potential to aid in the corruption of future souls. Such bargains are usually what seal dorus to servitude, whether their service be to other divs or to mortal spellcasters. Cunning creatures, dorus often act as double (and sometimes triple) agents, but they rarely maintain this complex series of lies and deceptions for long. Dorus abhor mortals, as all divs do, and find it difficult to remain obedient to such beings for more than a span of a few decades at most. Only the most precious and profane secrets have the potential to keep a doru faithful to a mortal master for more than a century. Serving greater divs or mortal spellcasters, divs deliver messages, most directly plucked from secret sources. Dorus' spell-like abilities make them excellent spies, granting them the ability to infiltrate, eavesdrop while invisible, and charm their way out of perilous situations. Those serving mortals pride themselves on manipulating their masters into furthering the divs' own ends. Many evil spellcasters seeking profane power and ancient evil secrets seek to take dorus as familiars. A neutral evil spellcaster of at least 7th level who takes the Improved Familiar feat can select a doru as a familiar.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Boiling Sea (Su) As a standard action, a ghawwas can cause the waters around it to boil. Any creature within 50 feet of the ghawwas, within the same body of water, and at least half submerged takes 6d6 points of heat damage (DC 22 Fortitude save for half). The save DC is Constitution-based. Poison (Ex) Sting-injury; save Fort DC 23; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Str; cure 2 consecutive saves. Rough Hide (Ex) Ghawwas have rough hides studded with jagged barbs and spiny protrusions. Any creature striking a ghawwas with a natural weapon or an unarmed strike takes 1d6 points of slashing and piercing damage.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Full of poison and treachery, ghawwas foul the seas and seek to bring ruin to those who dwell there. Ghawwas resemble a mixture of hulking humanoid, prehistoric fish, and poisonous bottom-feeder. While most ghawwas live in salt water, they sometimes teleport to oases to defile them or suck them dry. Although they see all mortals as enemies, ghawwas bear a particular grudge against peaceable, water-breathing creatures such as merfolk and locathah. All ghawwas find the tolling of bells insufferable, the sound filling them with rage and driving them to seek out the source and destroy either the bell or those ringing it. The typical ghawwas stands 12 feet tall and weighs close to 1,200 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Disease (Su) A pairaka carries two diseases. Its claws infect targets with bubonic plague, and any willing contact with its skin (such as through caressing, grappling, or more) exposes victims to the shakes. Bubonic Plague: Claw-injury; save Fort DC 17; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Str damage, 1 Cha damage, and target is fatigued; cure 2 consecutive saves. Shakes: Contact; save Fort DC 13; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d8 Dex damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. Lustful Dreams (Su) Pairakas can torment sleeping creatures. While an intelligent creature sleeps, a pairaka can slip into the target's mind and twist its dreams to lusty nocturnal visions. The victim must be asleep for the pairaka to use this ability and the pairaka must be within 100 feet. If the victim fails a DC 21 Will save, it experiences vivid hallucinations of a lurid nature that leave it breathless and fatigued upon waking. The victim, even a depraved soul, rarely considers the sexual nature of these dreams enjoyable, as the images exploit any number of taboos the pairaka suspects its victim might harbor. The save DC is Charisma-based. Creatures that do not sleep or dream are immune to this effect.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>A sensual pairing of seduction and destruction, pairakas embody the corruptive nature of unbridled lust. Pairakas spend little time in their true form while on the Material Plane, choosing to cloak themselves instead in alluring forms to seduce potential victims, ruin relationships, and foment obsession. In its true form, a pairaka's body is a foul landscape of blazing rashes, oozing pustules, and taut blisters suggestive of the corruptions it harbors, bodily and spiritually. Pairakas pride themselves on perversion. They love nothing more than turning lovers against one another or destroying the bonds of friendship. Pairakas feed off this slow torment and savor each broken heart or disappointment. They use lust and sexuality as their primary tools, wielding taboos and carnal appetites to sever once-friendly relationships. Pairakas also use their seduction to spread disease, charming victims into physical contact. Just as all other divs suffer a weakness, pairakas cannot stand the color red. They never wear the color or enter a place that is painted red, and they always attack creatures that are garbed in clothes of a crimson hue first. Pairakas stand 6 feet tall and weigh around 150 pounds. Their skin color varies widely between individuals.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Deflect Rays (Su) Once per round as an immediate action, a sepid can use its Deflect Arrows feat to deflect a ray or a spell that uses a ranged touch attack. Rain of Debris (Su) Three times per day as a standard action, a sepid can call forth a hail of stones, wood, metal, and similar debris. The debris rains down and pelts all creatures in a 10-foot-high, 40-foot-radius cylinder centered on the sepid, dealing 15d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 25 for half ). This attack does not harm the sepid, and counts as an evil attack for the purpose of damage reduction. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Warlords among the divs, sepids spread fear, slaughter, and despair wherever they pass. They foster battles, incite rebellions, and seek heroes to slay, destroying all that which gives common people hope. With their falchions in hand, sepids often stand at the fore of the foul legions they raise. Sepids delight in twisting the truth, but while all divs are liars, sepids make themselves predictable by always doing the opposite of what they claim, and wise opponents turn this knowledge to their own advantage. Sepids stand 13 feet tall and weigh upward of 1,500 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Consume Essence (Su) A shira's deadliest attacks drain away a portion of its victim's essence. Whenever a shira hits with a coup de grace attack using its bite, or confirms a critical hit with its claws or bite, the target must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Constitution drain. The save is Constitution-based. Dusty Pelt (Ex) A shira collects and produces copious amounts of dust and ash within the coarse hairs of its furry hide. As a move action, it can shake itself, creating a cloud of dust that fills its space, providing it concealment. Any attack that deals at least 10 points of bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage to the shira (before DR) automatically activates this ability. The dust cloud lasts for 1 round. A light wind disperses this cloud immediately.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Bestial stalkers, shiras live to hunt and feed. Resembling anthropomorphic lionesses, these divs use their powerful builds, keen senses, and deadly instincts to track the proudest mortals and slay the most formidable foes. They embody the deadly nature of the wilds and the dispassion with which beast and land might turn against mortals, delighting in proving to civilized beings how small and helpless they are in the face of a savage world. Shiras prefer hunting alone, keeping company with even others of their own kind only long enough to form temporary hunting bands. With a hunger for intelligent prey, they savor the taste of mortal souls, savaging not just victims' bodies but also their vital essences. Despite being the most feral of all divs, shiras sometimes serve as scouts and assassins for div hordes. Such arrangements usually prove to be temporary, however, lasting only until the shiras' savage instincts or lust for the hunt again takes hold. Shiras never go after an easy kill, and instead target the most obviously powerful of the possible targets. When acting on this compulsion, a shira weighs its chances for survival and the glory of its intended kill, planning its tactics carefully and not necessarily charging savagely forth. Though savage, a shira is also a cunning hunter and might wait weeks for the perfect opportunity to bring down its chosen prey. Most shiras stand 10 feet tall and weigh approximately 1,200 pounds.</Description>

Creatures affected by euphoria are staggered, sickened, and immune to fear effects for the duration. A faerie dragon can use this breath weapon once every 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. Spells A faerie dragon casts spells as a 3rd-level sorcerer.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Related to pseudodragons, faerie dragons are whimsical, playful pranksters that spend most of their time either relaxing in cool forest glades or engaged in some sort of prank. Although such mischief is usually spontaneous, some faerie dragons have been known to spend months or even years in preparation of one truly spectacular joke. Travelers making their way through lands known to be inhabited by these good-natured-but sometimes annoying-tricksters are advised to keep up their guard lest they face all manner of creative annoyances (horses painted with berry juice, squirrels placed inside bedrolls, and clothing decorating high branches being a few examples). Unlike true dragons, faerie dragons do not grow larger with age, but their scales do change color, starting with red and moving through the rainbow to reach dark violet at old age. Faerie dragons grow in power as spellcasters as they age (typically gaining levels in sorcerer), learning more powerful spells to complement their innate abilities. The spells of faerie dragons tend to focus on tools that can be used to create or enhance pranks, and illusion and enchantment spells are particularly popular. Faerie dragons avoid combat unless there is no other option. If forced to fight, faerie dragons attempt to confound enemies rather than kill them, using both spells and breath weapon to weaken and scatter foes before fleeing. The only exception to this is when a faerie dragon's clan or allies are in danger. As capricious as these tiny dragons can be, many prove quick to bond with goodly creatures, especially fey and others they find interesting or hilarious-adventurers often fall into this latter camp, particularly those most outraged by a faerie dragon's tricks. Faerie dragons sometimes ally with spellcasters, serving as curious, occasionally reckless, but always true familiars. An arcane spellcaster of at least 7th level with an alignment within 1 step of chaotic good who has the Improved Familiar feat may select a faerie dragon as a familiar.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Change Shape (Su) An adult or older forest dragon can assume any humanoid form three times per day as if using polymorph. Destructive Crush (Su) When an old or older forest dragon makes a crush attack, the impact kicks up debris in a 20-foot-radius burst for 1d6 rounds. The debris obscures the vision of creatures within the debris field and grants concealment to those creatures. The forest dragon can see normally within and through the debris field. Elemental Breath (Su) Once per day, when an ancient or older forest dragon uses its breath weapon, it can summon a greater earth elemental within the cone. The caster level for these effects is the same as the dragon's caster level. Sound Imitation (Ex) A very young or older forest dragon can mimic any voice or sound it has heard by making a successful Bluff check against the listener's Sense Motive check. Stony Death (Su) Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by a great wyrm forest dragon's breath weapon must also make a Fortitude save (same DC as the forest dragon's breath weapon) or be petrified as the flesh to stone spell. This is a death effect. Woodland Stride (Ex) As the druid ability of the same name.</SpecialAbilities>

    <SpecialAbilities>Borne Aloft (Su) Old or younger sky dragons fly with good maneuverability while all older sky dragons have perfect. Celestial Emissary (Su) Three times per day, a great wyrm sky dragon can imbue others with the celestial aspect of the oracle spell divine vessel*, but it can only be cast on another willing creature of good alignment. Change Shape (Su) A young or older sky dragon can assume any humanoid form three times per day as if using polymorph. Cloud Sight (Su) A very young or older sky dragon's sight is not impeded by clouds or fog, or by spells that create areas of fog. Grounding Breath (Su) Any flying creature damaged by the breath weapon of an ancient or older sky dragon must make a Fortitude save with the same DC as the sky dragon's breath weapon or lose the ability to fly for 1d4 rounds. Primal Lightning (Su) An old or older sky dragon's breath weapon can affect creatures normally immune or resistant to electricity damage. A creature immune to electricity damage still takes half damage from the breath weapon (no damage with a successful saving throw). Resistant creatures' electricity resistance is treated as 10 less than normal.</SpecialAbilities>

    <SpecialAbilities>Change Shape (Su) A young or older sovereign dragon can assume any humanoid form three times per day as polymorph. Dogmatic Discordance (Su) Good or evil creatures take a -2 penalty when making saving throws against a sovereign dragon's spells, spell-like abilities, breath weapon, and aura. Golden Armor (Su) Once per day as a standard action, an old or older sovereign dragon can cover its form in golden armor, granting it a +4 armor bonus to AC and energy resistance 15 to one energy type, chosen at the time the armor is summoned. This armor lasts for a number of rounds equal to the dragon's age category. The sovereign dragon can dismiss the armor as a free action. Master Counterspelling (Su) A great wyrm sovereign dragon can counterspell once per round as an immediate action. It need not know the spell it is countering, but can instead expend any spell that is one level higher to automatically counter the spell. Violent Retort (Ex) When a young or older sovereign dragon takes damage from a melee attack critical hit, it can, as an immediate action, make a claw or tail slap attack against the creature that made the critical hit.</SpecialAbilities>

    <SpecialAbilities>Change Shape (Su) A young or older sovereign dragon can assume any humanoid form three times per day as polymorph. Dogmatic Discordance (Su) Good or evil creatures take a -2 penalty when making saving throws against a sovereign dragon's spells, spell-like abilities, breath weapon, and aura. Golden Armor (Su) Once per day as a standard action, an old or older sovereign dragon can cover its form in golden armor, granting it a +4 armor bonus to AC and energy resistance 15 to one energy type, chosen at the time the armor is summoned. This armor lasts for a number of rounds equal to the dragon's age category. The sovereign dragon can dismiss the armor as a free action. Master Counterspelling (Su) A great wyrm sovereign dragon can counterspell once per round as an immediate action. It need not know the spell it is countering, but can instead expend any spell that is one level higher to automatically counter the spell. Violent Retort (Ex) When a young or older sovereign dragon takes damage from a melee attack critical hit, it can, as an immediate action, make a claw or tail slap attack against the creature that made the critical hit.</SpecialAbilities>

    <SpecialAbilities>Adamantine Claws (Ex) The claws of an underworld dragon are made of adamantine, and have the qualities of a weapon made from that material. Change Shape (Su) A young or older underworld dragon can assume any humanoid form three times per day as if using polymorph. Lava Eruption (Su) As a full-round action, a great wyrm underworld dragon can burrow through the ground up to twice its burrow speed. At the end of that movement, if the underworld dragon has use of its breath weapon, it can emerge from the ground spouting lava in a 30-foot-radius burst, dealing damage as the breath weapon. Smoke Vision (Ex) A very young and older underworld dragon can see perfectly in smoky conditions (such as those created by pyrotechnics). Underworld Burrower (Ex) An adult underworld dragon gains a 10-foot bonus to its burrow speed. When the underworld dragon becomes old and every two age categories thereafter, its burrow speed increases by an additional 10 feet.</SpecialAbilities>

    <SpecialAbilities>Roar (Su) A dragonne can unleash a devastating roar every 1d4 rounds as a standard action. All creatures except dragonnes within 120 feet must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or become fatigued. Those within 30 feet who fail their saves are also deafened for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Possessing the savage instincts of lions with the cunning of brass dragons, dragonnes combine the fiercest features of these noble creatures into predators both awe-inspiring and deadly. The origin of dragonnes generates endless speculation. The odds of these creatures being direct crossbreeds of dragons and lions are quite remote, for numerous reasons: the two creatures rarely share the same territories; few creatures as clever as brass dragons would choose to mate with simple lions; and dragonne abilities differ significantly from those of metallic dragons. While otherworldly breeding experiments and magical mishaps remain possibilities, few satisfying explanations make themselves apparent. Although many creatures rightly fear these ferocious hunters, few dragonnes are blatantly evil-most are just highly territorial and seek to defend their homes and hunting grounds from interlopers. Creatures that draw too close to a dragonne's lair are typically met by the resident's fearsome roar, followed by its claws and fangs if this warning is ignored. Those who attempt to settle in a dragonne's territory find themselves harassed constantly until they decide to leave or the dragonne is slain. These intimidating predators spend the majority of their time on the ground, even when in combat, since their wings prove somewhat ungainly. They typically search for prey and intruders from the air, then land nearby to charge and pounce. Despite their deadliness, dragonnes form strong bonds with those they consider members of their pride, sometimes even adopting creatures of other races. A character with the Leadership feat can take a dragonne as a cohort. Such characters must have an effective leadership level of 10th. Most dragonne cohorts gain levels in barbarian, fighter, or ranger. A dragonne measures between 10 and 12 feet long and weighs up to 1,200 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Dazzling Emergence (Ex) During a surprise round, a desert drake can use Dazzling Display as a standard action. Sandstorm Breath (Su) As a standard action, a desert drake can spit a ball of electrically charged sand that bursts into a cloud. This attack has a range of 60 feet and deals 3d6 points of damage plus 4d8 points of electricity damage in a 15-foot-radius spread (Reflex DC 19 for half ). The cloud acting as obscuring mist. Once a desert drake uses its breath, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. Savage Bite (Ex) A desert drake applies 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier to damage dealt with its bite attack, and it threatens a critical hit on a 19-20. Speed Surge (Ex) Three times per day as a swift action, a desert drake can draw on its draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed that allows it to take an additional move action that round.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Among the fiercest of their kind, desert drakes exhibit a lust for destruction as merciless as any desert storm. These fierce, ambush predators hunt by finding high perches among rocky outcroppings and surveying their surroundings. When likely prey wanders into sight, a desert drake dives into the sand and burrows toward its quarry or flies low with cover from dunes or other outcroppings. Drawing near the likely path of its victims, it bursts from the sand or dives from above to catch foes off guard, preferring to attack targets that exhibit the most fear first. Before enemies can recover from the initial onslaught, a desert drake exhales a cloud of electrified dust, using its superior senses to press the attack. Mated pairs of desert drakes hunt larger prey and groups of victims, and rampages of the beasts might gather near overland trade routes to devour whole caravans. A typical desert drake measures 15 feet long from nose to tail tip, has a supple, wormlike build, and weighs about 2,500 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Clinging Corrosion (Su) As a standard action, a rift drake can spit a ball of caustic gas that bursts into a cloud upon impact. This attack has a range of 60 feet and deals 5d10 points of acid damage to all creatures within the resulting 15-foot-radius spread. Additionally, any creature damaged by this attack is affected as though by the spell slow for 1d4 rounds. A successful DC 20 Reflex save halves the damage and negates the slowing effect. Once a rift drake uses its breath weapon, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. Savage Bite (Ex) A rift drake applies 1-1/2 times its Strength bonus to damage dealt with its bite attack, and it threatens a critical hit on a 19-20. Speed Surge (Ex) Three times per day as a swift action, a rift drake can draw on its draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed that allows it to take an additional move action that round.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Creatures of the badlands and regions scarred by the gods, rift drakes are as savage and brutal as the lands they hunt. Their strength and savagery often make them seem like mere deadly beasts, but rift drakes simply delight in battle more than most drakes, frequently clashing even with other members of their own kind. They rarely deign to talk with other creatures, often doing so only as a cruel game in which they make more and more outrageous demands until their victims realize the drakes are toying with them or the manipulative drakes grow bored. A rift drake rarely stays on land for long, preferring to circle high above near ominous peaks or spires and roosting in the crevices of the same. When a rift drake spies prey from such heights, it breaks from its flight to dive onto victims, scattering groups and sowing terror with its sudden emergence. With particularly agile foes, a rift drake will use its breath to slow victims first, then pick them off one by one. Rift drakes enjoy the taste of blood, and focus their attacks on the fleshiest-looking creatures. A rift drake is around 14 feet long, end to end. Its burly, spiky body weighs about 2,500 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Caustic Mucus (Su) As a standard action, a river drake can spit a ball of caustic mucus that explodes in a 5-foot-radius spread. This attack has a range of 50 feet, deals 2d8 points of acid damage, and entangles creatures in the area. A DC 14 Reflex save halves the damage and negates the entangle effect. An entangled creature takes 1d4 points of acid damage each round on its turn, and may attempt a new saving throw at the end of its turn every round to escape the entanglement and end the acid damage. Once a river drake spits mucus, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. Speed Surge (Ex) Three times per day as a swift action, a river drake can draw on its draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed that allows it to take an additional move action that round.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Preying upon fish and fishermen with equal ease, river drakes are scourges of freshwater expanses. They are thought to be related to black dragons, as evidenced by their acidic spit, water affinity, viciousness, and preference for rotten meat. Like other drakes, river drakes are cruel hunters, using a play-and-prey hunting style. When not hungry, they amuse themselves by stalking and harassing other creatures and travelers. An offering of treasure thrown into the water can distract a river drake, but such a bribe is unlikely to stave off a particularly hungry individual. River drakes often slay more than they can immediately eat because they favor aged meat, keeping underwater larders stuffed with kills in various stages of decay. A river drake is a crafty, careful hunter that uses its watery home to provide concealment from creatures on the shore. If caught unawares while on land, it retreats to the water, or takes to flight if its enemies are prepared for aquatic combat, making constant use of its caustic mucus and great speed. River drakes are much more likely to hunt in groups than most other drakes, threatening river traffic or assaulting lakefront or riverside towns if their numbers are large enough. However, these disorganized raids are quick to retreat from any hint of significant resistance. River drakes are 8 feet long and look much like small sea drakes. An adult river drake weighs about 700 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Malevolence (Su) Once per round, a dybbuk can merge itself with a creature on the Material Plane. This ability is similar to a magic jar spell (caster level 18th), except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, the dybbuk must be adjacent to the target. The target can resist the attack with a successful DC 26 Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same dybbuk's malevolence for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based. Pain Touch (Su) With a successful touch attack, a dybbuk causes painful spasms throughout the target's body, dealing 7d6 points of damage. Creatures that are immune to pain take no damage from this touch. Possess Object (Su) A dybbuk can use its malevolence ability to possess a Large or smaller unattended object, animating it as if using animate objects, except the dybbuk merges with and controls the object as if it were a living creature. The dybbuk cannot speak or use its other special abilities while possessing the object.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>A dybbuk is a misplaced soul who has eluded judgment because of a some great transgression or a pitiful suicide. Like a ghost, it lingers on in the mortal world, either trying to fulfill an insane need to right some great failure that has marked its soul for eternity or merely to spread the torment it is condemned to face for eternity. Bodiless and left to wander, dybbuks grow increasingly bitter and resentful over the loss of their bodies and endlessly seek mortal or even inanimate forms to steal and use to sow suffering. Vile manipulators, they seek bodies that have the greatest potential to cause pain in those closest to their victims, taking pleasure in shifting a leader's agenda toward the destruction of her followers or torturing an innocent from within. Dybbuks also often animate unliving things to spread fear, reveling in the chaos resulting from manipulating corpses to confuse and terrify. Most also realize they have all of eternity to torment their chosen victims, and might lurk quietly near a living target for weeks or months, waiting for the right moment to act and begin their terrors anew.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Seize Skin (Su) Whenever an ecorche damages a target with its rend ability, the target must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save to resist being skinned alive. Those who fail the save become staggered and take 1 point of Constitution drain per round. Both of these effects are permanent but can be removed with a regenerate or heal spell (or 1 round of regeneration). The ecorche can use its wear skin ability to don a skin stolen in this way as a full-round action. The save DC is Dexterity-based. Wear Skin (Su)An ecorche can steal the skin of a dead Small, Medium, or Large humanoid and wear it as its own. When it does this, the ecorche takes on the creature's size and appearance and gains a +10 bonus on Disguise checks made to impersonate the victim. While wearing a stolen skin, an ecorche cannot use its frightful presence. This stolen skin is preserved while the ecorche wears it, but is destroyed if the ecorche takes more than 10 points of damage or if the ecorche chooses to destroy the skin as a standard action. Those within 60 feet who see an ecorche's stolen skin destroyed are immediately subjected to its frightful presence and take a -5 penalty on the related Will save. An ecorche reverts to its normal size if its stolen skin is destroyed.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The bodyguards and spies of undead masterminds, ecorches appear as gory giants with musculatures overdeveloped by infusions of necromantic toxins and grafts of reanimated sinew. Although its natural form possesses no skin, an ecorche can steal the flesh of another creature, flaying its victim in mere seconds and leaving it in unimaginable shock and pain with only moments to seek aid before perishing. Yet this gruesome act of violence is only the first stage of the chaos an ecorche spreads with its violence. An ecorche possesses incredible control over its gruesome form, allowing it to compress its body into the skin of a much smaller creature. Wearing such grisly garb, these terrors walk among the living, doing the bidding of their terrible masters or searching for more inf luential individuals to murder, skin, and impersonate. If an ecorche's unholy nature is revealed, the monster is quick to dispose of its nowuseless disguise, bursting from the suit of flesh and exposing its terrible form to the unprepared, few of whom can withstand such unabashed gore. An ecorche stands approximately 8-1/2 feet tall and weighs upward of 600 pounds.</Description>

    <Description>An eidolon is usually tied to a summoner who forges an unbreakable link with a being not of his world, calling upon it and sending it back to its otherworldly home as he needs. When a summoner dies, this link is destroyed and the eidolon is banished back from whence it came. Occasionally, however, this link between eidolon and summoner is unnaturally severed, usually as a result of powerful magic or some bizarre death, freeing the eidolon upon the world. Few can predict what specific events might cause an eidolon to become unfettered, but those that do become stranded on a plane alien to them, released to act as they please. An eidolon that loses its link to its summoner loses its link to its home realm, and many unfettered eidolons go mad, the glowing runes that once represented their bonds burning painful scars onto their bodies. Unfettered eidolons are not quite as powerful as normal eidolons, but without their evolutions tied to their summoners' whims, these bizarre and varied creatures continue to evolve and advance on their own. CREATING AN UNFETTERED EIDOLON Unfettered eidolons can take on many shapes and sizes. The stats presented here are for a Medium unfettered eidolon with the serpentine base form and 15 evolution points, but an eidolon can take almost any form. An unfettered eidolon has one of four base forms: aquatic, biped, quadruped, or serpentine. Each base form determines an eidolon's speed, good and bad saves, and ability scores, and allots 5 evolution points to starting evolutions (the bonuses from these starting evolutions are already factored into the starting statistics). Each base form starts at Medium size. An unfettered eidolon can increase to Large size or larger by spending additional evolution points (see below). Aquatic Base Form: Speed 20 ft., swim 40 ft.; Saves Fort (good), Ref (good), Will (bad); Ability Scores Str 16, Dex 12, Con 13, Int 7, Wis 10, Cha 11; Starting Evolutions bite, gills, improved natural armor, swim (2). Biped Base Form: Speed 30 ft.; Saves Fort (good), Ref (bad), Will (good); Ability Scores Str 16, Dex 12, Con 13, Int 7, Wis 10, Cha 11; Starting Evolutions arms, claws, legs. Quadruped Base Form: Speed 40 ft.; Saves Fort (good), Ref (good), Will (bad); Ability Scores Str 14, Dex 14, Con 13, Int 7, Wis 10, Cha 11; Starting Evolutions bite, legs (2). Serpentine Base Form: Speed 20 ft., climb 20 ft.; Saves Fort (bad), Ref (good), Will (good); Ability Scores Str 12, Dex 16, Con 13, Int 7, Wis 10, Cha 11; Starting Evolutions bite, climb, reach (bite), tail, tail slap. An unfettered eidolon begins with 1 Hit Die, a +2 natural armor bonus, and the evasion ability. As an unfettered eidolon's Hit Dice increase (see Evolution Points, below), it gains additional bonuses and abilities. At 2 Hit Dice, and every 3 HD thereafter, an unfettered eidolon's base armor bonus increases by +2. This bonus may be split between an armor bonus and a natural armor bonus. Also at 2 Hit Dice, and every 3 HD thereafter, an unfettered eidolon adds +1 to both its Strength and Dexterity scores. At 5 Hit Dice, and every 4 HD thereafter, an unfettered eidolon adds +1 to any one of its ability scores. At 7 Hit Dice, an unfettered eidolon gains Multiattack as a bonus feat. Evolution Points Unfettered eidolons have a number of evolution points (EP) you can use to purchase abilities and defenses in addition to those presented above. An unfettered eidolon starts with 8 EP, regardless of its base form. For each additional EP spent beyond 8, an unfettered eidolon's Hit Dice increase by 1. An unfettered eidolon's CR increases with its Hit Dice, as outlined on Table 1-2 on page 291 of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary using the "outsider" line. Many of these abilities are universal monster rules detailed starting on page 292 of this book. Arms (Ex, 2 EP): Grows an additional pair of arms and hands. The eidolon must have the Weapon Training evolution in order to use weapons. Bite (Ex, 1 EP): Gains a bite attack (1d6 damage). Burrow (Ex, 3 EP): Gains a burrow speed equal to 1/2 its base speed. The eidolon must have at least 7 Hit Dice to select this evolution. Claw (Ex, 1 EP): Gains two claw attacks (1d4 damage). The eidolon must have arms or legs to take this evolution. Climb (Ex, 1 EP): Gains a climb speed equal to its base speed. For each additional EP spent on this evolution, this speed increases by 20 feet. Energy Attacks (Su, 2 EP): Choose one energy type (acid, cold, electricity, or fire). All of the eidolon's natural attacks deal +1d6 points of damage of this energy type. The eidolon must have at least 4 Hit Dice to select this evolution. Flight (Ex, 2 EP): Grows wings, gaining a fly speed equal to its base speed (good maneuverability). For each additional EP spent, the fly speed increases by 20 feet. The eidolon must have at least 4 Hit Dice to select this evolution. Gills (Ex, 1 EP): Can breathe underwater indefinitely in addition to air. Gore (Ex, 2 EP): Gains a gore attack (1d6 damage). Huge (Ex, 6 EP): Grows to Huge size (adjusting its Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, natural armor bonus, and size modifier to attacks and AC as detailed on page 296 of the Bestiary, and increasing the damage of all of its attacks as detailed on page 297 of this book). If the eidolon has the biped base form, its reach increases to 15 feet (10 feet for all other base forms). The eidolon must have the Large evolution and at least 10 Hit Dice to select this evolution. Improved Evasion (Ex, 3 EP): Gains improved evasion. Improved Natural Armor (Ex, 1 EP): Gains a +2 bonus to its natural armor. This evolution can be taken once if it has 3 or fewer Hit Dice, and one additional time for every 4 additional Hit Dice the eidolon has. Large (Ex, 4 EP): Grows to Large size (adjusting its Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, natural armor bonus, and size modifier to attacks and AC as detailed on page 296 of the Bestiary, and increasing the damage of all of its attacks as detailed on page 297 of this book). If the eidolon has the biped base form, it also gains 10-foot reach. The eidolon must have at least 6 Hit Dice to select this evolution. Legs (Ex, 2 EP): Grows an additional pair of legs. Each pair of legs increases the eidolon's base speed by 10 feet. Magical Flight (Su, 4 EP): Flies by means of magic, gaining a fly speed equal to its base speed (perfect maneuverability). this speed increases by 20 feet. The eidolon must have at least 4 Hit Dice before selecting this evolution. Reach (Ex, 1 EP): The reach of one of the eidolon's attacks increases by 5 feet. Resistance (Ex, 1 EP): Gains resistance 5 against one energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic). Slam (Ex, 1 EP): Gains a slam attack (1d8 damage). The eidolon must have arms to take this evolution. Sting (Ex, 1 EP): Gains a sting attack (1d4 damage). The eidolon must have a tail to take this evolution. Swim (Ex, 1 EP): Gains a swim speed equal to its base speed. For each additional EP spent, this speed increases by 20 feet. Tail (Ex, 1 EP): Grows a long, powerful tail, gaining a +2 racial bonus on Acrobatics checks made to balance on a surface. Tail Slap (Ex, 1 EP): Gains a tail slap attack (1d6 damage). The eidolon must have a tail to take this evolution. Weapon Training (Ex, 2 or 4 EP): Gains Simple Weapon Proficiency as a bonus feat. For 2 additional EP, it gains proficiency with all martial weapons as well. Small Eidolons The standard eidolon starts as Medium-sized, but Small eidolons are also possible. Compared to a Medium eidolon, a Small eidolon gains +2 to its Dexterity, -4 to its Strength, and -2 to its Constitution. It also gains a +1 size bonus to its AC and on attack rolls, a -1 size penalty on its CMB and to its CMD score, and a +4 size bonus on Stealth skill checks. If it can fly, it gains a +2 size bonus on Fly skill checks. Reduce the damage of all of its attacks by one step.</Description>

    <Description_Visual>This capricious figure has the upper torso, arms, and head of a man, but goatlike legs, a tail, and curling horns on his head.</Description_Visual>

    <SpecialAbilities>Panpipes (Su) Three times per day, a faun can use its masterwork panpipes to augment its spell-like abilities. Doing so is a swift action that increases the DC of the next spell-like ability it uses on its turn by +2.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Often mistaken for satyrs, fauns are far more benevolent than their unpredictable cousins. Many people use the two names interchangeably, a fact that irritates both fauns and satyrs. The vast majority of fauns are male, although unlike satyrs, females of this species do exist- they're simply less common than male fauns. While satyrs breeding with their seduced victims always produce full-blooded satyrs, fauns are the result of a willing pairing between satyrs and goodly fey or kindhearted humanoids such as humans or elves. Even in this case, the babies of such unions are usually stolen away and raised by their fey parent or some other sylvan foster family. Like satyrs, fauns enjoy wine, music, dancing, nature, and carnal pleasures. Gentle hedonists, fauns also have a dedicated connection to the countryside, helping hardworking humanoids who make peace with the land and take little more than they need. They help these frontier folk by fighting off significant threats and keeping less savory fey creatures away from their settlements. While they prefer to go unnoticed, in dire times a band of fauns may present themselves to villagers to warn their neighbors of an upcoming threat. Fauns find nymphs exceptionally attractive, more so than all others who dare view them. Nymphs find beauty in fauns' good nature and steadfast dedication to the natural world, and often humor their advances before almost accidentally falling in love with them. As tall as a human, a faun stands on stark white goat legs and has short horns protruding from its head. It also has a short tail that swishes playfully when it is excited or entertained, and its hair falls gracefully around its horns and ears. Its humanoid torso is always lithe but chiseled because of its constant activity and play-fauns rarely laze about too long. Fauns stand nearly 6 feet tall and weigh little more than 150 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Charging Trip (Ex) A festrog that hits with its bite after making a charge attack on all fours can attempt to trip its opponent (+4 bonus). This trip does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Diseased Pustules (Ex) When a festrog takes damage from a piercing or slashing weapon, some of its boils rupture, squirting the attacker with puslike fluids. The noxious secretions carry a potent contact disease that causes those infected to break out into painful necrotic boils. Necrotic Boils: Disease-contact; save Fort DC 11; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Con; cure 1 save. Feed (Su) Every time a festrog makes a successful bite attack, it feeds on its opponent's flesh and gains 5 temporary hit points. The festrog cannot have more than 5 temporary hit points gained by this ability at one time. Four-Footed Run (Ex) A festrog can run on all fours at speed of 50 feet if it doesn't hold or carry anything in its hands. When running on all fours, it is treated as if it had the Run feat.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>A festrog is an undead abomination spawned when a creature is killed by a massive release of negative energy (perhaps due to planar bleeding, the destruction of a potent artifact, or even certain magical attacks by powerful undead), and then mutilated by an outside force, such as the scavenging of wild animals. Sometimes called dog-ghouls for their ability to run on all fours, the name often causes opponents to misinterpret this creature's abilities and grossly underestimate its intelligence, for the festrog is in fact a rather canny monstrosity. Festrogs inhabit remote areas near places where they were slain. It's not uncommon for a tribe of festrogs to share territories with ghouls. Most festrogs gather in small bands, based on whatever loose affiliations they might recall from when they were alive, and choose dwellings in sunless areas easily defended with group tactics. Like ghouls, they tend to skulk about graveyards, though they prefer ones with tombs and mausoleums so they can hide during the day. They hunt nocturnally in packs, preferring open areas like plains, farmlands, or open forests where they can track down prey with few places for it to run or hide. These packs wander seminomadically, often traveling miles beyond their dwellings in pursuit of mortal flesh.</Description>

    <Description>Fey creatures resemble the mundane creatures they derive from, but with brighter colors, delicate features, and elegant wings such as those of a pixie or sprite. Despite their fragile-seeming appearance, fey creatures are every bit as hardy as their non-fey relations, though they sacrifice raw might for grace and the ability to fly. They live long lives, barring death by misadventure, and rarely show outward signs of age. Some fey creatures owe their nature to fey ancestors interbreeding with mortal beings, while others are races in their own right. Still others began life as ordinary creatures and were infused with fey essence through the magic of learned spellcasters or the inf luence of ancient powers of nature. As a rule, fey creatures rarely dwell in civilized lands, both by preference and because the conditions that give rise to the fey rarely occur in urban surroundings. If not already born into realms of primeval wild or areas touched by great fey powers, fey creatures soon seek them out. Though more prone to mischief than mayhem, fey creatures run the gamut from inimical to sprightly in behavior. Those inclined toward play and jest take a dim view of interlopers lacking in good humor. Such foul-tempered intruders risk humiliation at best if they insult the fey, and much worse if they raise arms against them. More aggressive fey still possess a well-developed though sadistic sense of humor. Such wicked fey use their inborn powers to lure outsiders to their doom, rather than into mere inconvenience. Fey creatures generally have cordial relationships with animals, allies of nature such as druids, and other fey. Exceptions exist where rival communities of fey dwell in proximity to one another. In these cases, any fey creatures in the vicinity ally with one side or the other according to their own inclinations, only rarely standing outside such conflicts. Fey creatures derived from horses and the like often serve as mounts, though only to other fey or to allies of nature who acknowledge them as at least near-equals, if not full partners. CREATING A FEY CREATURE "Fey Creature" is an inherited or acquired template that can be added to any living, corporeal creature. A fey creature retains the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here. CR: 9 HD or less, as base creature +1; 10 HD or more, as base creature +2. Alignment: Any non-lawful. Type: The creature's type changes to fey. Do not recalculate HD, BAB, or saves. Senses: A fey creature gains low-light vision. Armor Class: Reduce the creature's natural armor, if any, by 1 (minimum of 0). Defensive Abilities: A fey creature gains a +4 bonus on saves against mind-affecting effects, resist cold and electricity 10, and DR 5/cold iron (if 11 HD or less) or DR 10/ cold iron (if 12 HD or more). Speed: Unless the base creature flies better, the fey creature flies at 1-1/2 times the base creature's land speed (good maneuverability), rounded down to the nearest multiple of 5 feet. If the creature already has flight with a maneuverability of good, it increases to perfect. Special Abilities: A fey creature gains one of the following abilities for every 4 HD or fraction thereof. Camouflage (Ex) A fey creature can use Stealth to hide in any sort of natural terrain, even if the terrain does not grant cover or concealment. It gains a +4 racial bonus on Stealth checks. This bonus does not stack with any racial Stealth bonus possessed by the base creature. Change Shape (Su) A fey creature can change shape into a single form. Possible forms include a normal specimen of its base creature, a humanoid creature within one size category, or an animal within one size category. In all cases, the fey creature appears as the same individual of its alternate form each time it changes shape. The type of polymorph spell used should be chosen as appropriate based on the alternate form, such as alter self for taking humanoid form. This ability can be selected more than once, granting an additional form each time. Energy Resistance (Ex) A fey creature gains resistance 10 to one energy type, or increases an existing resistance by 10. Resistance increased beyond 30 becomes immunity instead. This ability can be selected more than once. Evasion (Ex) A fey creature gains evasion, as the rogue ability of the same name. Long Step (Su) A fey creature can teleport up to 10 feet per Hit Die as a move action. It may use this ability once every 1d4 rounds. Spell Resistance (Ex) A fey creature gains SR equal to 11 + its CR. This does not stack with any existing SR possessed by the base creature. Trackless Step (Ex) A fey creature does not leave a trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. It can choose to leave a trail, if it so desires. Vanish (Su) As a swift action, a fey creature can vanish for 1 round as if affected by invisibility. It can use this ability for 1 round per day per Hit Die. Woodland Stride (Ex) A fey creature can move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at its normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion still affect it. Optionally, this ability may function in a different type of terrain, to allow the fey creature to move through, swamps, rocky areas, ice, and so forth. Whatever the choice, this ability only functions in one type of terrain. This ability can be selected more than once, for a different terrain each time. Spell-Like Abilities: A fey creature with an Intelligence or Wisdom score of 8 or more has a cumulative number of spell-like abilities depending on its Hit Dice. Unless otherwise noted, an ability is usable once per day. Caster level equals the creature's HD (or the caster level of the base creature's spell-like abilities, whichever is higher). HD Abilities 1-2 Dancing lights 3/day, faerie fire 3-4 Entangle, glitterdust 5-6 Deep slumber 7-8 Major image 9-10 Confusion 11-12 Feeblemind 13-14 Mislead 15-16 Project image 17-18 Irresistible dance 19-20 Scintillating pattern Abilities: A fey creature gains a +4 bonus to Dexterity and a +2 bonus to Intelligence and Charisma. A fey creature receives a -2 penalty to Strength. Fey creatures derived from creatures without an Intelligence score gain an Intelligence of 3. Skills: A fey creature with racial Hit Dice has skill points per racial Hit Die equal to 6 + its Intelligence modifier. It gains Acrobatics, Bluff, Fly, and Stealth as class skills. Languages: Fey creatures speak Sylvan as well as any languages spoken by the base creature.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Mucus (Ex) As a free action, a flail snail can excrete a trail of mucus that covers its space and lasts for 10 minutes. This mucus comes in two types: slimy and sticky. A character who attempts to move through an area covered in slippery mucus must make a DC 14 Reflex save each round or fall prone. Sticky mucus transforms squares into difficult terrain. Only one type of mucus can be in effect at a time in any one square. Flail snails can move through either type of slime with ease. A square of mucus exposed to a fire source dries and reverts to normal. The save DC is Constitution-based. Retraction (Ex) A flail snail can pull its fleshy parts into its shell as a swift action, increasing its natural armor bonus by +6, but it cannot move or attack while retracted. It can return to normal as a free action. Slime Rope (Ex) A flail snail can turn its mucus into a ropelike strand up to 60 feet long, and can use this rope to hang itself and up to 1,000 extra pounds from the ceiling indefinitely, or to lower itself safely at a speed of 20 feet per round. It can climb back up this rope at a speed of 10 feet per round. Once the snail breaks contact with the rope, the slime decomposes in 1d4 rounds. While the slime rope exists, other creatures can climb the rope with a DC 20 Climb check. Suction (Ex) A flail snail's foot adheres to surfaces so well that its 10-foot climb speed applies even to perfectly sheer surfaces and ceilings, with no chance of the flail snail falling off unless it is actively pinned and peeled away as part of a grapple. Warp Magic (Su) Anytime a spell targets a flail snail, there is an 80% chance that it produces a random effect instead of affecting the snail. Only spells that directly target the flail snail are warped; area effect spells are not affected. If a spell is warped, roll 1d10 and consult the following table. 1-3 Spell misfires. For the next 1d4 rounds, the caster must make a DC 15 concentration check to successfully cast spells. 4-6 Spell misfires. The creature nearest the flail snail is affected as if the spell had been cast on it instead. 7-9 Spell fails. Nothing happens. 10 Spell rebounds on caster (as spell turning).</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Flail snails are intelligent gastropods that subsist on fungus, mold, and vermin, though they may attack larger creatures in self-defense. Known for their magic-warping shells and club-like tentacles, flail snails roam slowly through subterranean caverns writing great epics in their slime trails.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Acid Injection (Ex) When a flumph strikes an opponent with its spikes, it injects a burning, irritating acid that deals 1d4 points of acid damage immediately and another 1d4 points of acid damage on the round after the attack. The target can end the acid's effects by submerging the wound in water for a round or by being treated with a DC 15 Heal check. A creature that grapples or swallows the flumph takes this acid damage automatically every round it maintains this contact with a living flumph. Stench Spray (Ex) A flumph can spray a 20-foot line of foul-smelling liquid once every 1d4 rounds. This spray functions like the stench universal monster ability, except it only affects creatures struck by the spray, which must make a DC 10 Fortitude save or be sickened for 5 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. Alternatively, the flumph can concentrate the spray on a single target within 5 feet. To use this version of its stench spray, the flumph must succeed at a ranged touch attack (+5 for most flumphs). If the target is hit, it must make a DC 10 Fortitude save or become nauseated for 5 rounds; otherwise, it is sickened for 5 rounds. The odor from this spray lingers in the area and on all creatures struck for 1d4 hours, and can be detected at a range of 100 feet (creatures with the scent ability can smell it at double this range).</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Come from distant stars to protect unprepared worlds from cosmic horrors, flumphs are jellyfish-like creatures that float in the air and hunt with acidic spikes growing from their undersides. Gentle at heart, flumphs understand that their appearance often terrifies viewers, and thus conceal themselves and observe neighboring settlements from afar, only revealing themselves when absolutely necessary. They also know full well the limitations of their fragile forms, and rather than directly opposing the horrors they seek to defeat, they prefer to recruit and advise heroes to tackle these dangerous tasks instead. Flumphs float and speak via a constant flow of air through tiny pores in their white bodies, emitting a rhythmic puffing whenever they're aloft. Typical flumphs weigh 15 pounds and are 3 feet across. Flumphs deeply revere dreams, seeing them as omens and portents. While they normally mate and reproduce on the world of their birth, flumphs occasionally engage in a ritual called the Seeding, in which seed pods are flung into outer space in order to provide other planets with guardians.</Description>

    <Description>Foo creatures are benevolent guardian spirits that hail originally from the Outer Plane of Nirvana, where they spend their days cavorting in the idyllic wilds or aiding that realm's inhabitants, particularly the agathions, in their work. Yet while they come from Nirvana, foo creatures are often encountered on the Material Plane as well, for they are favorite conjurations of many cultures and religions. Countless species of foo creatures exist-for if an animal dwells upon the Material Plane, it is certain that somewhere in the vast wilds of Nirvana its spiritual double frolics and plays. Nonetheless, certain foo creatures are more common than others, and the most often encountered of all are dogs and lions. A foo creature can be called to the Material Plane for any reason a conjurer can imagine-these monsters are generally much more intelligent than their mundane counterparts, and can not only follow complex orders but can speak and converse as well. Typically, a foo creature is contacted to serve for a time as a guardian-by adopting its statue form using its freeze ability, a foo creature can appear as little more than an ornate decoration astride the facade of a building or standing guard over a fountain in a city plaza. They are not as often called upon to serve as soldiers in armies, for foo creatures detest war. They generally dislike serving as mounts as well, although for particularly pious and kindly folk, they have been known to make exceptions. CREATING A FOO CREATURE "Foo Creature" is an inherited template that can be added to any animal, referred to hereafter as the base creature. A foo creature retains all the base creature's statistics and abilities except as noted here. Challenge Rating: Same as the base creature +1. Alignment: Any good. Type: The base creature's type changes to outsider with the good subtype. It gains the augmented subtype. Do not recalculate BAB, saves, or skill ranks. Senses: As the base creature, plus darkvision 60 feet. AC: A foo creature's natural armor bonus increases by +2. Hit Dice: The base creature's racial Hit Dice change to d10s. Defensive Abilities: A foo creature retains all of the base creature's defensive abilities and special qualities. It also gains the following. Damage Reduction (Ex): A foo creature gains DR/ bludgeoning based on its Hit Dice. A foo creature with up to 10 HD gains DR 5/bludgeoning. A foo creature with 11 or more HD gains DR 10/bludgeoning. Paired Protectors (Su): When two or more foo creatures are within 30 feet of one another, they both gain the benefit of a protection from evil spell. The caster level of this protection from evil effect is equal to the highest Hit Dice of the affected foo creatures. This effect can be dispelled, but if it is, a foo creature can reactivate it as a swift action. Stony Defense (Su): A number of times per day equal to its Hit Dice, a foo creature can harden its skin to unyielding stone as an immediate action. It gains hardness 8 until the end of its next turn, but its speed is reduced by 10 feet for the same duration. Special Abilities: A foo creature retains all of the base creature's special attacks and special abilities. It also gains the following special quality. Freeze (Ex): A foo creature can hold itself so still it appears to be a statue. A foo creature that uses freeze can take 10 on its Stealth check to hide in plain sight as a stone statue. A foo creature can maintain this position for as long as it wishes. Abilities: +2 Strength, +2 Constitution, +4 Intelligence. Feats: All foo creatures gain Iron Will as a bonus feat. Languages: All foo creatures speak Common and Celestial. CREATING AN IMPERIAL FOO CREATURE Among foo creatures there exist what are known as the "imperials"-the leaders of particular races of foo creatures. Imperial foo creatures are much more powerful than the typical examples of their kind, and possess a wide array of additional magical powers. Each imperial foo creature is a unique entity; only one exists at any one time. When an imperial foo creature is slain, the next most powerful foo creature of its species immediately transcends to this role to replace the one that was lost. To create an imperial foo creature, first generate the statistics for a regular foo creature. The steps you'll go through to create the imperial version of that foo creature are more akin to those you'd go through to advance a creature by Hit Dice rather than a standard template. Step One-Increase Ability Scores: Upon becoming an imperial, the foo creature gains a +6 bonus to all of its ability scores, save for Intelligence, which increases to 20 (unless the +6 increase would normally increase its Intelligence to an even higher score, in which case use that score instead). Step Two-Advance Hit Dice: An imperial foo creature always has at least double the original foo creature's Hit Dice-you can give the imperial foo creature even more Hit Dice than this if you want to make a particularly powerful one. Base attack bonus, saves, skill ranks, feats, and all other variables dependant upon Hit Dice change as normal. Step Three-Increase Size: Increase the foo creature's size by one category, applying the modifiers for size changes as summarized on Table 2-2 on page 296 of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary. Step Four-Spellcasting: An imperial foo creature casts spells as a 10th-level sorcerer, and can cast spells from the cleric list as well as those normally available to a sorcerer. Cleric spells are considered arcane spells for an imperial foo creature. The imperial foo creature gains Eschew Materials as a bonus feat, but gains no other class ability normally granted by the sorcerer class. Step Five-Determine CR: Compare the foo creature's statistics to those presented on Table 1-1 on page 291 of the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary to determine the creature's final CR. An imperial foo creature has a minimum CR score of 11. If your creation's statistics aren't good enough to qualify for this CR minimum, continue adding racial Hit Dice until the imperial's statistics reach this minimum.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Acid (Ex) A garden ooze excretes digestive acid that can dissolve flesh. Creatures made of harder materials or plant matter are immune to the ooze's acid. Camouflage (Ex) A garden ooze is difficult to spot when it is at rest among plant growth of any type. A DC 15 Perception check is required to notice the ooze is a separate entity and not a diseased portion of the plant it rests upon. The ooze automatically hits with a slam against any creature that fails to notice the ooze and enters its square. Stink (Ex) Once every 24 hours, a garden ooze can release foul-smelling gases in a 5-foot-radius spread centered on the ooze. The ooze usually does so after it is first injured. The stench of these vapors is overpowering during the first round it exists, causing living creatures within it to become sickened for 1d3 rounds (Fort DC 13 negates). This is a poison effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>A garden ooze is an animate, acidic mass of protoplasmic goo that dwells among foliage and scavenges proteins in the form of carrion or small animals that blunder into its vicinity. Although garden oozes are occasionally found in underground regions near the surface-such as sewers, sinkholes, and shallow caves-these oozes prefer the outdoors. One reason for this is that garden oozes are attracted to large collections of organic material where other tiny creatures might come to scavenge. Quick and cunning hunters when compared to most oozes, garden oozes are particularly dangerous because they readily attack creatures that wander nearby regardless of the creatures' size. Oozes that sense prey moving closer are likely to wait to attack until the potential meal is within reach. The oozes also give chase when prey flees. Garden oozes innately change hue to match the ground underneath them, so they can be hard to spot. When a garden ooze attacks, it lashes out with a whiplike appendage coated with a potent flesh-eating acid. If injured, the ooze releases a disgusting stench that makes it harder to fight off. Further, when one garden ooze attacks, any other garden oozes nearby join in, piling on and making escape all but impossible. Fortunately for larger potential prey, most garden oozes are quite small, the largest among them reaching 3 feet in diameter before they split into smaller oozes. These oozes are also known as rat-catcher oozes or compost oozes, and some brave gardeners actually encourage the growth of such oozes in their gardens as a way to combat pests. Once the pests are under control, however, the oozes themselves must be hunted and slain before the garden is safe to tend.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Bloodsense (Su) A ghorazagh notices living creatures within 60 feet just as if it possessed the blindsight ability. Bloodspray (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds, a ghorazagh can unleash a 20-foot cone of blood and eldritch enzymes. Any living creature struck by a ghorazagh's bloodspray must make a DC 25 Fortitude save or be affected as by the spell slow. A slowed creature struck by a ghorazagh's bloodspray a second time must make an additional save or be paralyzed. These effects last for 2d6 rounds. A ghorazagh can also consciously alter its enzymes, producing a spray that removes all effects of this ability. The save DC is Constitution-based. Chemical Communication (Ex) Ghorazaghs can communicate with other ghorazaghs within 60 feet via pheromone transmission. In a ghorazagh hive, this range extends to cover the entire hive. This is a silent and instantaneous mode of communication that only ghorazaghs can understand.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Ghorazaghs-or gore weavers-f loat like tumorous specters through the deepest, most alien cavities of the lightless underground, preying upon the wretched vermin of those horrid places. Cunning, with minds and drives unknowable and obscene to those of lands above, the gore weavers only recently became aware of the fertility and bounty of the surface world and are now slowly turning their ebon eyes upward. While ghorazaghs can digest nearly anything, they are incapable of digesting blood. Their digestive systems process flesh, bone, and all other organic material, filtering out blood and storing it in large reservoirs within their bodies, whereupon the blood is mixed internally with mucus and other strange fluids to form a thick, gluelike substance. While a ghorazagh can spray this fluid as an attack to impede prey, the primary use of the foul substance is as a building material. Ghorazagh hives are constructed entirely of this material, which when it dries has the strength of metal while retaining a dark red resinlike appearance. A ghorazagh hive is a nightmare place as a result-twisting tunnels with an eerily organic appearance that can wind for miles on end.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Cursed Claws (Ex) A ghul's claws count as both cold iron and magic for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. Genie-kin (Ex) For all race-related effects (such as a ranger's favored enemy), a ghul is considered a genie even though its type is undead.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Ghuls are undead jann whose eternal existence was twisted by fate and wrought through the displeasure of Ahriman, Lord of the Divs. As if the curse of undeath and ravenous hunger were not enough, these once-majestic creatures now bear donkey hooves as feet. Despite their horrific undead appearance, this feature shames them the most, and they hide their feet from view. Ghuls, like ghouls and ghasts, haunt cemeteries and other places of the dead hoping to feed on corpses. They also hunt mourners and grave tenders, as they enjoy the taste of living prey as well as that of the dead. Selective in their diets, ghuls choose their victims by personality, believing innocence and youth taste more delicious than the barely palatable flesh of the bitter and old. Sometimes a ghul follows a funeral procession in hyena form, keeping a safe distance until the ceremony, whereupon it changes into its true form to attack and feast. Sorrow and despair taste as delicious as innocence to a ghul. While not directly affected by sunlight, ghuls despise its presence and only move about during the day if forced to by necessity. They primarily hunt at night, sometimes straying far from their graveyard lairs and burial caves in search of fresh prey to sate their hunger. The longer a ghul goes without feeding, the more ferocious and primal the creature becomes. A well-sated ghul organizes with others of its kind and lesser undead, tormenting nearby towns and settlements. A ghul involved with this level of organization often has a scattered set of lairs throughout the desert. These allow the ghul to strike far from its home lair and hide again without having to travel during the blistering daylight sun. When a ghul goes for too long without feeding, it becomes increasingly feral and violent- its statistics don't change, but it grows less concerned with fleeing combat, even when it is obviously outmatched. Ghuls stand 6 feet tall and weigh 90 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Disease (Su) While ash giants are immune to disease, they carry a contagious form of leprosy. Any creature struck by an ash giant's attacks is exposed to this virulent sickness. Ash Leprosy: Injury; save Fort 23; onset 1 minute; frequency 1 day; effect 1d2 Con damage, 1d2 Cha drain; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based. Oversized Weapon (Ex) An ash giant can wield Huge weapons without penalty. Vermin Empathy (Ex) This ability functions as a druid's wild empathy ability, save that it works only on vermin. An ash giant gains a racial bonus on this check equal to its Hit Dice (+14 for most ash giants). Vermin are normally mindless, but this empathic communication imparts upon them a modicum of implanted intelligence, allowing the ash giant to train vermin and use them as guardians (although it does not grant them skills or feats).</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Whether because of disruptive magic, unearthed deep elements, or alien technology that fell calamitously from the sky, ash giants are victims of their barren terrains. Yet they somehow survive and even thrive in these desperate lands. Ash giants have an uncanny ability to bond with the enormous and often mutated vermin they share the landscape with, and sometimes use the largest of these creatures as mounts. Ash giants are brash and violent, and their humor is incredibly dark. Killing someone through a prank is just as funny as tripping a friend while on a hunt. While not inherently evil, lifetimes of being antagonized by other tribes have practically bred violence into their minds. Ash giants are 10 feet tall and weigh 1,200 pounds.</Description>

    <Description>Stooped over in a perpetual crouch, cave giants move as if they had never mastered walking erect. Their faces mix the worst features of ogre and feral orc. The largest would measure 10 feet in height if they ever stood straight. The typical cave giant weighs 1,000 pounds. Though few survive past 60 years, cave giants can live as long as 150 years. While they prove remarkably adept with axes of all varieties, cave giants lack the patience to work metal. What metal a cave giant possesses was likely stolen from other giants or worked by enslaved subterranean smiths. Slaves such as dwarves, orcs, and troglodytes do most of the labor in cave giant settlements. Poor treatment and the need for meat keep slave populations small and ever-rotating. New slaves are brought in whenever raiding parties remember to reign in their blood lust. Any prisoners who fail to submit to their new masters find themselves served on the dinner table or tossed screaming into the giant's cave lizard pens. Giant lizards of all types serve as both guard beasts and sport for the cave giants. Giant frilled lizards are rarely pets, as most cave giants opt to keep less dangerous monitor lizards instead. Kept in check only by fear and brutal beatings, such pets turn on their handlers at the first sign of weakness. At feeding time, live captives are tossed into the pens, a festive event filled with boisterous cheers and spirited betting.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Sandwalking (Ex) A desert giant travels at full speed across sand, rocky ground, or dust, and leaves no trail behind unless it chooses to. Scimitar Training (Ex) All desert giants are proficient with scimitars, and can wield them as if they were light weapons. A desert giant adds its full Strength bonus to attacks made with a scimitar wielded in its off hand, and gains a +4 bonus to CMD versus disarm and sunder attempts when fighting with a scimitar in each hand.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Desert giants rove the stark and majestic sands, rarely dwelling in permanent camps. They roam from oasis to oasis, sleeping beneath the stars or in easily dismantled yurts, breaking camp as whim strikes or when food sources grow scarce. Desert giants stand 15 feet tall on average, but have slender builds and rarely weigh more than 2,000 pounds, a fact that greatly contributes to their grace and speed. The giants favor loose robes with keffiyehs for protection from the scouring desert winds, as well as traveling leathers worn beneath the robes. They require little water, and are able to survive for as long as 2 weeks on food alone. When such goods are available, they drink water, milk, and juices in prodigious amounts, but they spurn beer, wine, and stronger spirits. The bulk of their diet comes from figs, olives, and similar bounty of the oases, supplemented by meat if required. The eldest desert giants live as long as 300 years. Despite their nomadic ways, desert giants guard their territory fiercely, driving away all interlopers, whether intelligent or bestial.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Archery Expert (Su) A jungle giant is proficient with all bows, and does not provoke an attack of opportunity when firing a bow in melee combat. Spell Storing (Su) Once per day as a immediate action, a jungle giant can absorb a targeted or ranged touch spell used against it, negating the effects against it but not against any other targets. It can retain this stored power for up to 1 minute, during which time its tattoos glow with blue fire. If it damages a target with a successful hit using a melee or ranged weapon, it can cast the spell on the target as a free action, as if it were using a spell storing weapon. This spell uses the caster level and DC of the original caster. This discharges the stored spell. Warding Tattoos (Su) A jungle giant's magical tattoos grant it a +4 deflection bonus to Armor Class. The giant loses this bonus if it wears armor.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Reclusive by nature, jungle giants lair deep within the rainforest. These giants distrust the ways of civilization and resent trespassers. More than one vine-covered lost city in the deep jungle owes its fall to jungle giant ire. The warrior-women of these tribes usually fight with bows, sacred weapons often passed down over generations from mother to daughter. To touch a jungle giant's bow without permission is a mortal insult. Jungle giants stand 17 feet tall and weigh 4,000 pounds. Their barklike skin bears runic brands etched into each giant as a rite of passage into adulthood. Jungle giant tribes are matriarchal, ruled by an elder female warrior. Males traditionally defend the village, gather food, tend livestock, and raise children.</Description>

    <Description>Girtablilus fiercely guard ancient places and treasures lost to history. Far from civilized eyes, they thrive and piously protect their charges with the aid of monstrously large scorpions that girtablilus keep as pets. All girtablilus share a zeal for religion, although the objects of veneration vary from tribe to tribe. Some girtablilu tribes still serve long-forgotten deities, preserving the divinities' names and holy rituals. Others embrace religions derived from prehistoric worship, devoted to the idea of gods that once were or might never have been. Girtablilu leaders are clerics or oracles, and are responsible for the tribe's religious observances and laws. Tradition and service to the group are important. Those who violate tribal beliefs are killed or exiled into the harsh wasteland. Girtablilus believe that no sacrifice in life (including death in the service of the gods) goes unrewarded in the hereafter; this belief makes them fierce and fearless fighters. A girtablilu is 13 feet long and weighs 800 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Create Spawn (Ex) When a globster eats a living creature, it only digests a small portion of the remains. As the undigested remains accumulate inside of it, the globster grows more and more bloated. As a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, a globster can regurgitate these foul remains along with portions of its own mass. Doing so causes the globster 1d6 points of damage, but creates a new, fully grown globster that immediately attacks the nearest non-globster target. A globster can create spawn up to once per day, though only after it has fed upon at least four Medium-sized creatures (or the equivalent number of creatures of other sizes). Decompose (Ex) A slain globster decays into a mass of goo in the span of 24 hours. However, the corpse retains the creature's stench aura for 1d10 days after its death. Nausea (Ex) Any creature struck by a globster must make a DC 18 Fortitude save to avoid being nauseated for 1 round. Once a creature makes this saving throw, it is immune to further nausea effects from that particular globster for 24 hours. This is a poison effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>A globster is a living collection of half-digested parts from large sea creatures such as whales and squid. Passersby usually discover it by smell long before they see it. Many unfortunate folk who happen upon a globster mistake it for the carcass of a beached sea animal, getting too close before discovering the seemingly dead creature is very much alive. For a time, sages believed globsters were undead-that they were simply undulating wads of rotting flesh animated with a drive to feed. However, globsters are actually living creatures. Globsters usually wash up on a beach or float to the shore to feed on terrestrial stock for a few hours before returning to the safety of water. Some say the tides and phases of the moon are to blame for the times globsters come to land to feed. Globsters reproduce by mixing parts of their own foul bodies with the poorly digested remains of their meals.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Goblin Breath (Ex) Once every 1d4 rounds, a goblin snake can release a disgusting belch as a standard action. Any creature within 5 feet of the goblin snake must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d6 rounds by the stench. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same goblin snake's goblin breath for 24 hours. Goblin snakes and goblins are immune to this effect. This is a poison effect. The save DC is Constitution-based. Snake Empathy (Ex) This ability functions similarly to a druid's wild empathy ability, but allows a goblin snake to verbally communicate with and be understood by snakes and similar serpentine reptiles. The bonus equals the goblin snake's racial Hit Dice plus its Charisma modifier and a +4 racial bonus.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Tenacious predators and bullies, goblin snakes are shrill, impulsive, and endlessly hungry. When their instinctual cunning takes hold, however, these maniacal creatures exhibit all the stealth and deadly cunning of serpents coupled with the capricious destructiveness of goblins. Cruel and selfish, goblin snakes care for little more than their next meals and indulging their unfounded arrogance. Like goblins, they can easily eat their body weight in food daily, but goblin snakes are also lazy, and are more likely to settle for easy meals rather than ones they must work to find. As a result, goblins snakes eat almost anything within reach and readily available, from carrion to rubbish (the source of their horrendous and nauseating breath). Goblin snakes delight in fresh meat, but strongly prefer having others bring it to them over hunting and killing it themselves. Enjoying the company of snakes, goblin snakes are often accompanied by several smaller venomous serpents, which the goblin snakes use to protect their lairs and supplement their food supply. Goblin snakes are exceedingly jealous of nagas, however, envying their serpentine majesty and mastery of magic. Enterprising and cunning goblin snakes have been known to impersonate nagas, demanding tribute and food from gullible creatures in awe of the "naga's" supposed magical abilities. Some scholars have noted the superficial similarities between goblin snakes and nagas, and have gone as far as to theorize that the goblin snake might be a particularly weak breed of naga-a theory that most nagas do not appreciate at all. Although goblin snakes are not as smart as goblins, their terrifying shape allows them to take positions of inf lated prominence within goblin society. Fearful goblins typically defer to the beasts, which well suits the goblin snakes' innate arrogance and sense of superiority. Goblin snakes affiliated with goblin tribes usually treat their goblin associates as servants at best and slaves at worst. Goblin snakes share goblins' fear of horses (who could easily step on and crush an unwary goblin snake) and love of fire (though their lack of arms gives them little opportunity to indulge in arson), but they are not as superstitious as goblins. Goblin snakes eagerly embrace magic if given the opportunity, and it is not uncommon for a goblin snake with adept, cleric, oracle, or sorcerer class levels to serve as a goblin tribe's shaman or high priest.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Bone Prison (Ex) As a standard action, a bone golem can throw some of its bones at a creature within 30 feet-it must make a ranged touch attack to hit. These bones magically duplicate and form a cage surrounding struck creatures. Each round, the cage makes a combat maneuver check to deal the golem's slam damage, using the golem's CMB. If the check fails, the target is still trapped but takes no damage. The target can escape the grapple normally, or can break out of the bones by dealing 15 points of damage to the prison, which has the same AC, DR, and saves as the bone golem itself. Damage to the prison has no effect on the golem. The golem can only have one bone prison active at a time. If it wishes to create a second one, it (or some other creature) must first destroy the existing one. Immunity to Magic (Ex) A bone golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and abilities function differently against the creature, as noted below. Magical effects that heal living creatures slow a bone golem (as the slow spell) for 1d4 rounds (no save). • A magical attack that deals negative energy damage breaks any slow effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A bone golem gets no saving throw against attacks that deal negative energy damage. • A raise dead, resurrection, or true resurrection spell negates its DR and immunity to magic for 1 minute.</SpecialAbilities>

Breath Weapon (Su) As a free action once every 1d4 rounds, a brass golem can expel a cloud of smoke and cinders that fills a 20-foot cube. This functions as an incendiary cloud that persists for 1d6 rounds, dealing 6d6 points of fire damage (DC 20 Reflex for half). The save DC is Constitution-based. Death Throes (Ex) A brass golem explodes when it is destroyed. All creatures within 30 feet of the golem take 12d8 points of fire damage (DC 20 Reflex for half). The save DC is Constitution-based. Immunity to Magic (Ex) A brass golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature. • A magical attack that deals cold damage slows a brass golem (as per the slow spell) for 1d6 rounds, with no saving throw. • A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A brass golem gets no save against fire effects.</SpecialAbilities>

    <SpecialAbilities>Alloyed (Ex) A cannon golem's slam and cannon attacks count as adamantine, cold iron, and silver for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Blasting Critical (Ex) When a cannon golem confirms a critical hit with a slam attack, it can make one cannon attack against that target as a free action (as long as the cannon is loaded). Cannon (Ex) The golem's cannon has a range increment of 100 feet and deals 6d6 points of bludgeoning and piercing damage on a hit with a x4 critical modifier. The cannon's magazine can hold up to 20 cannonballs at a time-reloading a single cannonball into this magazine is a standard action for the golem, while loading a cannonball into the cannon itself to fire it is a swift action; this allows the golem to take two shots per round with the cannon. Gun Training (Ex) A cannon golem adds its Dex modifier to the damage dealt by its cannon. Immunity to Magic (Ex) A cannon golem is immune to spells and spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance. Certain spells and effects function differently against it, as noted below. • Any spell with the water descriptor that affects a cannon golem renders its cannon unusable for 1 round (no save). • A heat metal spell causes the golem's cannon to instantly backfire, dealing 6d6 points of damage to the golem and staggering it for 1 round (no save).</SpecialAbilities>

    <SpecialAbilities>Immunity to Magic (Su) A fossil golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and abilities function differently against the creature, as noted below. • A transmute rock to mud spell slows a fossil golem (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw. • A stone to flesh spell negates its damage reduction and petrification ability for 1 round. Petrification (Su) The attacks of a fossil golem gradually turn living flesh to stone. Each time the golem hits a target with one of its natural attacks, the target must make a DC 19 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Dexterity drain. A creature that is reduced to 0 Dexterity by this attack turns completely to stone, as if by a flesh to stone spell. Casting stone to flesh on the creature removes all Dexterity drain caused by this attack. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>A fossil golem is constructed of the stony bones of long-dead dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures. These bones are generally not assembled with any attempt to accurately model the original creature-usually, the skulls of powerful predatory dinosaurs (such as tyrannosauruses) serve in the place of hands, granting the fossil golem a pair of devastating bite attacks. The magical energies that infuse a fossil golem create an additional peril-they transform fossilization into a terrible form of contagion that can affect any creature they damage. Fossil golems are often used to guard caverns and other natural fortifications. A fossil golem at rest might look to the untrained eye like nothing more than a strange display of bones. A fossil golem is 20 feet tall and weighs 8,000 pounds. CONSTRUCTION A fossil golem must be constructed from the fossilized skeletons of at least two creatures of Huge size or greater. The fossilized bone making up the golem requires extensive preservation and reassembly with alchemical solutions at a cost of 5,000 gp.

    <SpecialAbilities>Breath Weapon (Su) Each of a gorynych's heads has its own separate breath weapon. When a gorynych uses its breath weapon, it can breathe with one, two, or all three heads. If the areas of two or more breath weapons overlap, a creature caught in that overlapping area takes a -2 penalty on its Reflex save (or -4 if three breath weapons overlap). Damage done by overlapping breath weapons stacks and is considered to be a single source of fire damage for the purpose of tracking fire resistance. Regardless of how many heads breathe fire, the gorynych can only use its breath weapon once every 1d4 rounds. Multi-Headed (Ex) All three of a gorynych's heads can act independently of each other. When it makes a full attack, each head can either bite or use its breath weapon, in any combination (two bites and one breath, three breaths and no bites, and so on).</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>This sinister beast threatens entire countrysides with its plundering actions. No friend to its true dragon cousins, a gorynych sometimes threatens green and black dragons for mastery of their lands. A gorynych seeks out young dragons that have only established small hoards, killing the rival creatures and claiming their treasures as its own. It dominates drakes and wyverns, but true dragons consider it a repulsive throwback to an ancient line of mutants and deviants. Motivated by greed, gluttony, and unnatural lust, a gorynych lives to collect treasure, feast as often as possible, and chase after humanoid maidens, using alter self and charm person as necessary. Gorynyches are particularly creative with the use of their limited wishes in duplicating other spell effects to secure their desires and complete their hideous tasks. When not busily stalking young dragons in order to steal their hoard or selecting maidens to kidnap, most gorynyches search out ancient ruins. There they install themselves as guardians, sometimes even gathering whole tribes of monstrous humanoids to act as their servants</Description>

    <Description>Undying tyrants and eternal champions of the undead, graveknights arise from the corpses of the most nefarious warlords and disgraced heroes-villains too merciless to submit to the shackles of death. They bear the same weapons and regalia they did in life, though warped or empowered by their profane resurrection. The legions they once held also flock to them in death, ready to serve their wicked ambitions once more. A graveknight's essence is fundamentally tied to its armor, the bloodstained trappings of its battle lust. This armor becomes an icon of its perverse natures, transforming into a monstrous second skin over the husk of desiccated flesh and scarred bone locked within. CREATING A GRAVEKNIGHT "Graveknight" is an acquired template that can be added to any living creature with 5 or more Hit Dice (referred to hereafter as the base creature). Most graveknights were once humanoids. A graveknight uses the base creature's statistics and abilities except as noted here. CR: Same as base creature +2. Alignment: Any evil. Type: The graveknight's type changes to undead (augmented). Do not recalculate class Hit Dice, BAB, or saves. Senses: A graveknight gains darkvision 60 ft. Aura: A graveknight emanates the following aura. Sacrilegious Aura (Su): A graveknight constantly exudes an aura of intense evil and negative energy in a 30-foot radius. This aura functions as the spell desecrate and uses the graveknight's armor as an altar of sorts to double the effects granted. The graveknight constantly gains the benefits of this effect (including the bonus hit points, as this aura is part of the graveknight's creation). In addition, this miasma of fell energies hinders the channeling of positive energy. Any creature that attempts to summon positive energy in this area-such as through a cleric's channel energy ability, a paladin's lay on hands, or any spell with the healing subtype-must make a concentration check with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the graveknight's Hit Dice + the graveknight's Charisma modifier. If the character fails, the effect is expended but does not function. Armor Class: Natural armor improves by +4. Hit Dice: Change all racial Hit Dice to d8s. Class Hit Dice are unaffected. As an undead, a graveknight uses its Charisma modifier to determine bonus hit points. Defensive Abilities: A graveknight gains channel resistance +4; DR 10/magic; and immunity to cold, electricity, and any additional energy type noted by its ruinous revivification special quality. A graveknight also gains spell resistance equal to its augmented CR + 11. The graveknight also gains the following ability. Rejuvenation (Su): One day after a graveknight is destroyed, its armor begins to rebuild the undead horror's body. This process takes 1d10 days-if the body is destroyed before that time passes, the armor merely starts the process anew. After this time has elapsed, the graveknight wakens fully healed. Attacks: A graveknight gains a slam attack if the base creature didn't have one. Damage for the slam depends on the graveknight's size (see Bestiary 302). Special Attacks: A graveknight gains the following special attacks. Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 the graveknight's HD + the graveknight's Charisma modifier unless otherwise noted. Channel Destruction (Su): Any weapon a graveknight wields seethes with energy, and deals an additional 1d6 points of damage for every 4 Hit Dice the graveknight has. This additional damage is of the energy type determined by the ruinous revivification special quality. Devastating Blast (Su): Three times per day, the graveknight may unleash a 30-foot cone of energy as a standard action. This blast deals 2d6 points of damage for every 3 Hit Dice a graveknight has (Reflex for half ). This damage is of the energy type determined by the graveknight's ruinous revivification special quality. Undead Mastery (Su): As a standard action, a graveknight can attempt to bend any undead creature within 50 feet to its will. The targeted undead must succeed at a Will save or fall under the graveknight's control. This control is permanent for unintelligent undead; an undead with an Intelligence score is allowed an additional save every day to break free from the graveknight's control. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same graveknight's undead mastery for 24 hours. A graveknight can control 5 Hit Dice of undead creatures for every Hit Die it has. If the graveknight exceeds this number, the excess from earlier uses of the ability becomes uncontrolled, as per animate dead. Special Qualities: A graveknight gains the following. Phantom Mount (Su): Once per hour, a graveknight can summon a skeletal horse similar to a phantom steed. This mount is more real than a typical phantom steed, and can carry one additional rider. The mount's powers are based on the graveknight's total Hit Dice rather than caster level. A graveknight's mount looks distinctive and always appears the same each time it is summoned. If the mount is destroyed, it can be summoned again with full hit points 1 hour later. Ruinous Revivification (Su): At the time of its creation, the graveknight chooses one of the following energy types: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. This energy type should be relevant to the graveknight's life or death, defaulting to fire if none are especially appropriate. This energy type inf luences the effects of several of a graveknight's special abilities. Ability Scores: Str +6, Int +2, Wis +4, Cha +4. As an undead creature, a graveknight has no Constitution score. Skills: Graveknights gain a +8 racial bonus on Intimidate, Perception, and Ride checks. Feats: Graveknights gain Improved Initiative, Mounted Combat, Ride-By Attack, and Toughness as bonus feats. GRAVEKNIGHT ARMOR In death, the graveknight's life force lingers on in its armor, not its corpse, in much the same way that a lich's essence is bound within a phylactery. Unless every part of a graveknight's armor is ruined along with its body, a graveknight can rejuvenate after it is destroyed. A typical suit of full plate graveknight armor has hardness 10 and 45 hit points, though armor with enhancements or made of special materials proves more difficult to destroy. Merely breaking a graveknight's armor does not destroy it; it must be ruined, such as by being disintegrated, taken to the Positive Energy Plane, or thrown into the heart of a volcano.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Faith Bound (Su) A graven guardian cannot attack any creature that openly wears or displays the holy or unholy symbol of the deity to which the graven guardian is dedicated unless that creature first attacks the graven guardian. Magic Weapon (Su) A graven guardian that carries its deity's favored weapon treats that weapon as a +1 weapon as long as it is wielded by the guardian. If the weapon is a melee weapon, it gains the keen weapon special ability (even if the weapon is a bludgeoning weapon). If it is a thrown weapon, it gains the returning weapon special ability. If it is a ranged weapon, it gains the seeking weapon special ability, and generates new ammunition with each attack (this ammunition is destroyed whether or not it hits).</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Graven guardians are human-sized constructs of clay, stone, wood, or similar materials, crafted and painted to resemble a deity or a deity's favored servants. When not in motion, a graven guardian appears identical to a temple or crypt's statue, but while active, graven guardians look extremely lifelike. Graven guardians are inexorably tied to a specific deity's faith. While unintelligent and thus lacking any real personality, a graven guardian has the ability to recognize fellow worshipers or minions of its deity and does not treat them as enemies unless they first attack. This recognition does not extend so far as to allow these worshipers (or those cunningly disguised as worshipers) to give a graven guardian new orders. As with all constructs, a graven guardian follows only the orders of its creator. GUARDIAN DOMAINS Each graven guardian gains a special ability from two domains assigned during construction. Save DCs for these abilities are Wisdom-based (DC 14 for most guardians). Caster level for these abilities is equal to the graven guardian's Hit Dice (CL 5th for most graven guardians). Air: Flight (Su)-The graven guardian gains a fly speed equal to its base speed with average maneuverability and a Fly skill of +6 (this includes a +4 racial bonus). Animal: Beast Ward (Su)-Animals must make a Will save before they can attack the graven guardian. Any attack on an animal (but not its allies) by the graven guardian breaks this protection. Once the animal makes this Will save, it need not save again against that particular graven guardian on subsequent attacks. Artifice: Repair (Ex)-The graven guardian's fast healing increases to 5. Chaos: Chaotic Weapons (Su)-The graven guardian's weapon and slam attacks are treated as chaotic-aligned. Its magic weapon deals +1d6 points of damage to lawful targets. Charm: Command (Su)-The graven guardian can cast command three times per day as a spell-like ability. Community: Alliance (Su)-Adjacent worshipers and graven guardians dedicated to the same god gain a +1 luck bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and saves. Darkness: Darkness (Su)-The graven guardian can cast darkness two times per day as a spell-like ability. Death: Bleed (Ex)-The graven guardian's weapon deals 2 points of bleed damage on a hit. Destruction: Shatter (Ex)-The graven guardian can cast shatter two times per day as a spell-like ability. Earth: Rocky (Ex)-The graven guardian's natural armor bonus increases by +2. Evil: Evil Weapons (Su)-The graven guardian's weapon and slam attacks are treated as evil-aligned. Its magic weapon deals +1d6 points of damage to good targets. Fire: Flaming (Su)-The graven guardian's weapon gains the flaming property. Glory: Glorious (Su)-The graven guardian's magic weapon and slam attack deal an additional 1d6 points of damage against undead creatures. Good: Good Weapons (Su)-The graven guardian's weapon and slam attacks are treated as good-aligned. Its magic weapon deals +1d6 points of damage to evil targets Healing: Recovery (Su)-Once per day, when reduced below half hit points, the graven guardian automatically heals 3d10+6 points of damage. Knowledge: Familiarity (Su)-The graven guardian gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls again any creature it attacked in the past round. Law: Lawful Weapons (Su)-The graven guardian's weapons and slam attacks are treated as lawful-aligned. Its magic weapon deals +1d6 points of damage to chaotic targets. Liberation: Unfettered (Su)-The graven guardian gains a +4 bonus to its CMD. Luck: Lucky (Su)-Once per day, the graven guardian may roll a saving throw twice and take the better of the two results as the actual result. Madness: Confusion (Su)-The graven guardian can cast confusion once per day as a spell-like ability. Magic: Resistant (Su)-The graven guardian's SR increases by 5. Nobility: Honored (Su)-The graven guardian gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and combat maneuver checks. Plant: Entangle (Su)-The graven guardian can cast entangle three times per day as a spell-like ability. Protection: Protected (Su)-The graven guardian gains a +2 bonus on all saves. Repose: Rest Eternal (Su)- Damage dealt by the graven guardian resists any magical healing. Attempting to use magical healing to cure this damage requires a successful caster level check against the guardian's SR. This ability does not affect natural healing or healing provided by extraordinary abilities. Rune: Rune Carved (Su)-Runes cover the graven guardian. Whenever the graven guardian takes energy damage or energy damage fails to overcome its SR, for the next round, its attacks deal +1d6 points of damage of that energy type. If more than one type of energy attack occurs in a round, roll randomly to determine what kind of extra energy damage it deals. Strength: Powerful (Ex)-The graven guardian gains Power Attack as a bonus feat. Sun: Dazzling (Su)-When the graven guardian scores a critical hit with its magic weapon, a bright flash blinds the target for 1d4 rounds (Fortitude save negates). Travel: Speedy (Su)-The guardian gains Mobility as a bonus feat, and all of its modes of movement increase by +10 feet. Trickery: Trip (Su)-The graven guardian gains the trip ability with its melee weapon and slam attacks. War: Enhanced (Su)-The enhancement bonus of the graven guardian's weapon increases to +2. Water: Swimmer (Ex)-The guardian gains a swim speed equal to its base speed, and a Swim skill of +11. Weather: Shocking Weapon (Su)-The graven guardian's weapon gains the shock special ability. CONSTRUCTION A graven guardian's body must be sculpted from clay, stone, or wood, and adorned with precious stones, rare woods, or metal inlays worth 500 gp. The Hit Dice and size of graven guardians can be increased as though they were golems (Bestiary 158). GRAVEN GUARDIAN CL 7th; Price 18,500 gp CONSTRUCTION Requirements Craft Construct, greater magic weapon, haste, imbue with spell ability, make whole, stone shape, creator must be caster level 7th; Skill Craft (sculpture) or Craft (pottery) DC 15; Cost 9,500 gp</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Congeal Water (Su) Once per day, a fuath can surround a creature in a thin layer of magically viscous water as a standard action at a range of 30 feet. A target that fails a DC 10 Reflex save becomes entangled and must hold its breath or risk drowning. The target or an adjacent creature can spend a full-round action on its turn scraping off the clinging fluid, allowing a new Reflex save with a +2 bonus; otherwise, the effect lasts for 1d4 minutes. A fuath can use this ability even if there is no source of water nearby. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +1 racial bonus. Vulnerable to Sunlight (Ex) A fuath takes 1 point of Constitution damage after every hour it is exposed to sunlight. Water of a depth of at least 1 foot negates this harmful effect.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Drowners of sailors and sinkers of ships, a fuath (FOO-ah) is a wicked gremlin found in the sea. It climbs aboard ships in the dead of night to sever ropes, bore holes in barrels, soil provisions, and murder any hapless crew it puts to sleep or catches alone. It delights in drowning creatures by surrounding them with magically thickened water, cackling with wicked glee as its victims claw desperately for the air only inches from their mouths. A fuath wears seaweed, shells, and coral like other creatures wear armor, clothes, and jewelry. Its body is protected by a hard, hunchbacked carapace. It stands less than 2 feet tall and weighs 12 to 15 pounds. Fuaths don't share a common language with other types of gremlins, though they can pantomime to each other fairly effectively. They have a surprising rapport with other sea creatures, even foul-tempered beasts like reefclaws (Bestiary 2 234). Small groups of fuaths lair in sea caves or rocky crevices. Larger groups frequently lay claim to whole sections of ruined ships. Their lairs usually include several trained guard animals. Fuaths prefer the taste of "land-meat" to anything from the sea, and often raid shore and ships to slake their hunger. They adore sea hags to the point of worship.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Death Flood (Su) When a grodair is killed, it immediately explodes in a 15-foot-radius burst of highly pressurized water that deals 5d6 points of damage (DC 17 Reflex for half ). After the explosion, a successful DC 25 Survival check allows a creature to recover a cluster of strange organs from the remains. This cluster functions as a decanter of endless water for 2d6 hours, but can only produce a "stream" or "fountain" effect. Failing this Survival check by 5 or more causes the cluster to burst, dealing an additional 2d6 points of damage to that creature (no save) and destroying the organs entirely. The save DC is Constitution-based. Muddy Field (Su) As a standard action when on sand, soil, or other types of loose earth, a grodair can gush standing water into the area surrounding it. Upon doing so, the land within 15 feet of the grodair is treated as a shallow bog (Core Rulebook 427). This water remains as long as the grodair is within 15 feet and wishes to maintain the water. The bog instantly disperses as soon as the grodair is killed or moves out of the area. Water Blast (Ex) The grodair's ranged attack is a pressurized blast of water. This attack has a range of 60 feet with no range increment.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>A grodair is a bloated aquatic creature from the primal world of the fey. The bulbous sac on its spine is an extradimensional space that can contain thousands of gallons of water. The creature drains water (including small bits of debris and even very small creatures) from one place and releases it in another, typically creating boggy areas as it moves so it can travel more quickly than its tentacles can carry it. A grodair can rise up to 6 feet on its tentacles, measures 7 feet long, and weighs about 400 pounds. A grodair is intelligent, but extremely absentminded and careless. Its memory is poor, and it has difficulty remembering things it was told even 5 minutes prior- though it can recall some events of the distant past with perfect (and often frustrating) clarity.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Aquatic Elusion (Su) As a standard action, a grootslang that is fully immersed in water can teleport to another body of water without error. This ability functions like tree stride, but the grootslang can exit from any body of water within 1 mile so long as both the entry and exit are wide enough for the creature to enter. Impaling Bite (Ex) A grootslang can make a bite attack against any creature it is grappling with its tail. If this attack hits, it is automatically treated as a critical threat. Thunderous Stomp (Ex) As a full-round action, a grootslang can rear up on its serpentine body to bring its massive forelimbs down with awesome force. The grootslang chooses two adjacent targets to be affected as though trampling them. In addition, each creature within 10 feet must make a DC 28 Reflex save or be knocked prone. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Legends claim that the grootslang is a primordial creature as old as the world itself. Such tales state that in those ancient days, the gods-new to the crafting of things- made a terrible mistake in the grootslang's creation, for they gave it tremendous strength, cunning, and intellect. Upon realizing their mistake, the gods split the grootslang into separate creatures and thus created the first elephants and the first snakes. But one of the original grootslangs escaped, and from this first sire all other grootslangs were born. Scholars debate the veracity of such stories, and have looked to either biological or magical explanations of the creature's origins, but nevertheless bards and sages alike agree that the grootslang's fearsome reputation is well deserved. A grootslang's thick, leathery hide has a metallic sheen and a dull copper color, shot through with thin veins of green. Both males and females grow to a length of 60 feet and stand 20 feet tall. Little differentiation exists between sexes save for a lighter green hue to the female's hide. Grootslangs can weigh 20 tons and live up to 500 years. All grootslangs covet gems, particularly diamonds, and despite the creatures' lust for cruelty, victims can often bargain for their freedom by offering a grootslang enough precious gems.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Broken Ground (Su) The ground in a 30-foot radius around a guecubu ripples and shudders unnaturally. This transforms the area surrounding a guecubu into difficult terrain. A guecubu can move through this area with no penalty. Consecrated ground cannot be affected by this ability, nor can any area warded by a magic circle against chaos or a magic circle against evil. Misfortune (Su) A creature struck by a guecubu must make a DC 20 Will save or become permanently cursed with misfortune. The victim of this curse takes a -4 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks, and any critical threat against the victim automatically confirms. If a guecubu hits a creature already suffering from this curse, the victim must make a DC 20 Will save or be staggered for 1 round. This is a curse effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Often when a particularly evil criminal is executed, suspicious folk fear that the criminal's remains might rise from death to continue to plague the living. To combat this possibility, many mobs or rural justices take to the practice of burning the bodies, grinding the bones, and scattering the remains in the wild. Yet in the case of particularly evil criminals, even these steps are in vain, for their will is enough to reassemble a body from earth, stone, roots, and plants drawn from the region into which the remains were scattered. Such an undead horror rises as a guecubu, a harbinger of misfortune and vengeance from beyond the grave. A newly formed guecubu remembers well how its enemies treated it, and while the undead creature retains none of its previous life's talents, its undead state grants it many new tools to seek revenge with. Typically, a guecubu does not limit its revenge to those directly involved with its execution-entire villages and towns fall victim to its rage. The guecubu's tactics tend toward the subtle, and it seeks to spread misfortune and death on a person-by-person basis, slaying its enemies one at a time until they flee, so that all that remains is a ghost town. A guecubu is 6 feet tall and weighs 100 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Inhabit (Ex) A hellwasp swarm can enter the body of a helpless or dead creature by crawling into its mouth and other orifices. Inhabiting a body requires 1 minute, and the victim must be Small, Medium, or Large. The swarm can abandon the body at any time as a full-round action. Any attack against the host deals half damage to the hellwasp swarm as well, although the swarm's DR, resistances, and immunities may negate some or all of this damage. When a hellwasp swarm inhabits a dead body, it effectively transforms the corpse into a zombie of the appropriate size under the swarm's control. If a hellwasp swarm inhabits a living victim, it can neutralize the effects of its own poison and control the victim's movement and actions as if using dominate monster. Hellwasps quickly consume a living victim, dealing 2d4 points of Constitution damage per hour. A hellwasp-inhabited creature is easy to spot, since its skin crawls with the forms of the insects inside. A swarm can attempt a Disguise check to conceal its inhabitation of a host, with a -4 penalty if currently inhabiting a Small host. A remove disease or heal spell cast on an inhabited victim forces the hellwasp swarm to abandon its host. Poison (Ex) Swarm-injury; save Fort DC 20; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Dex; cure 2 consecutive saves.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Even Hell's fiendish inhabitants know to stay clear of the maddening buzz of hellwasp swarms. While individual hellwasps are mindless, when swarmed together they gain a hive mind that torments the living and the dead alike. Sages and diabolists argue as to why this happens, but a favored explanation is that all hellwasps contain the dispersed soul of some greater devil, scattered and imprisoned by his rivals for infractions lost to mortal knowledge. Though intelligent, these swarms are often difficult to understand and reason with. A hellwasp swarm can speak in a fashion with its myriad droning wings. The chatter is often little more than repetitive mantras of insults and the voicing of the twisted and base desires of the swarm. A hellwasp swarm has little use for reason, diplomacy, or discourse in other circumstances, for its desires are as savage as its home plane.</Description>

    <Description>A typical antelope stands a bit less than 3 feet at the shoulder, measures 4 feet in length, and weighs 60 pounds. In some species, both males and females have horns; in others, only males. Females that lack horns have the same statistics but lack an effective attack. Antelopes graze in large herds, ever on the watch for predators. Even the hint of a threat can send the whole herd springing away toward safer pastures. Antelopes rarely fight except among themselves during mating season or when cornered by a predator. The statistics presented above work well not only for numerous species of antelope, but also for smaller-sized, deerlike herbivores found throughout the world. Of course, not all antelopes are Small. You can generate statistics for larger antelope species, such as elands or kudus, by advancing the antelope presented above by 2 Hit Dice and increasing its size category to Medium. All antelopes of this size are CR 1 creatures.

    <Description>Elk range in great herds throughout the plains, hills, and forests of many wilderness areas. Their size, strength, and antlers allow them to contend with most of their environment's dangers, though herds generally favor flight to combat. Elk also prove exceptionally adaptable survivors, capable of living through severe weather changes without concern. Most breeds of elk stand between 3 and 5 feet tall and weigh between 350 and 550 pounds, with females far slighter than the males. Numerous species of elk exist. Some larger species can stand up to 6 feet tall at the shoulder and can be used as mounts by Medium humanoids; these elk have 3 Hit Dice and are Large. One particularly unusual species of elk, the river elk, is an excellent swimmer-these elk gain a swim speed of 30 feet. All elk of this size are CR 2 creatures.

    <SpecialAbilities>Spiked Tail (Ex) A hodag's tail spikes allow the creature's tail slap to deal both bludgeoning and piercing damage. A hodag's tail slap is a primary attack. Toss (Ex) A hodag charging 20 feet or more that damages a foe with an attack can throw its foe with a special combat maneuver check. The opponent must be corporeal and at least one size category smaller than the hodag. If the combat maneuver check succeeds, the hodag's opponent is thrown 10 feet through the air in a direction chosen by the hodag and falls prone. The hodag can only toss its opponent in a straight line If an obstacle prevents the creature's movement, both the creature tossed and the object struck take 1d6 points of damage, and the creature falls prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle. A hodag can also toss an opponent 10 feet up into the air. The victim lands in the same square it started in, falls prone, and takes 1d6 points of damage. Trackless (Ex) A hodag sweeps its tail behind itself in a way that obscures its tracks. Attempts to track a hodag have their normal DC increased by +10.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>As stout as a bull with a reptile's scaly, spiked body, hodags are legendary forest predators that hunt along the edges of civilization in thick woods. Green, gray, and black scales cover the beasts, helping them blend in amid underbrush, and sharp spikes stand along their backs and run down their powerful, dangerous tails. Loggers share stories of being followed by hodags and seeing their glowing red eyes in the otherwise oppressive darkness of the deep forest. In the wintertime, when snow and ice blankets the region, hodags grow a foul-smelling coat of greasy, dark brown fur that sprouts in tufts from between their scales. Many believe that hodags are not simply strong beasts but rather unique and specific terrors that have lived and hunted certain woodlands for ages. Others living near such wildernesses, however, consider hodags a myth, nothing more than the sort of tall tale that is typical of excitable rural folk. A male hodag measures 10 feet long and weighs 700 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Channel Negative Energy (Su) As a standard action, a hollow serpent can channel negative energy in a 30-foot burst as a 16th-level evil cleric. This ability requires no divine focus. The save DC is Charisma-based. Desiccation Aura (Su) A cloud of moisture-draining dust fills the air in a 30-foot radius around a hollow serpent. Living creatures within this area must make a DC 26 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Strength damage as water is leached from their flesh. Whether or not the save is successful, a creature cannot be affected again by the same hollow serpent's desiccation aura for 24 hours. Creatures without fleshy bodies are immune to this aura, while creatures with the aquatic or water subtypes take a -4 penalty on the saving throw. The save DC is Constitution-based. Life-Draining Coils (Su) A hollow serpent seethes with negative energy capable of sapping the life force of creatures trapped within its coils. Every time a creature takes constriction damage from a hollow serpent, it gains one negative level. The hollow serpent also gains 5 temporary hit points for each negative level it bestows. Lifesense (Su) A hollow serpent notices and locates living creatures within 60 feet, just as if it possessed the blindsight ability. Swift Strike (Ex) When a hollow serpent takes a full-attack action, it can make two bite attacks instead of just one.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Crafted from the shed skins of great snakes by serpentfolk necromancers and other foul spellcasters, hollow serpents are plagued by an eternal hunger they can never sate. The act of draining energy from living creatures blunts these supernatural pangs, driving the hollow serpent to constantly seek new prey. A hollow serpent is a difficult undead to create-most of them were crafted by a long-forgotten god of the serpentfolk and not by mortal spellcasters at all. The exact methods by which a mortal might create a hollow serpent are obscure, but most scholars have come to the conclusion that the use of powerful artifacts or the aid of a demigod may be required for such a feat. A hollow serpent is 15 feet long and weighs 500 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Aura of Faithlessness (Su) The huecuva and all undead creatures within 30 feet receive a +2 profane bonus on Will saves made to resist channeled energy and positive energy effects. Disease (Ex) Filth fever: Injury; save Fort DC 12; onset 1d3 days; frequency 1/day; effect 1d3 Dex damage and 1d3 Str damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Charisma-based. False Humanity (Su) During the day, a huecuva is cloaked in an illusion that makes it look, sound, and feel like the living creature it once was. This effect functions similarly to disguise self-if a creature interacts directly with a huecuva, it can attempt a DC 12 Will save to see through the illusion. Regardless, the huecuva's scent never changes-it always exudes a faint stench of grave dust and decay. Creatures with the scent ability receive a +4 bonus on any Will saving throw made to see through this illusion. At night (regardless of whether the huecuva itself knows night has fallen) this illusion fades and reveals the creature for what it truly is. The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Huecuvas are the risen corpses of heretical clerics who blasphemed and renounced their deities before meeting death. In unlife, they hate and seek to destroy those pious souls who keep their vows. Although easily mistaken for zombies or even skeletons, huecuvas have a spark of intelligence that makes them cunning and deceptive foes. During daylight hours, a huecuva becomes shrouded in an illusion that causes it to appear as it did in life-at these times, a huecuva might seek to infiltrate society to dwell among those it hates. When night falls, it emerges to seek out its prey. Fortunately for the living, the typical huecuva has only fragments of intellect remaining, so it is usually not long before the undead creature makes an error of judgment or simply reveals itself for the monster it is. Most huecuvas remember little of their former lives except for the blasphemies that led them to their cursed fates. They often find themselves drawn to the ruins of old temples, where they rage against or seek hopeless absolution from the deities who so aff licted them. Huecuvas sometimes work in concert with other undead creatures that share the same area. While most huecuvas arise when a god rejects a heretic priest's soul, forcing the slain to rise as horrible undead, a huecuva can also be created with create undead. The caster must be at least 11th level, and the body to be transformed must have been an evil cleric in life. The spell can be used to create a huecuva using the body of a nonevil cleric, but doing so requires a DC 20 caster level check.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Prismatic Aura (Su) As a swift action once per day, a humbaba can activate its prismatic aura. Doing so causes brilliant light to radiate from the humbaba to a radius of 30 feet. Each round at the start of the humbaba's turn, roll 1d8 and consult the table of prismatic spray effects on page 325 of the Core Rulebook to determine the color and effect of the light (reroll results of 8). If a creature begins its turn in the prismatic aura's area, it must make the appropriate saving throw (DC 26) against that effect. Once activated, a humbaba's prismatic aura lasts for 7 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Humbabas are monstrous humanoids of tremendous size and power that prowl the forgotten places of the world. Although a humbaba has the body of a powerful, muscular human, its face is a twisted mockery that seems more leonine than human. They often braid portions of their manes or otherwise decorate them with skulls and weapons, and prefer to wear half-plate armor and fight with longswords. The first humbabas were once the favored minions of the demon lord Pazuzu. In those days, humbabas had magnificent birdlike wings. But when the mightiest of the humbabas dared to attack Pazuzu in an ill-conceived attempt to claim the demon lord's throne, Pazuzu punished the entire humbaba race by stripping them of their wings and casting them into the Material Plane. There they now dwell, forever denied the skies and cursed to live lonely lives, incapable of forming even the barest of friendships or alliances with others of their kind.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Bewitching Brume (Su) Any creature within 10 feet of a hungry fog or currently being affected by its enveloping mists must succeed on a DC 8 Will save at the start of that creature's turn or become shaken for 1 round at the half-glimpsed shapes of phantoms floating within the fog. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. Enveloping Mists (Ex) A hungry fog can engulf foes (see Universal Monster Rules in the Appendices). A creature engulfed by a hungry fog does not gain the pinned condition and may move normally-such a creature is not in danger of suffocating, but as long as it begins its turn engulfed, it is staggered in addition to the damage the attack causes. The save DC to avoid the enveloping mists is Constitution-based. Gaseous (Ex) A hungry fog has a body composed of eerie mist. It can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, but cannot enter water or other liquid. It has no Strength score, and cannot manipulate objects as a result. Vulnerable to Wind (Ex) A hungry fog is treated as a Tiny creature for the purposes of determining the effects high wind has upon it (see page 439 of the Core Rulebook).</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>This eerie, vaporous ooze slips silently through the air, a roiling cloud of green fog within which dance the indistinct shapes of twisted, spooky ghosts. Despite its haunting appearance, and despite the fact that hungry fogs often dwell in old graveyards or hunt battlefields, a hungry fog is not an undead creature. Rather, it is a form of gaseous ooze infused with negative energy. Thus, while a hungry fog is not an undead creature, undead gain considerable boons by fighting within a hungry fog, for its mists heal them as surely as they drain vitality from the living creatures caught within. Within a hungry fog, the ooze's mists interact strangely with fragments of those it has consumed, creating eerie phantasms of its past victims. Periodically, one of these shapes might flash with light as if momentarily holding a lantern aloft, but as soon as the figure is approached, it fades away into the surrounding mists, often giving the observer a quick and unsettling glimpse of a skull-like countenance. These shapes, like the fog itself, are not truly undead, but the fact that a hungry fog is hurt by positive energy as surely as if it were helps to blur the distinction and spread even more confusion about its actual nature. A hungry fog is instinctively drawn to areas where negative energy is strong. These nocturnal creatures are particularly fond of sites that are haunted, such as old houses, abandoned graveyards, or shipwrecks along shorelines-although their vulnerability to high winds means that they are rarely encountered in areas where storms are common.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Disease (Su) An iku-turso's bite inflicts a strange, supernatural disease called tursas. This disease causes the victim's skin to grow painfully scaly, causes strange hallucinations, and eventually transforms the victim into an iku-turso. Tursas: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 20; onset 1 minute; frequency 1/day; effect 1d3 Wis damage and 1d6 Cha drain; cure 2 consecutive saves. As long as a victim suffers any ability damage from tursas, it gains the ability to breathe water. A creature reduced to 0 Charisma by this disease transforms into a fully grown and healthy iku-turso-it immediately forgets its previous life and abilities and seeks out the nearest iku-turso community to join it. A wish or miracle can reverse this transformation. The save DC is Constitution-based. Light Lure (Su) As a standard action, an iku-turso can call forth a few small points of light, functioning like a dancing lights spell (CL equals the iku-turso's HD) except as described here. Creatures within 100 feet of one of these lights must make a DC 18 Will save upon sighting them or be compelled to approach them by the safest and most direct path. A creature that successfully saves is immune to the same iku-turso's light lure for 24 hours. If a subject of this effect has to move through hazardous terrain to reach the lights, that subject receives another saving throw to end the effect before entering the hazardous terrain. This effect ends once the character reaches the light or takes any form of damage. This is a visual mind-affecting charm effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Iku-tursos are hideous denizens of the deep sea. There, they venerate sinister gods of plague and contagion and torment victims plucked from ship and shore in special air-filled torture chambers. Disease is sacred to the iku-tursos, and those who suffer from sickness are considered blessed-an iku-turso often chooses to leave obviously diseased victims to their fates rather than attempt to capture them.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Change Shape (Su) A jackalwere has three forms. Its natural form is that of a jackal, but it can also take the form of a human or a human-jackal hybrid. A jackalwere's human form is fixed-it cannot assume different human forms. A jackalwere can use its sleep gaze in any of its forms. In jackal form, it functions as a dog (Bestiary 87). In its hybrid form, a jackalwere can make a bite attack as a secondary attack, while in human form it lacks its bite attack entirely. A jackalwere can shift into any of its three alternate forms as a move action. Equipment does not meld with the new form between human and hybrid forms but does between those forms and its jackal form. Jackal Empathy (Ex) A jackalwere can communicate and empathize with jackals (use stats for Small dog; see Bestiary 87), and can use Bluff as if it were Diplomacy to change a jackal's attitude, receiving a +4 racial bonus to do so. Sleep Gaze (Su) Sleep for 3 minutes (a standard action rouses the creature, as does damage), 30 feet, Will DC 12 negates. A creature that succeeds at the saving throw cannot be affected by the same jackalwere's sleep gaze for 24 hours. This is a sleep effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. Weapon Intuition (Ex) A jackalwere is proficient with simple and martial melee weapons.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Jackalweres are evil, supernatural jackals born with the ability to assume human form. Some folks superstitiously consider jackalweres to be emissaries of evil spirits or wicked desert gods, and it is easy to understand why, as they can take the shape of a human and possess a keen intellect; however, they also have a taste for murder and humanoid flesh. In its hybrid form, a jackalwere stands 6 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Poison (Ex) Tentacle-injury; save Fort DC 14; frequency 1/ round for 6 rounds; effect 1 Con and 1 Cha; cure 2 consecutive saves. If a creature fails two consecutive saving throws, its jaw locks, its tongue swells, and its lips pull back, making speech impossible. This condition ends when the Charisma damage is healed.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Most common in warm or temperate waters, the death's head jellyfish is an aggressive predator. The creature derives its name from the pattern on its 4-foot-wide bell and from the poison it delivers with its tentacles. Those unfortunate enough to be subjected to this toxin develop rigor of the facial muscles that results in a wide-eyed grimace if left untreated.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Electricity Blast (Ex) Once every 1d6 rounds as a standard action, a sapphire jellyfish can discharge a 20-foot-radius blast of electricity, dealing 8d6 points of electricity damage (DC 22 Reflex for half ). Any creature that takes damage from this electricity must also make a DC 22 Fortitude save to avoid being staggered for 1d4 rounds. Poison (Ex) Tentacle-injury; save Fort DC 23; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Dex and 1d4 Con; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Like other giant jellyfish, a sapphire jellyfish is an active hunter. It stores powerful electrical charges in its domelike bell, which is 16 feet in diameter. Its sensory tentacles can trail for twice that length, but the dangerous toxic tentacles are positioned within about 20 feet of the creature's bell.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Poison (Ex) Bite-injury; save Fort DC 23; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Wisdom damage; cure 3 saves. Spider Empathy (Ex) This ability functions as a druid's wild empathy, save that it works only on spiders. A jorogumo gains a racial bonus on this check equal to her Hit Dice (normally +14). Spiders are normally mindless, but this empathic communication imparts upon them a modicum of implanted intelligence, allowing the jorogumo to train them and use them as guardians (though it does not grant them skills or feats). Spider Legs (Ex) A jorogumo's spider legs can emerge or retract as a free action. When a jorogumo's spider legs are present, she gains a +8 circumstance bonus on Climb checks and gains Deflect Arrows as a bonus feat. Swift Shapechanger (Ex) A jorogumo can assume spider or human form as a swift action.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Jorogumos are seductive schemers who secret themselves away in isolated mountain valleys where they lure travelers, especially men, to their dooms. Exclusively female, jorogumos must mate with humanoids to produce fertile eggs. After copulation, a jorogumo paralyzes her partner by poisoning him into a coma. She lays a single egg within the father's body, then cocoons the corpse and hides the victim. Periodic visits to re-poison the victim ensure his coma lasts for the 2d4 days required for the young jorogumo to hatch and feed. Jorogumos are enthusiastic enemies of tengus and attack them on sight-they never take tengus as "mates."</Description>

    <Description_Visual>This enormous bird has a lizardlike tail and bright purple feathers on its back and wings; the rest of its body is bare and scaly.</Description_Visual>
    <Source>PFRPG Bestiary 3</Source>
    <IsTemplate>0</IsTemplate>
    <SpecialAbilities>Adaptive Defense (Su) When first encountered, a jubjub bird has no energy resistance. When damaged by an attack that causes cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage, it gains resistance 30 to that energy type until the end of its next turn. If an attack causes more than one type of energy damage, the jubjub bird gains resistance 30 to all the types of energy damage dealt. Deadly Bite (Ex) A jubjub bird applies 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier to damage dealt by its bite attack. A successful critical hit decapitates and instantly slays a Large or smaller victim (DC 33 Fortitude negates decapitation; creatures without a head are immune to this effect) and deals triple normal damage regardless of the decapitation result. The save DC is Strength-based. Planar Acclimation (Ex) A jubjub bird is always considered to be on its home plane, regardless of what plane it finds itself upon. It never gains the extraplanar subtype. Shriek (Ex) Once every 1d6 rounds as a standard action, a jubjub bird can voice a piercing screech. All creatures (other than jubjub birds) within a 60-foot-radius spread must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. This is a sonic effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The jubjub bird is a rare and dangerous bird that resembles a giant dodo bird, but with long, muscular legs and wings that provide functional, if awkward, flight. When attacked with magic, a jubjub bird's plumage shifts randomly in hue and pattern with each spell hurled against it. Like the bandersnatch and other legendary creatures such as the jabberwock, the jubjub bird originally hails from the primal world of the fey. It has the dubious honor of being the least powerful and least intelligent of these creatures, which are known collectively as the "Tane," yet one should never assume that the jubjub bird is a pushover-its penchant for snapping off heads with its razor-sharp beak can quickly put such ideas to rest. Powerful fey sometimes keep jubjub birds as guardians, and there are even reports of giants (particularly powerful tribes of jungle giants) using them as mounts. Such avian allies must be carefully trained, for few giants and fey are able to comfortably exist alongside a creature so prone to uttering such stunning shrieks so often. Jubjub birds stand about 20 feet tall and weigh roughly 6,000 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Breath Weapon (Su) A kamadan can exhale a cone of gas that makes living creatures fall asleep for 5 minutes (Fortitude DC 15 negates). Slapping or wounding awakens a creature put to sleep by this attack, but normal noise does not. This is a sleep effect. The save DC is Constitution-based. Snakes (Ex) A kamadan's snakes attack simultaneously; this is always a secondary attack. Kamadans are wicked hunters that enjoy stalking and toying with prey, especially when their quarry is relatively intelligent. When a kamadan attacks, it first uses its soporific breath, then pounces on any targets that remain awake. Kamadans stand about 3 feet at the shoulder, about 9 feet long and weighing up to 500 pounds.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Although kamadans are certainly magical creatures, they share many psychological and sociological traits with other big cats. Even when hunting alone to avoid competition, a kamadan is often a member of a larger pride. In areas where wildlife or natives are more powerful, kamadan packs are more likely to hunt as a unit. Kamadans prefer underground lairs, but settle for rocky outcroppings or dens inside brambles or other thick bushes, and they use their snakes to manipulate the bones and baubles of their prey into decorative arrangements. Occasionally, a kamadan shares its lair with another creature, but only if the other creature is more powerful or plies the kamadan regularly with tributes of food and treasure. Though the above statistics represent the most common breed of kamadan, two rarer but more dangerous variants are detailed in brief below. Dusk Kamadan (CR +1): A dusk kamadan has midnight black fur and snakes bearing black and red ring patterns on their bodies. A dusk kamadan has the advanced creature template, and its snakes have a poisonous bite: Snakes- injury; save Fort DC 17; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Con; cure 2 consecutive saves. Polar Kamadan (CR +2): A polar kamadan has white fur with black spots like a snow leopard. Its snakes are furred as well. A polar kamadan has the advanced creature template and batlike wings that grant it a fly speed of 60 ft. (average). The breath weapon of a polar kamadan is particularly cold-those who succumb to it also suffer 1d4 points of Dexterity damage from numbness.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Infused Quarterstaff (Su) Any quarterstaff a jinushigami wields functions as a +5 quarterstaff (unless the quarterstaff already has a greater enhancement bonus). If a jinushigami is within its regional ward, it can create a Gargantuan quarterstaff out of the surrounding terrain as a standard action. Manipulate Terrain (Su) A jinushigami can help any number of creatures travel within its territory. Creatures aided in this way receive a +10 bonus on Survival checks and do not suffer reductions to overland movement from terrain or lack of a highway or other roadway, regardless of the presence of roads or the type of terrain they actually travel through. Alternatively, a jinushigami can make terrain more difficult for any number of creatures to travel through, imparting a -10 penalty on all Survival checks and causing overland movement to be reduced to one-tenth its normal speed. A jinushigami can affect as many creatures as it wishes with this ability, selecting whether it aids or impedes travel for each, as long as it can notice the creature and the creature is within its regional ward. A jinushigami may use this ability while merged with its ward. Ward (Su) A jinushigami treats an entire region as its ward. This region can be a single forest, swamp, mountain, lake, or any other natural feature, with a maximum radius of 5 miles. Most jinushigami have smaller regional wards, since not all regions are large enough to fill this area, but no region with a radius smaller than 1 mile radius can support (or deserves) a jinushigami. As long as it is within its territory (either merged with it or in its physical form), a jinushigami can observe the world from any point within its regional ward as if it were at that point. While merged with its ward, it can observe all points simultaneously in this way. As a standard action, it can convey information about a creature within its ward (effectively imparting a description and exact location) to all kami within its regional ward.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Guardians of significant natural wonders like mountains, large lakes, forests, and so on, jinushigami (known also as land kami) are the most powerful and revered of all kami, commanding the very forces of nature itself to ensure the safety and security of their wards. These potent spirits garner the most respect among other kami, wielding great inf luence over both them and the native creatures that dwell within their territories. Jinushigami tend to stay hidden amongst their land, however, knowing that their intimate tie with the environment makes them highly desirable targets among those who would seek to do harm to nature. Strangers to lands protected by jinushigami are well-advised to take the utmost care to not offend the powerful spirit creatures. When displeased, jinushigami can eradicate trails and warp the contours of their terrain, forcing travelers to endure unreasonable hardship in travel. These goliaths have little patience for those who would defile their efforts, and offenders who fail to listen to a jinushigami's initial hints quickly discover how devastating the kami's powers can be as they are forced from the land either by the lesser kami who serve their superior or by the towering jinushigami itself. Of course, those who respect and honor the jinushigami see the kami's other side, as the kami eases their travel by lessening undergrowth, shifting rivers, and otherwise providing subtle but incredible aid to travelers. Jinushigami are ancient and wise, and while they are no fools, they prefer to give visitors to their domains the benefit of the doubt. Only when an individual makes known his disruptive intentions toward the structure and cohesion of nature does a jinushigami react with violence. Of course, those who align themselves with naturally opposing forces of the kami, such as the oni, do not receive this friendly grace period, and a jinushigami can perceive most treacherous thoughts, sensing a suspicious visitor through its connection with the land, then tracking it down to stealthily observe it more closely. A jinushigami is 38 feet tall and weighs over 30,000 pounds. When they manifest physical bodies, they appear as lumbering humanoid forms made of earth and stone and plant matter, sometimes with strange humanoid affectations like hats or jewelry. ELDER JINUSHIGAMI Of all the kami, land kami are the most ancient and powerful, yet even among these immense outsiders there are variations in that power. Newly formed jinushigami have statistics as presented above, but a jinushigami grows more powerful as the legend and fame of the site it guards grows. For example, a jinushigami of part of a mountain range is impressive, but a jinushigami whose region includes the range's tallest mountain is even more so. When a jinushigami becomes this powerful, it is known as an elder jinushigami. An elder jinushigami is generally a Colossal creature, and rarely has fewer than 28 Hit Dice-most are between CR 22 and CR 25, although exact details vary. An elder jinushigami's ward can cover a much larger area than that of a typical jinushigami, usually with a radius of 1 mile per CR possessed by the elder jinushigami. An elder jinushigami also gains additional spell-like abilities to more closely ref lect its role in the world. Listed below are several examples. Glacier Kami: An elder jinushigami associated with a vast glacier, be it one that carves mountains or runs along a polar coastline, appears as a humanoid made of blocks of ice. These kami have the cold subtype instead of the earth subtype (and thus gain immunity to cold and vulnerability to fire), and can use cone of cold and wall of ice as spell-like abilities three times per day each. Great Reef Kami: An elder jinushigami whose domain contains a sizable coral reef of considerable age appears as a humanoid constructed of living coral draped with seaweed. Great reef kami have the water subtype instead of the earth subtype, gain the aquatic subtype (and the amphibious special quality), gain a swim speed of 60 ft., and gain the ability to use tsunami (Advanced Player's Guide 251) once per day as a spell-like ability. Mountain Kami: When an elder jinushigami's ward includes the tallest peak in a range or region, it gains the use of flesh to stone and wall of stone three times per day each. Volcano Kami: An elder jinushigami that includes in its ward an active volcano appears as a humanoid made of equal parts molten rock and solid stone. A volcano kami has the fire subtype instead of the earth subtype (and thus gains immunity to fire and vulnerability to cold), can use fireball three times per day as a spell-like ability, and can use wall of lava (Advanced Player's Guide 255) once per day as a spell-like ability.</Description>

    <Description>Revered by druids and rangers for their attunement with the wilds, kodama, known also as tree kami, are the guardians of the wild trees of the forest-they do not protect trees cultivated and grown in civilized areas. (Those trees are protected by different kami, if at all.) A kodama takes a single tree under its protection; typically, all of the trees in a forest that are protected by kodama are clustered together in one particular area. A kodama in its physical form resembles a barely humanoid creature with only the vaguest of features on its semispherical head. A tree kami is 3 feet tall and weighs 60 pounds. While one might expect the kami of something as large as a tree to itself be larger, the fact that forests are made up of so many trees tends to diminish the singular "presence" any single tree might have. In cases where a tree is particularly ancient or immense, however, the kodama associated with it is much larger-statistics for such rare kodama can be generated by advancing the kodama given here by several Hit Dice and increasing its size-theoretically, a Colossal kodama with more than 20 Hit Dice could exist somewhere in the world. Not all kodama increase in power by gaining racial Hit Dice, though, as some instead progress by gaining class levels, particularly levels of druid, though a rare few kodama kami-those possessed of minds more ordered and structured than is normal for their race-take the path of the monk. Kodama are more curious about visitors than most kami, and often manifest their physical bodies simply to watch and observe newcomers to their groves. A kodama usually manifests on the far side of its tree, or in the shadows of the undergrowth, so that it can slowly step out into visibility to quietly observe with its distracting, empty-eyed gaze. This gaze can be particularly unnerving. Those who have fallen under its supernatural effects often have different descriptions of how the gaze made them feel (ashamed, frightened, curious, amused, and nervous being the most common reactions), yet the end result is essentially the same. While under observation by a curious kodama, few are those who can continue their actions without being at least somewhat distracted by the kami's attention. When a kodama must fight (typically in order to defend its tree or other kami), it moves quickly-kodama work best in groups, and when confronted alone generally use tree stride to travel to another part of the forest to raise a small host of allies to aid</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Improvised Weapon Mastery (Ex) A shikigami gains Catch Off-Guard and Throw Anything as bonus feats, and adds its Charisma modifier instead of its Strength modifier to damage done with any improvised weapon, as attacks it makes with such weapons seem supernaturally lucky in landing damaging blows. Although a shikigami is Tiny, it never provokes attacks of opportunity when it attacks an adjacent foe with a melee weapon. If a shikigami critically hits an opponent with an improvised weapon, it deals x3 damage.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Shikigami are the least of the kami, yet they make up for their lowly status with their loyalty and bravery. Unlike most other well-known types of kami, shikigami are more often associated with rural and urban regions than with natural settings. These kami are the protectors of the minor works of civilization-things like milestones, waymarkers, tiny garden statues, and other relatively mundane works of art crafted by humanoid hands. No two shikigami look exactly alike, as bef its a race of kami that associates with such a wide range of wards. While all shikigami have the ability to merge with their wards, these kami are also fond of spending time in their physical forms, watching over their wards either invisibly or in the form of a tiny statue. In combat, a shikigami fights with whatever objects it finds at hand. Although relatively weak, these improvised weapons have an uncanny knack for hitting harder than they should. Shikigami are as friendly and curious as other kami, but they are quick to leave an area they see as being polluted by ideals that disrupt the virtues of nature. When they do, they generally take their wards with them. They do not engage humanoids who desecrate the environment, but their absence leaves a profound mark on the morale of perceptive villagers. Should the shikigami leave, town officials who know the function of the miniature kami are quick to change policies in their community to ref lect a more naturalistic approach, hoping to rekindle the relationship between shikigami and people, lest the community fall into the disfavor of more powerful and less passive kami. Shikigami typically stand 2 feet tall and weigh 30 pounds, or 50 pounds when taking their statue forms. A spellcaster must have the Improved Familiar feat, an alignment of lawful neutral, and an arcane caster level of 7th or higher to gain a shikigami familiar. Whenever a shikigami becomes a familiar, it treats its master as its ward.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Touch of Ages (Su) When a toshigami hits a target with a touch attack or any melee weapon, the target must succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save to avoid being magically aged. When a toshigami strikes a foe, it must decide whether it wishes to physically increase the target's age or mentally reduce the target's age. If it increases the target's physical age, the target takes 1 point of Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution drain. If it decreases the target's mental age, the target takes 1 point of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma drain. Combined with the toshigami's numerous attacks, this can quickly devastate a target, but once a target succeeds at its saving throw against the touch of ages, it can no longer be affected by this ability for 1 round. This is a magical aging effect, but does not actually alter the victim's true age-it merely simulates the creeping effect of age on the flesh or the reversion to an increasingly infantile state of mind. The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Toshigami, known also as blossom kami, are associated with cherry trees-particularly those that grow in inhabited areas. Often, long after a city has fallen to ruin, these kami guardians are all that remain to remember the lost city's glory. In this way, the toshigami are also associated with the passing of time. Toshigami rarely show themselves except to those in dire need or who are harming their trees. Still, they have a fascination with mortals, and have even been known to form romantic relationships with them on occasion. A toshigami is 5 feet tall and weighs 100 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Healing Arrow (Su) As a swift action, a zuishin can infuse an arrow it fires to carry any of the following effects: breath of life, cure light wounds, heal, neutralize poison, remove curse, remove disease, or restoration. Using one of these effects consumes a use of the same spell-like ability. The zuishin must make a touch attack to deliver the effect to the target-the target takes no damage from the arrow. Holy Weapons (Su) Any weapon wielded by a zuishin is treated as if it had the holy special ability. A zuishin creates arrows out of nothing as part of its attacks with any bow it wields.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>While all kami are enemies of oni, none are so fervent as the zuishin. Known also as shrine kami, zuishin take as their wards gates, doorways, religious places, and the spiritual archways known as torii, ensuring that the gates are respected. Zuishin can use many weapons, but tend to favor the bow. A zuishin treats its equipment with utmost care, viewing weapons as extensions of itself. It never discards its bow voluntarily; if the weapon is ever lost or destroyed, a zuishin can craft a new one in a month. Zuishin treat other kami with respect, and are always willing to lend a helping hand. Creatures other than kami must earn a zuishin's trust before receiving its aid, and do so by honoring the gate it guards or providing an offering to the kami, such as a tree branch or other small piece of nature. Zuishin manifest as suits of armor with a partly manifest warrior within, and wield glowing weapons. They stand 5 feet tall and weigh 120 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Head Bowl (Su) The basin atop a kappa's head contains water from its home river or lake. The water is emptied only if the kappa willingly tips its head or a creature pinning the kappa forces it to do so (requiring a grapple check while pinned). If the water is emptied, the kappa becomes immobile and staggered. It can still take actions, but it cannot move from the spot on its own. If the emptied head bowl is refilled with water, the kappa recovers from this condition immediately. This replacement water doesn't have to be from the kappa's home, but the kappa refills its head bowl from there at its first opportunity.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>A kappa is a strange amphibian resembling a humanoid turtle. It dwells in fresh water, preferring a stream or river to a lake or pond. It has a small shell on its back, a blunt face, and webbed hands and feet that end in short claws. A typical kappa is green in color, but kappa skin tones can vary toward blue or yellow hues. The creature has a shallow basin in the top of its head, in which the creature carries water from its home at all times. Kappas are puckish and like to play tricks on those who pass near or swim in their home. Kappa pranks are usually harmless and annoying, such as peeking under robes, stealing a bathers' clothing, or pretending to be an aquatic predator. A kappa might also challenge others to grappling matches, hoping potential foes underestimate its wrestling ability. An angry kappa can be dangerous, attempting to drown mounts, animal companions, or even people who enter its home waters. The most degenerate kappas have been known to drown bathers and eat them. Those wise to the ways of kappas know the creatures have a few weaknesses. First of all, kappas love cucumbers and horsef lesh. If plied with such treats, a kappa is likely to not bother intruders, and might even be convinced to offer aid. Further, despite a kappa's penchant for pranks, it is unfailingly polite to courteous visitors. A kappa confronted with a verbal rebuke rather than combat quickly and almost shamefully apologizes for its pranks, begging for forgiveness. If its head bowl is emptied, a kappa usually remains stationary and pleads for help, continuing to fight only if forced to. An opponent who refills the kappa's head bowl after spilling it receives the kappa's deepest gratitude. Only the wisest and smartest of kappa carry flasks of water with them when they are forced to travel far from their home-most kappa don't think this far ahead.</Description>

    <Description>Not quite man nor ape, the kech is a hairless primate that dwells in the deepest jungles. There they live in sizable tribes, relying upon their uncanny coloration and skill with bows to hunt prey. The green-and-brown camouflage coloration of a kech's flesh shifts and adapts to all surroundings to aid in stealth, but works particularly well in forests or jungles. This, combined with its uncanny ability to move through any terrain and leave no trace of its passage, makes the kech a masterful ambush hunter. A kech is 6 feet tall and weighs 240 pounds. These creatures prefer to dwell in ruined jungle buildings, and when presented with an opportunity to seize a remote town, slaughter the citizens, and move in, the typical kech tribe does not hesitate. Keches are as cruel as they are stealthy, and most jungle villages do not realize that they are under attack by a band of keches until the battle is already decided, with more than half the village dead in their beds, never having had the chance to awake and sound an alarm. Once a village does rouse to mount a resistance, the keches often seek to subdue remaining victims rather than kill them. Those who are slaughtered are inevitably eaten within 24 hours as part of a tremendous victory feast. Prisoners are often kept in cages in close proximity to the feasting, for keches enjoy the sound of wailing as their victims watch their kin being consumed. A kech tribe is typically led by a chieftain with 2-4 levels of ranger or fighter. Keches value magical support, particularly divine magic, for the jungle has no shortage of methods to wound, poison, or sicken those who dwell within. A kech cleric is as likely to worship an evil deity as it is one of the Four Horsemen or an evil elemental lord, but most kech priests are in fact druids. The combination of restorative magic and power over the natural world is often too seductive a path for a devout kech to ignore. Kech druids typically take apes as animal companions, and even tribes that lack druids generally have a few well-trained guard apes among them. Cannibalism is seen as a particularly vile taboo by keches-this prohibition extends to the consumption of ape or monkey flesh, but notably does not extend to the flesh of humanoids.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Spells A kirin casts spells as a 6th-level sorcerer, and can cast spells from the cleric list as well as those normally available to a sorcerer. Cleric spells are considered arcane spells for a kirin, meaning that the creature does not need a divine focus to cast them.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The noble kirin roam the sky, their feet rarely touching soil. They have a stag's graceful body and cloven hooves, a pair of backward-facing horns, and a thick mane and tail ranging from golden to brilliant reds or purples in the hues of the setting sun. Their hide resembles that of a dragon, the scales gleaming ebon or iridescent green. Rare in the extreme, kirin seldom meddle openly in worldly affairs, preferring a subtle hand in overturning the schemes of wicked spirits such as hags and oni. The blood of young kirin runs hot, however, and such spirited youths may serve as mounts for cavaliers and paladins of clever wit and untarnished moral quality. The wisest and most powerful kirin are known as emperor kirin, having earned this title through the respect of their peers and the strength of their powers. They resemble standard kirin, except their hooves give off sparks as they gallop through the air. Emperor kirin have the advanced creature simple template and additional racial Hit Dice. When advancing a kirin's Hit Dice to create an emperor kirin, make the following additional changes. • CR: Increase by 1 + the number of additional HD. • Breath Weapon: Damage increases by 1d6 for every 2 additional HD. • Spellcasting: Increase sorcerer level (for the purpose of spells known and spells per day) by 1 per additional HD. • Spell-Like Abilities: Increase caster level by +1 per additional HD. • Spell Resistance: Increase by +1 per additional HD.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Piercing Beak (Ex) A kongamato's beak is extremely hard and adept at breaking objects. When attempting to damage an item, a kongamato's beak attack does double damage and is treated as if it were adamantine for the purposes of overcoming the object's hardness. Wailing Dive (Su) When a kongamato makes a charge while flying or uses its Flyby Attack feat, the creature's body becomes infused with energy, causing its bite to deal an extra +1d6 points of sonic damage on that attack.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Kongamatos are primeval dragons that hunt the deep jungles of the world. Although not as intelligent or magically adept as their "true" cousins, kongamatos are respected and feared for their resilience and awesome strength. While the kongamato's body is clearly draconic- squat and dense with sharp claws capping each of its four limbs-the creature's head is distinctly avian, with a long, toothless beak and a pronounced crest. A kongamato's hide is a rich emerald hue, with an ash-colored underbelly and crimson webbing on its broad wings. Females have smaller head-crests than males, and a rosy hue colors both the undersides of their wings and their underbellies. Kongamatos are apex predators that make their lairs in the tops of the oldest and strongest trees, or in caves and ruins. Kongamatos are carnivorous and prey on large herd animals. Although they do not have teeth, their beaks are sharp and strong, allowing them to carve their kills with precision and to punch through wood, rock, and even metal. When possible, kongamatos hunt on the perimeter of their territories, gliding silently and gracefully through even the thickest forest foliage to surprise prey. Both males and females grow to a length of almost 30 feet, with an equally broad wingspan, and can weigh up to 7 tons. Kongamatos live between 500 and 600 years.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Unnerving Gaze (Ex) A creature that succumbs to an augur's unnerving gaze becomes shaken for 1 round.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Gory sentinels with a lust for flesh and the myriad bodily fluids contained within, augurs number among the most common-as well as most despicable-kytons on the Plane of Shadow. Having given up their humanoid bodies in favor of the more stealthy and wretched guise of a singular large eye armored in bloodied metal plates, augurs act as spies and sycophants for more powerful kytons. Their miniscule size, sturdy exterior, and unnerving gazes make them ideally equipped for dangerous reconnaissance missions to the Material Plane, where the augurs are able to scout out potential raiding locations or spot vulnerable, lone travelers before their more powerful kyton brethren cross the planes to attack. While their usefulness in tasks of stealth and guile makes augurs deadly companions, their insatiable lust for blood often proves their ultimate downfall. Augurs, like most kytons, find themselves in a heightened state of arousal when witness to the destruction of flesh, but the extent to which these muscular orbs find pleasure in blood is far more treacherous than their more disciplined peers. Many augurs cannot help but indulge themselves when exposed to gore-rolling within and dipping their blades into freshly spilled pools-an unfortunate trait which has led many careless augurs to their capture or doom. An augur's gruesome appearance is not always self-inflicted. They are sometimes constructed by other kytons who seek to impose an everlasting punishment upon a particularly unwilling mortal sacrifice; the defiant individual's body is cast aside for scraps as its mind and soul are transferred into the monocular shell, producing an augur when the ritual is complete. Augurs are the least pragmatic type of all kytons, and thus the least respected among their peers. The condemnation of an individual's spirit to the cage-like body of a kyton augur is the precedent for a truly agonizing and lonely existence. A lawful evil spellcaster can gain an augur as a familiar at 7th level by taking the Improved Familiar feat. A typical augur kyton is 1 foot in diameter and weighs 30 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Immune to Pain (Su) An eremite is immune to nonlethal damage, as well as to all magical effects associated with extreme pain, such as a symbol of pain, another eremite's pain attack, or similar effects at the GM's discretion. Evisceration (Ex) When an eremite grapples a foe, it can quickly eviscerate or otherwise surgically alter its victim by excising a bit of flesh or a part of an internal organ as a swift action, causing the victim to take 1d8 points of ability drain-the exact ability score drained is chosen by the eremite. The victim can resist this effect with a DC 28 Fortitude save. The save DC is Dexterity-based. Graft Flesh (Su) Once per day, an eremite may graft any bit of flesh or bone harvested via its evisceration ability within the previous hour to its own body as a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity. Doing so grants the eremite the effects of a heal and a greater restoration spell (caster level 20th). Pain (Su) Any creature struck by an eremite's natural attacks must make a DC 30 Fortitude save or become staggered for 1 round from the pain. As long as a creature is staggered by this effect, it takes a -4 penalty on all saving throws made to resist the eremite's spell-like and extraordinary abilities. The save DC is Constitution-based. Shadow Traveler (Ex) When an eremite uses plane shift to travel to the Plane of Shadow, it arrives at its intended destination with complete accuracy. When an eremite uses shadow walk, it moves at a rate of 100 miles per hour. Unnerving Gaze (Ex) A creature that succumbs to an eremite's unnerving gaze becomes paralyzed with fear for 1d4 rounds as it finds itself almost longing to submit its flesh to the kyton. At the end of any round it remains paralyzed in this way, the victim must make a DC 31 Will save or take 1d4 points of Wisdom drain from encroaching madness. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Eremites are among the eldest and most mutilated of kytons, having inflicted such massive damage to themselves that they feel little pain and no fear. The typical eremite is completely covered in blood-caked bandages, tattered cords of black leather, and thousands of jagged shards of razor-sharp metal. These fragments are all that holds the creature's mutilated flesh together, yet they do so with a strength far greater than that granted by mortal flesh and bone. Rather than concentrating solely on physical or even spiritual alterations, eremites seek to blur the very lines around being, physicality, and individuality. They desire only the most powerful beings to augment themselves with, traveling across vast swaths of the Material Plane in search of the most promising additions to their bodily collection and harvesting only the finest parts-the ripest spleen, the most alluring veins, the most succulent eyes. When an eremite encounters a creature that possess a so-called "perfect part," the powerful kyton seeks to capture that creature alive so that it can study how that perfect part functions as part of the creature's physiology before it finally decides to surgically remove it and attach it to its own body-often in a way not quite in keeping with the part's original use. A gifted bard's tongue might, for example, be nailed to a kyton's palm or sewn into its heart, while the eyes of a beautiful queen might be stitched into the kyton's torso. To the eremite, these hideous changes and choices somehow enhance the perfection of the harvested part, while to others they merely enhance the horror that the creature represents. While eremites do hold an appreciation for inspection of their targets as well as introspection regarding their own powers and identity, their primary occupation is the understanding of pain and suffering, which they pursue by inflicting the most heinous cruelties upon their victims. An eremite seeks to deliver as much agony as possible to its victims after capturing them, allowing them to undergo extreme amounts of trauma before letting them perish. An eremite often rends its own flesh in the same manner as it does its victim's, so as to experience the pain alongside it. While pursuing a chosen victim, an eremite utilizes its supernatural abilities to distract and distress a given target before it captures and drags it back to the Plane of Shadow via plane shift. Bargaining with an eremite is not usually an option, though if a particularly powerful victim can offer an eremite advice or aid, or otherwise assist in harvesting an even more interesting catch, an eremite can sometimes be convinced to let the helpful victim escape. It's worth remembering, though, that kytons as a whole have little patience for the petty pursuits of honor and pride, seeing such feelings as traits that ultimately spell the end for baser creatures. The only thing that matters to an eremite is the testing of its boundaries as well as the boundaries of existence itself. Just because an eremite might be convinced to let someone go in trade for an opportunity for a greater catch doesn't mean that once that other target is secured the eremite will cease its attempts to capture and harvest its original target. One who manages to distract and subsequently escape an eremite is well-advised to spend the rest of his life on the run. A typical eremite stands approximately 7 feet tall and weighs about 200 pounds. While their general form is something of a humanoid shape, exact appearances can vary wildly between eremites as they harvest and graft particularly unusual pieces of flesh to their bodies from increasingly exotic victims. EREMITE OVERLORDS Eremites who surpass the limits of individuality and achieve dominion over a certain realm of the Plane of Shadow are referred to as eremite overlords. An overlord has focused on a specific type of mutilation, and has taken that heinous surgical procedure to the outer limits of pain and pleasure. Those who worship and venerate the overlords often seek to emulate their patron's chosen mutilation, often fatally so. Overlords keep in correspondence with one another and sometimes collaborate in a Covenant of Overlords, and while they do not view each other as enemies, they are by no means allies, and often vie for the favor of the demagogues. Each overlord is a unique Large (or larger) eremite with several additional Hit Dice. In addition, each has a unique power linked to its chosen form of self-mutilation, as well as 4-6 additional spell-like abilities along that mutilation's theme. For example, an overlord that has perfected the act of skinning itself and wrapping its flesh in thorny black vines might have an ability to send those thorny vines out at great length to grapple and constrict distant foes, and might gain black tentacles, entangle, wall of thorns, and 1-3 similar spell-like abilities.</Description>

    <Description>Interlocutors are the self-proclaimed surgeon-sculptors among kytons, viewing their practice as more art than medical process. Each victim is a new chance to study the art of pain and sensation through horror-stricken eyes. Their ability to heal the damage they inflict, even to the extent of restoring life to a subject that has only just expired, is perhaps more feared than their eagerness to cut flesh. To an interlocutor's victim, death is a mercy that is rarely offered. Nowhere is the interlocutor's mastery of flesh more apparent than in their bodies, for their apotheosis from mortal into kyton involves the shedding of useless parts down to a tangle of nerves, veins, and various organs. These are then incorporated into bodies made of semi-living metal fashioned from raw shadowstuff harvested in strange reaches of the Plane of Shadow, giving the kyton a terrifying body. Periodically, an arm or other "leftover" limb is retained by the kyton, but only in the same way someone might retain ownership of a treasured piece of jewelry as a keepsake or memento. Some interlocutors retain nothing of their old bodies of flesh save the brain, nerves, and portions of their circulatory system. Interlocutors are 9 feet tall and weigh 800 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Spells A lammasu casts spells as a 7th-level oracle (Advanced Player's Guide 44), but does not gain any other class abilities possessed by an oracle. It ignores all divine focus material components for spells it casts.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Lammasus are protectors of the weak and ever-vigilant champions against evil. These noble creatures dwell in crumbling desert ruins or other remote areas, where they tirelessly fight against the forces of darkness, hoping to defend those they consider lesser races from the evils that often lurk in such places. Although most of these winged sentinels prove wise and knowledgeable about those who would seek to do evil in their lands, many races find lammasus arrogant, dismissive, and patronizing, taking umbrage at their superior attitudes and affectations. Such reactions confuse and sometimes insult these highly honorable creatures, who seek only to do good and aid those weaker than themselves. Lammasus who witness members of other races actively combating evil typically prove more sensitive and address such allies as equals. Should good-aligned creatures prove their skill and overcome any differences of attitude they might have with one of these majestic beings, they find a true and noble ally and an invaluable resource for those hoping to defeat evil. Lammasus are quite parental toward those who join their cause, bringing a lifetime of experience to any struggle. This often makes them stern, but those who know lammasus find them to be extremely caring about those they protect. A lammasu eagerly lays down its own life to protect those in peril if such a sacrifice might win the day. Most lammasus are 8 feet in length and weigh approximately 900 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Puffball (Ex) A fungus leshy can spit a puffball as a standard action. If it hits, this attack deals 1 point of damage (this damage is not modified by Strength) and affects the target struck (but not adjacent targets) with the fungus leshy's spores. The puffball has a range increment of 20 feet. Spores (Ex) A fungus leshy is riddled with molds and spores. Anytime a fungus leshy takes damage, a cloud of spores bursts from its body, forcing all adjacent creatures to make a DC 14 Fortitude save or have their vision reduced to 10 feet for 1 minute. Spending a full-round action to wash one's eyes with water ends this effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Keepers of cavernous mushroom forests and rotting compost pits deep within the swamp, fungus leshys preside over subterranean growth and the rot that fertilizes new life. Among the most alien and monstrous-looking of all leshys, these tiny rot farmers' frightening appearance has more to do with the asymmetrical eeriness intrinsic to molds and fungi than an outward expression of evil. Like all their kin, fungus leshys vary widely in form, often adopting the colors and shapes of the mushrooms and other large fungi common to the areas they tend. Fungus leshys are spawned from realms of underground wonder or the rotting places of the natural world. They perform an important service in the lands they keep, encouraging the growth of fungi, transporting rotting material to fertilize other plants, and making the most use of growth that has died off. Fungus leshys are most active at night and spend the day in the forms of plump fungi amid their ripest compost heaps or fungal glens. Fungus leshys are 2 feet tall and weigh 25 pounds, their spongy interiors full of hollows and fluffy spores. GROWING A FUNGUS LESHY A fungus leshy is usually grown amid the compost of a treant's groves, in dens of mold deep underground, or in eerie hillocks at the heart of dense swamplands.

    <SpecialAbilities>Ensnare (Ex) The seeds and slam attack of a gourd leshy entangle the target in vines for 2d4 rounds unless the target makes a DC 12 Reflex save. The target can attempt to burst these entangling vines before the duration expires with a DC 12 Strength check as a full-round action. The save and burst DCs are Constitution-based. Keepsake (Su) Gourd leshys can pop off the top of their heads and store a single Fine-sized object such as a dagger or potion inside While within the leshy's head, the item is warded by nondetection. In addition, after 24 hours, the item within is cleaned and polished, and, if damaged, repaired as if by a mending spell. Both spell effects have a caster level equal to twice the leshy's Hit Dice (CL 2nd for most gourd leshys). Seed (Ex) A gourd leshy can hurl its seeds as a ranged attack. If it hits, this attack deals 1 point of damage (this damage is not modified by Strength) and affects the target with the gourd leshy's ensnare ability. This attack has a 10-foot range increment.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>With tangles of leafy vines for limbs and a carved gourd for a head, gourd leshys present a rather comical appearance. Intimately connected with the harvest season, gourd leshys see to the health and sustainable harvest of crops, especially vegetables and grains. Superstition and love of rituals run deep in gourd leshys. They do their best to exactly reproduce what worked before with every trivial activity, and change seemingly random details when attempting tasks they previously failed. Gourd leshys collect random odds and ends as good luck charms, ranging from polished stones to bird feathers to tarnished coins. Credulous to a fault, gourd leshys believe nearly anything they hear from those they trust. However, their admittedly hollow heads still hold memories, and a gourd leshy betrayed rarely forgets. As gourd leshys aren't particularly strong, they often fight dirty. One favorite trick is to wait for an enemy to come within striking distance while in gourd form so that they can assume their true form and make a sneak attack in the same round. GROWING A GOURD LESHY Gourd leshys grow best in small vegetable patches or in sunny meadows. Carving eyes and a mouth into a growing gourd leshy's "face" is an important part of the growth ritual, for neglecting to do this robs the gourd leshy of its ability to see or speak. The exact nature and appearance of a gourd leshy's features can vary wildly between individuals.

A seedpod has a range increment of 10 feet and detonates on contact to deal 1 point of bludgeoning damage (this damage is not modified by Strength). Anyone struck by a seedpod must succeed at a DC 11 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Leaf leshys tend to the well-being of trees, whether natural stands or cultivated orchards. In appearance, they have soft, pulpy-looking bodies and wear clothing made of dozens of leaves. Larger leaves cover their shoulders, often giving them the appearance of wearing cloaks, and most adorn their relatively featureless heads with helmets made from pine cones, nuts, or fruit rinds. This leafy layer of clothing functions as masterwork padded armor for a leaf leshy, but not for any other creature. Leaf leshys love to play at war. When not laboring on their trees, they wheedle any companions to engage in mock duels with their twig spears, resorting to private weapon drills when they must. In actual battle, they are much more cautious, sticking to cover and harrying their foes with hit-and-run tactics, as they have a strongly developed sense of self-preservation. GROWING A LEAF LESHY Leaf leshys are usually grown under the shade of fruit or nut trees. To grow a leaf leshy, the maker plants an acorn and pine cone together, then mounds up leaves, sticks, and needles around them. When first born, a leaf leshy has no armor, leafy cape, or weapon, but can construct them from available materials given a day and left to its own devices (no Craft check required).

    <SpecialAbilities>Air Cyst (Su) Seaweed leshys constantly grow small bulbs filled with air. As a move action, they can detach a bulb and give it to another creature. If consumed as a standard action, this air cyst grants water breathing (as the spell) for 10 minutes. Seaweed leshys can have a maximum of four usable air cysts at any one time, and air cysts regrow at a rate of one per 24 hours. Water Jet (Ex) A seaweed leshy can expel a high-pressure jet of water from its mouth to a range of 30 feet. It must make a ranged touch attack to strike a target-if it hits, the blast deals 1 point of bludgeoning damage (this damage is not modified by Strength). In addition, the creature hit must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or be blinded by the water for 1 round. The save DC is Dexterity-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Seaweed leshys usually dwell along coastlines, happily splashing and playing in tide pools, but they are equally at home at sea, floating among large kelp beds. Although perfectly capable of existing out of water indefinitely, seaweed leshys prefer to limit their time away from the sea almost out of a sense of pride. Most seaweed leshys take a dim view of freshwater plant life, to the point of mocking such plants in the same way an urbanite might talk down to folk who live in more rural areas. Rumors of freshwater leshys are a sure way to bring peals of mocking laughter from a seaweed leshy. Seaweed leshys resemble miniature, waterlogged green humans grown from leafy green seaweed, with skinny arms and legs, webbed hands and feet, and long strands of brown, green, or red seaweed for hair. They wear armor made from a pair of large clam shells or from several smaller shells tied together. This armor functions as a suit of masterwork padded armor for a seaweed leshy, but not for any other creature. Patient and thoughtful by inclination (save for matters associated with those silly freshwater leshys), seaweed leshys believe that in time nature brings what is needed by the ebb and flow of the tide or the steady flow of the river. They counsel against hasty decisions and rash actions, always preferring to wait and see what another day might bring. GROWING A SEAWEED LESHY Seaweed leshys must be grown in seawater. The leshy's maker plants a strand of kelp or other seaweed in the water and treats it daily with bone ash to encourage algal growth. When first created, a seaweed leshy has no armor, but can construct it from available materials given a day and left to its own devices (no Craft check required).

    <SpecialAbilities>Breath Weapon (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a cairn linnorm can expel a 60-foot cone of acidic bile, dealing 18d8 points of acid damage to all creatures struck. In addition, this bile is infused with negative energy, and inflicts 1d4 negative levels on all creatures struck by it. A successful DC 28 Reflex save halves the damage and completely negates the negative levels. The save DC is Constitution-based. Death Curse (Su) Curse of Decay: save Will DC 28; effect the creature takes 1 point of Constitution damage per day, and ages at an accelerated rate of 1 year per day, eventually incurring all of the penalties of old age but none of the benefits (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 169). Poison (Ex) Bite-injury; save Fort DC 28; frequency 1/round for 10 rounds; effect 4d6 acid damage and 1d6 Con drain; cure 2 consecutive saves.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Cairn linnorms prefer to dwell in necropolises, amid reaches of burial mounds, or in caverns below the scorched earth of legendary battlefields. These linnorms particularly relish the flavor of undead flesh-while they cannot consume incorporeal undead, regions they haunt are typically barren of corporeal undead not canny enough to avoid the cairn linnorm's ravenous appetite. An incredibly powerful undead creature might use a cairn linnorm as a guardian, manipulating the dragon while it selects a cairn or tomb well within the linnorm's territory. While cairn linnorms will not hesitate to feed on undead creatures they encounter, some ancient superstition shared by all of their kind prevents them from actually entering a tomb or other enclosed burial site unless granted permission by the tomb's undead denizens or a priest devoted to the religion associated with the site. Likewise, a cairn linnorm somehow caught within a tomb large enough to contain it prefers not to leave without securing similar permission to do so. These limitations are purely psychological, and if pressed (such as by an enemy seeking to use a tomb entrance as a defense), a cairn linnorm can break such restrictions. A cairn linnorm is 60 feet long and weighs 12,000 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Breath Weapon (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a fjord linnorm can expel a 120-foot line of icy fluid, dealing 16d8 points of cold damage to all creatures struck (Reflex DC 27 for half damage). The freezing liquid quickly hardens to sheets of ice, causing any creature that takes damage to move at only half its normal speed for 1d4 rounds. A DC 27 Strength check made as a full-round action allows a character to break free of the ice before this duration expires. The save DC and Strength check DC are Constitution-based. Death Curse (Su) Curse of Drowning: save Will DC 26; effect creature can never gain the benefit of water breathing, and if it possesses this ability, loses it as long as it suffers the curse. In addition, the creature can hold its breath only half as long as normal, and whenever the cursed creature holds its breath, it functions as if sickened. Poison (Ex) Bite-injury; save Fort DC 27; frequency 1/round for 10 rounds; effect 3d6 cold damage and 1d6 Con drain; cure 2 consecutive saves.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Fjord linnorms dwell among the deep waters that grace northern coastlines where fingers of land create complex rivulets, venturing out to sea to feed on sharks and whales when they cannot find settlements or traveling caravans to savage. As their favored haunts often overlap with coastal trade routes, regions known to be within the territory of a fjord linnorm are often avoided by ships. Fjord linnorms are not particularly adept at capsizing ships, as are some other large aquatic monsters, but one might argue that such tactics are unnecessary for a creature the size and power of a fjord linnorm in the first place. Both the curse and poison of a fjord linnorm are extremely dangerous for those who frequent the waterways of the north. The fjord linnorm's curse is particularly devastating to aquatic creatures, and such beings are careful to avoid any possible conflict with such linnorms. A fjord linnorm is 60 feet long and weighs just over 10,000 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Breath Weapon (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a taiga linnorm can expel a 60-foot cone of electrified vapor, dealing 21d8 points of electricity damage to all creatures struck (Reflex DC 30 for half). The vapor itself persists for 1d4 rounds, filling its cone-shaped area with electrified mist that deals 4d6 points of electricity damage (no save) to any creature that ends its turn in the mist. The mist does not hinder vision. The save DC is Constitution-based. Death Curse (Su) Curse of Electrocution: save Will DC 29; effect the creature gains vulnerability to electricity. Poison (Ex) Bite-injury; save Fort DC 30; frequency 1/round for 10 rounds; effect 4d6 electricity damage and 1d8 Dex drain; cure 3 consecutive saves. Spines (Ex) Any creature that makes a melee attack against a taiga linnorm takes 1d6 points of piercing damage per attack from the linnorm's spines. A melee weapon with reach provides protection from these spines.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>A beast covered with hundreds of spines, the taiga linnorm is a terror to all those who venture through the arctic forests of the north. Taiga linnorms take down foes and prey first with their electrifying breath and finish their victims off with their devastating bite. In winter, when light is sparse and the nights are long, it is easy for a taiga linnorm to blend in with the coniferous forests it dwells in, hiding among the trees and ambushing imprudent travelers or unwary adventurers setting up camp. A taiga linnorm often lies in wait for days- sometimes weeks-just for the opportunity to maim and devour unsuspecting victims. When this subtler tactic does not work, a taiga linnorm simply rampages through the woods in order to find nearby settlements to pillage, taking twisted delight in shocking the inhabitants before shredding them with its massive jaws or destructive forelimbs. In any event, taiga linnorms rarely venture far from their woodland territories save for short flights to attack outlying villages. A taiga linnorm is 50 feet long and weighs just over 13,000 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Breath Weapon (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a tor linnorm can expel a 60- foot cone of flame and ash, dealing 24d8 points of fire damage to all creatures struck (Reflex DC 33 for half damage). One round after this breath weapon is used, the area affected by the attack becomes covered in a cloud of thick, scorching smoke that burns both the lungs and eyes, dealing an additional 8d8 points of fire damage to all creatures in the area. Each creature that begins its turn in the smoke-covered area and breathes must make a DC 33 (+ 1 per previous check) Fortitude save each round or spend that round choking and coughing. Creatures that keep their eyes open for more than 1 round while in the area of the smoke must make a DC 33 Fortitude save or go blind for 1d3 hours. The smoke dissipates after 2d4 rounds. This duration is halved in strong winds and quartered in more powerful winds. The save DC is Constitution-based. Death Curse (Su) Curse of Boiling Blood: save Will DC 31; effect creature gains vulnerability to fire and is permanently staggered from the pain of its boiling blood. The save DC is Charisma-based. Lava Affinity (Ex) A tor linnorm can breathe and swim while submerged in lava and magma. Poison (Ex) Bite-injury; save Fort DC 33; frequency 1/round for 10 rounds; effect 8d6 fire damage and 1d8 Con drain; cure 3 consecutive saves.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Tor linnorms epitomize the raw and untempered power of their kin. They dwell in the tallest volcanic mountains, either in naturally formed caverns or in the craters themselves, and rain destruction down upon nearby mountain villages whenever the urge strikes them. Tor linnorms are brutes, but as far as linnorms go are relatively intelligent. With this intelligence comes an overwhelming vanity-unlike other linnorms, tor linnorms enjoy being adored and worshiped by lesser creatures, and have been known to delay eating prisoners who seem to be particularly cowed by their presence, simply basking in their victims' fear. A tor linnorm is 50 feet long and weighs 15,000 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Expert Climber (Ex) A gecko's feet allow it to climb virtually any surface, no matter how slick or sheer. In effect, geckos are treated as constantly being under a natural version of the spell spider climb.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>These lizards are mostly docile and shy away from attacking creatures larger than a cat or dog. Despite their shyness, they are ultimately curious creatures, and often approach bigger creatures simply to investigate. Of course, a giant gecko is more than capable of defending itself, biting creatures that react violently to the lizard when fleeing is not an option. Some humanoids train giant geckos as bestial guardians. Smaller humanoids (in particular, goblins) can even use the creatures as mounts, taking advantage of their superior climbing skills to attack from seemingly impossible positions and angles. A giant gecko measures 8 feet from nose to tail and weighs 120 pounds. Coloration among giant geckos can vary wildly, though most are some shade of green.

    <SpecialAbilities>Damage Reduction (Ex) A lukwata's damage reduction is penetrated only by nonmagical weapons (temporary magical weapons, such as those created by the spell magic weapon and similar effects, count as magical weapons). Digest Magic (Su) A magic item swallowed by a lukwata must make a DC 22 Fortitude save after an hour or become permanently nonmagical. Artifacts are immune to this effect. The save DC is Constitution-based. Dispelling Bite (Su) When a lukwata scores a critical hit with its bite, the victim is affected as if targeted by a greater dispel magic spell. The caster level for this effect is equal to the lukwata's Hit Dice (CL 14th for most lukwatas). Eldritch Encrustation (Su) Crystalline growths along the lukwata's digestive tract contain large deposits of magical energy. These nodes are responsible for the magical feedback that surrounds each lukwata, granting it its spell resistance, damage reduction, dispelling bite, and digest magic abilities. Dispel magic cast on a lukwata can negate these powers for 1 minute-the CL of the effect is treated as the lukwata's Hit Dice (CL 11th for most lukwatas).</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Lukwatas slip through dark tropical waters, preying upon all who dare enter their deep jungle rivers and pools, including beasts typically considered apex predators. While scholars say the beasts favor the dark, light doesn't deter them in their relentless pursuit of prey. Their long, flat bodies are reminiscent of those of dolphins or large fish, but lukwatas' heads are distinctively eel-like. A lukwata's unusual ability to disrupt magical effects rises from the strange crystalline growths that line its throat and stomach-crystals that allow the lukwata to gain nutrients from magical items as efficiently as from flesh and blood. These same growths give the lukwata an unusually strong resistance to all manner of magic attacks. Lukwatas hate crocodiles, their chief predatory rivals, and attack them on sight, even if the lukwata has recently fed. Most crocodilians are not large enough to pose a significant threat; however, some accounts exist of lukwatas and dire crocodiles crossing paths. These fights are renowned for inf licting great destruction, with the embattled creatures smashing to bits piers, flotillas, and even dams in their fury. A lukwata is 20 feet long and weighs 4,000 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Paired Weapons (Ex) Because of its intense training wielding a scimitar in each hand, a maftet's off-hand scimitar is treated as a light weapon. Raptor Dive (Ex) When airborne, a maftet can swoop down and strike at lightning speed. This is equivalent to an aerial charge, but it must move downward at least 10 feet and may dive at twice its normal flying speed. Doing so grants the maftet a +2 bonus on its attack rolls and allows it to make a full attack at the end of the raptor dive. Runic Tattoos (Su) The tattoos scribed on a maftet's body power its spell-like abilities and glow when those abilities are used. A maftet can activate up to two of its spell-like abilities as a standard action. It may make a Fortitude save to resist the effects of an erase spell cast on its tattoos, but if it fails, it loses access to its spell-like abilities for 24 hours.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Dwelling in crumbling ruins and lost cities, maftets are a race of winged feline humanoids. Accomplished hunters and stalkers, maftets are highly skilled in fighting with dual scimitars. A typical maftet is 7 feet tall and weighs 270 pounds. The fur on their leonine bodies ranges in coloration from a light buff to goldenrod or rust red. In some climates, maftets have the spotted lower bodies of leopards, and in rare circumstances they may possess white fur and pale skin or black fur and grayish-purple skin. Such individuals frequently rise to positions of power among their kind. At home in dry deserts and mountains, maftets prefer to lair in abandoned ruins, mysteriously drawn to such desolate places. They also make do with dens in cliff-side caves or mountaintop eyries, but only if no suitable abandoned edifices can be found. When a young maftet comes of age, it receives its runic tattoos from a shaman, usually the eldest female in the pride. The art and magic of creating these tattoos has been passed down from mother to daughter for thousands of years, along with the race's oral history and legends. Their origins now lost to history, these tattoos are always the same (with minor cosmetic variations between the sexes and between different prides) and always have the same effects. Under no circumstances are these tattoos ever given to non-maftets.</Description>

    <Source>PFRPG Bestiary 3</Source>
    <IsTemplate>0</IsTemplate>
    <SpecialAbilities>Heated Flesh (Ex) Any metal weapon striking a magmin must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or melt and gain the broken condition. Another strike by the same weapon causes the metal weapon to be destroyed if it fails a second save. Wood weapons are destroyed after only one failed save. Unarmed and natural attacks made against the magmin deal 1 point of fire damage to the attacker. The save DC is Constitution-based. Searing Aura (Ex) A magmin radiates extremely high temperatures, and any creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of a magmin must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of fire damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>While magmins populate the Plane of Fire, they sometimes slip through elemental rifts into the Material Plane. These rifts usually occur in places of searing heat, such as volcanoes or underground rivers of magma, or in places of strong, unpredictable magic. The latter scenario usually results in more problematic entrances, as magmins tend to accidently set fire to any nearby flammable objects. Though not courageous, these small outsiders still make formidable foes against any creature without resistance to their intense heat. Their touch incinerates clothing, and creatures that strike their bodies with steel run the risk of reducing their weapons to slag. Magmins' best defense in their homes on the Plane of Fire is in their sheer numbers. Their settlements, dotted with magma pools and leaping geysers of molten rock, teem with staggering numbers of the creatures. Magmins are paranoid and untrusting. Always fearful of the larger denizens of the Plane of Fire, magmins harangue any interlopers with dozens of questions, asking where they are going, where they came from, and what they are doing near the magmins' precious magma pools. If travelers' answers are unsatisfactory, the magmins try to shuffle the creatures off as quickly as possible. Those who refuse to leave risk being thrown into a pool of liquid rock. Magmins take great pride in the cultivation of their magma pools. Each magma pool has a different purpose, such as bathing, cooking meals, or relaxation. Magmins add minerals and salts to these pools to properly season them for their intended uses. Cooking pools (sometimes called "murder pools" by strangers) burn hotter than most others, and relaxation pools are generally darker than bathing pools. Upon reaching adulthood, magmins stand 4 feet tall, their dense compositions giving them a weight of 300 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Separate (Su) During the day, a manananggal looks like a living human woman. She does not detect as undead during the day, but is still an undead creature. At night, her upper torso rips away (this is a full round action that occurs at sunset), leaving her lower torso behind. Her lower torso is helpless, but her upper torso gains its fly speed and natural attacks at this time. The upper and lower portions share the same pool of hit points (despite any intervening distance), and if the helpless lower portion is damaged, the manananggal is immediately aware of the attack. Since manananggals can be destroyed by damage to their lower bodies, they prefer to hide their lower torsos when separated. A manananggal must return to its lower torso and reattach to it (a full-round action) within the hour before sunrise-each round a manananggal remains separated after sunrise, it takes 1d6 points of damage until it rejoins its lower torso or it crumbles into dust. Vulnerable to Light Blades (Ex): Light blades (such as daggers, kamas, kukris, rapiers, short swords, sickles, and starknives) deal double the weapon's base damage on a successful hit against a manananggal.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Horrid undead, manananggals walk among the living by day and prey upon them at night. These creatures delight in spreading fear and distrust. By day, they tend to stay inside because of their light sensitivity. They mask this odd behavior by either living just outside villages as reclusive hermits or by obtaining roles within the community that explain away or justify their eccentricities. Manananggals pass themselves off as normal people, usually posing as mad old women, midwives, hedge witches, or mystics. This allows the undead creatures to select their prey from within the community. Manananggals particularly enjoy feeding upon pregnant women, targeting them in their sleep so the undead may feast on the blood of both mothers and the children they carry. These foul creatures drain blood via their long, black, hollow tongues. Manananggals despise the scent of garlic and strong spices like cloves and anise. As they fly through the night, manananggals make a ticking or clicking sound, leading some villagers to call the creatures "tik-tiks." Once separated, a manananggal's mobile torso has a 6-foot wingspan.</Description>

    <Description>These strange-looking animals have long pointy ears and pronounced muzzles, and their strong legs carry them about in amazing leaps. Like all marsupials, kangaroos give birth to live young ("joeys") that are relatively undeveloped at birth and completely helpless, and must remain within a protective pouch on the mother's belly for months before safely emerging. While not particularly dangerous, a kangaroo is more than capable of defending itself if cornered or when forced to protect its young, striking out at foes with a powerful kick capable of knocking unwary antagonists off their feet. A kangaroo stands over 6-1/2 feet tall and weighs upward of 200 pounds. To represent a smaller species standing about 4 feet tall and weighing 110 pounds, apply the young simple template or manually reduce the size from Medium to Small. Kangaroos reach maturity in less than a year and can live up to 20 years, but most individuals in the wild are hunted by predators within their first decade.

    <Description>An ancient relative of the smaller leatherback sea turtle, the archelon can grow up to 13 feet long and 16 feet from flipper to flipper. Weighing as much as 5,000 pounds, the archelon has an exceedingly powerful bite, and doesn't hesitate to use it to deter aquatic nuisances. Like other sea turtles, female archelons come ashore to lay and bury their eggs in sandy beaches, preferably facing deep water and without coral reefs. Once done, they return to the sea, leaving their eggs defenseless. These creatures are often used by coastal tribes as guardians and escorts from island to island. Aquatic creatures, particularly locathah, often use them as beasts of burden, but their relatively slow swim speed makes them poor mounts.

    <Description>The immense baluchitherium stands nearly 18 feet high at the shoulder, measures 30 feet from end to end, and weighs 40,000 pounds. Despite its size, it lives a peaceful life pulling leaves from the tops of trees unless startled into action. When panicked, a baluchitherium tramples any obstacle in its path. If confronted, it smashes its tormentors with its elephantine feet. A properly trained baluchitherium makes a capable mount for ettins, ogres, smaller giants, or other Large humanoids, and is one of the few mammals other than an elephant able to fill that role. Its relatively ponderous pace limits its usefulness to some extent, but its strength often more than makes up for this shortcoming.

    <Description>Despite their saurian name, basilosauruses are in fact oceanic mammals, and at 60 feet in length are highly formidable beasts of the sea. In appearance, they resemble greatly elongated whales, but with long, toothed jaws resembling an alligator's. Inexperienced observers often confuse a basilosaurus with a sea serpent or water orm- and in all fairness, in the aftermath of a basilosaurus attack on an unsuspecting ship, such distinctions are largely academic anyway. A basilosaurus relies as much on vision as echolocation to find prey, but sometimes mistakes smaller ships for food. Basilosauruses have few natural predators; only supernatural monsters like krakens, thalassic behemoths, and the largest of sea serpents can truly threaten a fully grown one.

    <SpecialAbilities>Swamp Stride (Ex) A mobogo can move through any sort of natural difficult terrain at its normal speed while within a swamp. Magically altered terrain affects it normally. Tongue (Ex) A mobogo's tongue is a primary attack with reach equal to three times the mobogo's normal reach (45 feet for a typical mobogo). A mobogo does not gain the grappled condition when using its tongue to grapple a foe. Vile Croak (Su) As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, a mobogo can unleash a thunderous croak. Any non-boggard or non-mobogo within 50 feet of the mobogo must make a DC 19 Will save or become staggered for 1d4 rounds. Once a creature makes its saving throw against a particular mobogo's vile croak, it is immune to that mobogo's croak for 24 hours. Any boggards or mobogos within the area of a mobogo's vile croak gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls and saving throws against fear effects for 1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Huge and hungry, mobogos merge the features of gigantic toads and swampy dragons, and lair in the deepest, oldest swamps. Here, whole tribes of boggards serve the beasts' fickle, capricious whims. Mobogos reside in the most primal swamps of the world, grotesque eldritch wildernesses unchanged for centuries. Boggards believe that in ancient times, after their fecund demon goddess deposited her frogspawn in the muddy morass of the world's still-forming continents, mobogos were among the first creatures to emerge. Ever since, the mobogos have slept and fed, preying upon the beasts of their fetid meres, growing huge and lethargic, and dreaming inscrutable amphibious dreams of their godly mother's return. Nearly all mobogos are attended by tribes of boggards. Mobogos care little for matters of origins and philosophies-they care only for the endless sacrifices of food, victims, and pleasing swamp art brought to them by their obedient tribes. A mobogo is 18 feet tall and weighs 12,000 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Wisdom Drain (Su) A creature that takes rend damage from a moon-beast must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or take 1d4 points of Wisdom drain. A moon-beast heals 5 points of damage for each point of Wisdom it drains in this manner. If it drains a victim to 0 Wisdom, the moon-beast gains the effects of a heal spell. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Moon-beasts have no voice or eyes, yet they "see" more than most and can project their thoughts into the very minds of those they wish to communicate with. These monstrosities hail not from any physical moon, but rather from the shared satellite of all slumbering minds in the Dimension of Dream beyond the wall of sleep. Here, the moon-beasts raise stone cities on the oily shores of night-black seas found upon the dark side of the dreaming moon, from which they launch long, dark galleys crewed by not-quite-human slaves that sail through the void of space down to the seas of the Dimension of Dream to seek new slaves and stranger, more sinister wares. Moon-beasts are slavers, first and foremost. They use their spell-like abilities to curb rebellion or to quickly gain minions, but much prefer using physical and mental regimens of torment and reconditioning to break the spirit of their captives. They often work with the denizens of Leng, a metaphysically nearby dimension of nightmare and madness, although as often as not these planar neighbors serve the moon-beasts merely as slaves. Worshipers of ageless entities from beyond the stars, moon-beasts are often compelled to travel to the Material Plane for strange and frightening causes, not the least of which is gathering suitable sacrifices for their mysterious and demanding lords. A moon-beast is 9 feet long and weighs 800 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Disease (Su) Purple Pox: inhaled or injury; save Fort DC 15; onset 1 minute; frequency 1/day; effect 1d2 Wis and 1d2 Con damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. A creature that dies of the purple pox becomes bloated over the course of 24 hours, after which its body bursts open, releasing a fully grown myceloid. Additionally, as long as a creature takes at least 7 points of Wisdom damage from the purple pox, it must make a DC 15 Will save each day to avoid becoming affected by a lesser geas (no HD limit) that compels the sickly character to seek out the nearest myceloid colony in order to offer itself up for spore domination. The save DCs are Constitution-based. Spore Cloud (Ex) Once per day as a standard action, a myceloid can expel a 10-foot-radius burst of spores centered on itself. This cloud persists for 1d3 rounds. Any creature caught in this cloud or that moves through it is exposed to the myceloid's purple pox disease-a creature need save only once against any one spore cloud, however, before becoming permanently immune to that particular spore cloud's effects. The spore cloud does not hamper vision. Spore Domination (Sp) This spell-like ability functions as charm monster, but functions only against creatures currently infected with purple pox.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The walking fungi known as myceloids feed off of decaying organic matter like many other fungi, yet unlike typical mushrooms or molds, they take particular pleasure in feeding from the rotting bodies of humanoids. Myceloids claim to be able to taste things like "innocence," "despair," and "hope" in the ripeness of rancid meat, although whether this is true or simply part of the myceloids' twisted sense of humor is unclear. Most myceloids have deep purple caps studded with white lumps, and paler purple necks and bodies of tough, leathery fungus. Their spores grow tenaciously in living flesh, causing a rapid spread of painful purple lesions that, in advanced stages of the sickness, sprout tiny purple mushrooms; plucking these mushrooms is painful to the victim and causes bleeding. This condition, known as purple pox, is the method by which myceloids both season their meat and procreate. Myceloids prefer to capture victims alive for later infection and control. To a myceloid, a living creature has three uses-first as a slave, second as a host from which to birth new myceloids, and finally as a banquet to feast upon once the first two destinies have played out</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Hypnosis (Su) Once per day, by weaving and coiling its body and hissing as a standard action, a lunar naga can cause its scales to shimmer and glow with moonlike radiance. All creatures within 30 feet must make a DC 17 Will save to avoid becoming fascinated. The lunar naga can maintain this fascination effect as long as it concentrates; fascinated creatures follow the still-glowing naga if it moves as long as it maintains the effect by concentrating. The save DC is Charisma-based. Poison (Ex) Bite-injury; save Fort DC 18; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3 Con and 1 Wis; cure 1 save. Spells A lunar naga casts spells as a 5th-level sorcerer.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Lunar nagas are patient watchers of the night sky. They enjoy cosmology and believe strongly in astrology, maintaining a handful of complex zodiacs. A few lunar nagas even bear knowledge of the unspeakable things from the dark spaces between the stars. A lunar naga stretches over 10 feet from its pale face to the tip of its tail, and weighs close to 200 pounds. Nocturnal creatures, lunar nagas often live in ruined towers or atop mountains-any place open to the sky at night. There they peer through astrological devices, closely monitoring passing celestial markers, eager to decipher more of the universe. Those living underground make nightly trips to the open sky when they can. Cloudy nights make lunar nagas agitated, and a creature is more likely to run afoul of a lunar naga on these dark evenings. Lunar nagas sometimes lead small cults of sky-watchers. These followers aid the nagas in recording tome upon tome of calculations of the stars and planets moving through the inky black of the night sky. In small doses tempered with water, fruit juices, and alcohol, lunar naga venom is mildly hallucinogenic. The nagas' cultist allies often take the substance as a ritualistic drug.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Change Shape (Su) A royal naga can use this ability to take one of five specific humanoid forms. Each of these forms has a unique appearance (such as a female dwarf with red hair, an elderly male human, and so on) and the naga can only use this ability to assume these five forms. The naga can still use its dual gaze in humanoid form. Dual Gaze (Su) A royal naga has a piercing stare capable of crippling those that meet its gazes. The creature has two gaze attacks and can switch between them as a move action. One gaze causes those that succumb to it to become permanently blinded, while the other causes those that succumb to be permanently deafened. A DC 21 Fortitude save negates the effects of either gaze; otherwise, the effects are permanent until cured. Royal nagas generally prefer to keep their deafening gaze active, switching to the blindness gaze once combat begins and some of their foes have already been deafened, since those who are blinded can no longer be harmed by gaze attacks. The save DC is Charisma-based. Spells A royal naga casts spells as a 9th-level sorcerer.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Regal and proud, royal nagas haunt lost cities and forgotten kingdoms, guarding ancient treasures for their own inscrutable reasons. A royal naga's five faces are sharp and fierce, taking on a terrifying countenance when it becomes angered. Bespeaking their innate pride and vanity, royal nagas adorn their serpentine hoods and faces with elaborate and valuable piercings, crowns, or other precious accessories. Royal nagas are 18 feet long, and often weigh more than 750 pounds. Royal nagas tend to be stern in nature and commanding in speech. Although naturally sociable, they are distrustful of strangers and seem to have great difficulty speaking to other creatures as equals.</Description>

    <Description>With mottled scales of blue and green, water nagas' serpentine beauty belies their deadliness. Although doubtlessly intelligent, these nagas have more in common with normal snakes than most of their kind, preferring to be left to their own devices and lashing out at any creatures that would disturb them. A typical water naga measures 10 feet long and weighs 250 pounds. Where many nagas claim particular lairs as their homes, water nagas typically have a number of retreats, migrating from one to the next with the changing of the seasons. These nagas keep elaborate summer and winter lairs, with several favored shelters positioned between these so they can make a circuit of familiar rivers and coasts throughout the year. Fiercely territorial when it comes to their lairs, water nagas typically attack any that intrude upon their sanctuaries, only bothering to question interlopers once such creatures have been weakened by poison, if at all. As their yearly treks make many water nagas especially well traveled, those who live near the serpents' lairs- usually lizardfolk, fey, and human tribes-often court the snake creatures' good graces with offerings of rich local delicacies, hoping to learn of nearby lands and pass on their own stories to distant neighbors. Enjoying flattery, exciting tales, and the adoration of those they see as lesser creatures, most water nagas take pride in their roles as travelers. However, while rarely malicious, they quickly grow bored of repetitive, mundane anecdotes and often embellish the stories they've heard with their own fictions-caring little for the repercussions such misleading tales might cause for their listeners. The congeniality of some water nagas does not extend to the entire race, and many unwary souls, even those with only the best intentions, face these serpentine creatures' deadly bite.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Crushing Blow (Ex) When a nephilim makes a successful critical hit with a melee attack, the target must make a DC 22 Fortitude save or take an additional 3d6 points of nonlethal damage and be staggered for 1 round. The save DC is Strength-based. Mortal Challenge (Su) When a nephilim spends a standard action to roar a battle challenge, all humanoids and monstrous humanoids within 100 feet of the nephilim must make a DC 18 Will save to avoid becoming frightened for 5d6 rounds. On a successful save, the creatures only become shaken for that time. Creatures with more HD than the nephilim become shaken if they fail their save, and suffer no effect if they succeed. A creature that succeeds at the save is immune to that nephilim's mortal challenge for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. Soul of Sorrow (Ex) A nephilim gains a +2 bonus on Will saves against fear effects and any effect that causes sorrow.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The nephilim are the offspring of demigods who bred with humans. This joining resulted in a race of giant-sized beings possessed of a shard of divine power and the mortal consciousness of humans. A nephilim stands 11 feet tall and weighs 1,100 pounds. Its divine heritage grants it a lifespan of almost 600 years. Nephilim are a nomadic, secretive race. This isolationism has only heightened the wild tales surrounding them, making it even harder for other races to trust them. While the ancient animosity humans once had against them has been largely forgotten, zealots occasionally try to mount pogroms and crusades to wipe the nephilim out forever. The nephilim have proven strikingly resistant to these efforts.</Description>

    <Description>Nixies are guardians of ponds, rivers, lakes, and springs. They prefer dwelling in idyllic places, which they protect from the depredations of predators and careless humanoids. While this often involves confusing enemies and driving foes away, nixies are not afraid of spilling blood to protect their homes-though they prefer not to resort to such means unless completely necessary. Nixies are 4 feet tall and rarely weigh more than 45 pounds. Nixies avoid combat if possible, using charm person to lead humanoids away from their lairs. They sometimes use this ability to enslave people to act as protectors or help with a task that is simply too big for them to deal with. They cast water breathing on charmed creatures helping with tasks below the surface. Nixies are reclusive and prefer to keep their presence hidden. They make lairs underwater, forming small communities if their numbers are great enough. Legends speak of a secret nixie kingdom at the bottom of a great lake, but no one has yet confirmed its location. BOG NIXIES In some lands, nixies are evil creatures who lead folk to drown in their waters, either by captivating their targets with song or by assuming the form of an animal or humanoid and tricking a hunter or explorer into dangerous waters. These evil nixies prefer dwelling in festering swamps or blighted fens, and are typically known as bog nixies. The fact that a bog nixie can grant minor wishes, ironically, only increases their opportunities for evil, as brave or foolish explorers deliberately seek them out. A bog nixie is a neutral evil nixie with the advanced creature template who has the following additional powers. A bog nixie's CR is +2 higher than a normal nixie's. Captivating Song (Su): This works like the harpy ability of the same name. The save DC is Charisma-based. Change Shape (Su): This works as polymorph, and allows the bog nixie to assume the form of any Small or Medium aquatic animal or humanoid. Minor Wish (Sp): Once per day, a bog nixie can create a magical effect in exchange for a gift or service from a humanoid. The power of this "wish" is no greater than what can be done with a 3rd-level spell.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Fated (Su) A norn adds her Charisma modifier as an insight bonus to AC and on initiative checks. Shears (Su) A norn's shears function as a +5 mithral keen speed scimitar, but only for a norn. Shift Fate (Su) As an immediate action, a norn can force any one target within 120 feet to reroll a saving throw-this ability must be used immediately after the saving throw is rolled, and the target must abide by the result of this second roll. Snip Thread (Su) As a standard action up to three times per day but no more often than once every 1d4 rounds, a norn may produce a golden thread linked to a creature's fate and then attempt to snip it short with her shears. The target creature must be within 120 feet and in the norn's line of sight. The target immediately takes 20d6 points of damage (Fortitude DC 30 for half). If the target dies from this damage, the norn has cut through the thread-in this case, the target may only be restored to life via miracle, wish, or divine intervention. This is a death effect. The Save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Ancient beyond imagining, the norns are a race of powerful women who hold in their hands the physical manifestation of fate and destiny in the form of golden thread. They watch over all life, intervening with reluctance when called upon or with a vengeance when the strands of fate are twisted and abused by lesser beings. Worshiped as gods by some, the norns do little to discourage this veneration. A norn stands 14 feet tall and weighs 800 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Breath Weapon (Su) A nuckelavee's breath weapon is a cone of withering foulness that causes painful welts, cramps, and bleeding, and only harms living creatures- this damage bypasses all energy resistance and damage reduction. Non-creature plants in the area are affected as if by a blight spell. Any creature that fails its Reflex save against the breath weapon must make a DC 21 Fortitude save or contract mortasheen (see below). The save DC is Constitution-based. Disease (Su) Mortasheen: Contact; save Fort DC 21; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Con and target is fatigued; cure 2 consecutive saves. Animals take a -2 penalty on their saves against this disease. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The dreaded nuckelavee is a manifestation of pollution and filth, be it the natural decay of a red tide or the intrusive pollution of sewage and other urban waste. A nuckelavee is a living irony-a carrier of disease and a spreader of corruption that unleashes its wrath against other sources that bring corruption into the world. The corruption spread by nuckelavees only serves to further their own sense of self-loathing and overall rage. While nuckelavees might, incidentally, carry out vengeance for the victims of such pollution, defending the denizens of their rivers, swamps, and bogs is not their primary drive, for they revel in inf licting the very corruption they hate and enjoy little more than watching their enemies sicken and die. Folktales tell of talismans to carry-fetishes of seaweed garlands, horsehair soaked in brine, or vials of sanctified seawater-or of prayers to recite to ward away nuckelavees or convince them the bearer is innocent. In truth, however, these old solutions offer no protection from the vile plague-bearers. A nuckelavee is the same size as a horse.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Cloud Form (Su) A nue can change into the form of a 10-foot black cloud or back to its normal form as a standard action. A nue in cloud form is otherwise treated as if under the effects of gaseous form, except that it obscures vision like fog cloud. Poison (Ex) Bite-injury; save Fort DC 21; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Strength damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>This strange creature has the body of a tiger, the head of a fanged monkey, and a poisonous viper for a tail. Though some call it a chimera and treat it as an exotic specimen of that creature, it is a completely different breed of beast. Intelligent enough to enjoy cruelty as well as inf licting terror upon its prey, a nue delights in toying with its victim before dealing the killing blow. Often, a nue will select a target and plague it with nightmares before it even attempts an act of violence, wearing down the victim with dreadful dreams and phantasmagoric terrors. Once its prey is thoroughly exhausted, the nue will finally steal into the victim's sleeping chambers and engage in combat, paralyzing its target with its magic and infecting its prey with both disease and poison, letting the victim writhe in pain before succumbing to death. A nue's ghastly appearance in physical form is only made eerier by its ability to turn into an inky cloud of darkness. In this guise, a nue can hide amongst fog clouds or shadows before emerging as the destructive horror it is. By the time a nue crawls forth from the inscrutable black cloud, its prey is often too fatigued from its strange night terrors to defend itself. The dreams a nue impregnates creatures' minds with varies from victim to victim, but all share the trait of an ever-present, foreboding cloud that exudes a fierce and palpable sense of malice. Some legends suggest that nues are the spirits of children warped into twisted forms to spread paranoia, exhaustion, and fear among former friends and family. According to these stories, such a cursed child wreaks terror upon its friends and relatives until they are all either dead or driven mad by fear. Then, the creature moves on, seeking more challenging kills to sate its vicious hunger. The greatest joy a nue can feel is snuffing the life of a once-strong and proud target that has been brought low by its debilitating attacks. A nue is 9 feet long and weighs 600 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Fiery Missile (Su) As a swift action, a fire yai can launch a bolt of fire from its third eye. This attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment. Smoke Form (Sp) As a standard action, a fire yai can turn into a cloud of smoke. This functions like gaseous form, except the cloud has the properties of the smoke cloud from a pyrotechnics spell (Fort DC 26 negates the effects of the smoke cloud). The fire yai can end this ability as a standard action.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Fire yai prefer to live in luxury-an orderly and well-built abode is essential. Even a lone fire yai prefers to build or inhabit a fortified stone dwelling in its territory, and surrounds itself with as many luxuries as it can acquire. Vain, greedy, and brutal, fire yai are the most impulsive of their kind-several tales tell of clever heroes taunting fire yai to act rashly. They rarely let challenges pass uncontested and react quickly to squelch any threat to their rule. While many fire yai seek out tribes of fire giants to infiltrate and rule, not all follow this compulsion. Capable of assuming the form of many types of humanoid, some fire yai seek to subtly invade and eventually rule entire nations of humanoids from within. A fire yai is 16 feet tall and weighs 7,000 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Icy Missile (Su) As a swift action, the ice yai can fire a dart of ice from its third eye. This dart is a ranged touch attack (+20 attack bonus), dealing 4d6 points of cold damage on a hit. This attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment. Staggering Strikes (Ex) An ice yai can strike twice per round with its two slam attacks. A creature struck by more than two of these slam attacks in a round must make a DC 28 Fortitude save or be staggered for 1 round. The save DC is Strength-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The ice yai is a sinister creature that combines the brutality of a frost giant with the grace and style of a skilled martial artist. Although its magical powers are formidable, it prefers to fight in melee using its slam attacks, leading its minions in merciless combat. It uses its mobility to cast combat spells or launch shards of ice from its third eye. An ice yai is a natural leader among frost giants, tempering their savagery with its own wisdom. A tribe led by an ice yai may still raid settlements of neighboring humanoids, but the tribe soon learns the value of establishing regular tributes and willing sacrifices-the ice yai teach that methods that rely upon the threat of violence are often even more effective than actual violence. Despite this strangely enlightened philosophy, an ice yai never passes up an opportunity to reinforce its capacity for slaughter, and will often demand that its subjects take part in show battles, both for the entertainment of the tribe and to nurture the ice yai's insatiable ego and sense of dominion over its subjects.</Description>

    <Description>While the majority of oni tend to be larger than life, and thus often end up having associations with giants and other enormous humanoids, not all of them are born into physical bodies that match their boundless appetites for cruelty. The kuwa are an example of this, for they are oni who clothe themselves in human flesh. While their true forms remain unmistakably fiendish, with golden skin, claws, and monstrous visages with short sharp horns, kuwa are most at home living in disguise among humans. As with most oni, they generally avoid their own kind, and instead seek positions of power in human cities, often as guard captains, guildmasters (particularly of thieves' guilds), and aristocrats. Most kuwa avoid taking on the role of a spellcaster unless they possess class levels in an appropriate class. Likewise, all but the most ambitious kuwa avoid positions of true authority, such as king or mayor. Kuwa are most comfortable in the upper echelon of command, but avoid positions so important that they have too many eyes on them. To a kuwa, a position of leadership that doesn't allow frequent abuse of that power is a waste, and by aiming for less publicly visible positions, the kuwa increases its opportunities for such abuse. Once a kuwa secures a position in a human society, the accumulation of wealth becomes its primary motivation. A kuwa wants to live a life of decadence and sensual pleasure, and like any oni, it wants to propagate its own kind. Its strength and magical powers enable it to easily dominate normal folk, allowing it to gather groups of thuggish, like-minded humans to lead in banditry and worse. A typical kuwa stands about 6 feet in height and weighs 190 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Mask Symbiosis (Ex) A spirit oni can be worn as a mask by a willing Small or Medium creature. While worn in this way, the wearer can see through the oni's eyes and speak through its mouth, although the wearer retains its own senses and voice. The spirit oni remains a separate creature, and must detach from its host's face (as a move action) if it wishes to take any action of its own (including attacking or using a spell-like ability). While a spirit oni is worn as a mask, it grants a +2 insight bonus on its host's Perception checks. Poison (Ex) Gore-injury; save Fort DC 12; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Cha; cure 2 consecutive saves.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Most oni that emerge on the Material Plane do so into a new body of humanoid flesh, yet this is not the case for all oni. Periodically, when an evil spellcaster wishes to engage the servitude of an oni as a familiar, the result is something relatively unusual-an oni made flesh directly from its spiritual form rather than one who takes the features of a humanoid as its own. Any lawful evil 7th-level spellcaster who takes the Improved Familiar feat can gain a spirit oni as a familiar. The ritual to gain such a familiar requires the spellcaster to craft a particularly fiendish and fierce-looking oni mask-this does not require a Craft check or any additional expenditure of gold, and is assumed to be part of the overall ritual for securing the familiar. When the ritual is complete a raw oni spirit is lured into the mask, which immediately transforms it into the animate, living creature presented here. While the ritual binds the oni to its new master, it also robs the oni of its immediate chance to achieve a human form. As a result, spirit oni are foul-tempered and cantankerous creatures, even to their masters. They must be regularly reprimanded and disciplined, lest their jealousy and bitterness get the better of them. When a spirit oni's master dies, the spirit oni gains free will and the ability to make its own choices-but the spirit oni's innate cowardice and dishonor usually prevents it from taking its own life in hopes of returning to true spirit form and then returning as a proper oni. Rather than extinguishing themselves, such masterless spirit oni seek out more powerful oni and offer their services to their superiors, in hopes that they might someday be granted a promotion from their lowly state to something more bef itting their egos and desires.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Commanding Voice (Su) A void oni gains a +4 racial bonus on the save DC of any charm or compulsion effects it uses against humanoids. Void Form (Su) A void yai may become incorporeal as a swift action. In this form, it appears as a solid black shadow of its true form. It gains the incorporeal subtype and incorporeal defensive ability while in void form. Any gear or armor the yai carries becomes incorporeal as well-it loses its AC bonus from armor and natural armor, but gains a deflection bonus to its AC equal to its Charisma modifier (+7 for most void yai, for an AC of 16). It may still speak while incorporeal and can still use its spell-like and special abilities. Void Missile (Su) As a swift action, a void yai can launch a bolt of darkness from its third eye. Damage caused by this missile is negative energy damage. This attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment. Void Trap (Su) When a void oni uses any teleportation effect on itself (including its greater teleport and plane shift spell-like abilities, but not its teleport object spell-like ability), it can choose to arrive at its destination in void form as a free action. When it does so, it leaves behind a temporary lesser sphere of annihilation in a square of its choice that was part of its space before it teleported. This sphere of annihilation cannot be caused to move by other creatures, but the sphere itself moves at a fly speed of 30 feet (perfect) toward the closest Tiny or larger creature on the oni's next turn. If no appropriate creature is within 30 feet, the sphere does not move that round. If the sphere enters a square occupied by a creature (or if a creature touches the sphere), that creature is affected as if by a disintegrate spell (CL 20th, DC 23). Once the sphere damages a creature with this effect, the sphere vanishes-it also vanishes on its own after 24 hours in the unlikely event that it never discharges on a creature. The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The concept of the void is a difficult one for many individuals to grasp, for it encompasses more than just an absence of anything. The concept of "void" as an element also represents the heavens above, the dark places between the stars, the nature of the spiritual world, and even the capacity to create and envision new ideas. The void yai represents all of these possibilities, interpreted in a way that exemplifies the evil of the oni race. Unlike lesser oni, the void yai does not represent any single humanoid race-the closest it comes is perhaps the rune giant, and certainly the void yai superficially resembles monsters of legend, with its dark, heavily muscled body, horns, and fangs. A void yai manifests when the combination of an extremely powerful oni spirt and an overwhelmingly evil location intersect at precisely the right time. Rarely, an eldritch transformation spontaneously elevates an existing yai to the vaunted status of void yai-whispers of vile rituals that an oni can perform to quicken this transformation keep some sages awake at night, for if such rituals existed, then all oni could potentially become void yai-a sobering thought indeed, given the void yai's daunting capacity for cruelty. As with almost all oni, the void oni's use of weapons and armor seems like cruel overkill. A void oni is 20 feet tall and weighs 10,000 pounds. Void yai turn toward the Material Plane to satisfy their desires, lording over lesser creatures with the aid of the void. A void yai usually claims a huge territory, bringing much larger creatures to heel as servants. As with fire yai, a void yai makes frequent use of lesser oni as its minions, but prefers to surround itself with whatever giant tribe or society it has conquered. Rarely, a void yai commands kingdoms of smaller humanoids, but since the immense void yai has no ability to assume the shape of such small and insignificant creatures, it often feels awkward and out of place. More so than other yai, void yai are ashamed of their true appearance-their vanity is such that most are masters of using their change shape ability to appear as breathtakingly handsome or beautiful giants, and it is in this form they prefer to live. Only when combat begins does their rage take control, causing them to revert to their true, horrific shapes. VOIDLORDS Between the considerable power of the typical void yai and the divine might of the oni daimyos exists a middling category of unique void yai. But to even use the term "middling" in this context is something of a folly, for these unique void yai, known collectively as the voidlords, are among the most powerful creatures to walk the Material Plane. While void yai typically content themselves with ruling nations, voidlords arrive with a greater mission-to control entire worlds and bring all that dwell upon these worlds to their knees. Voidlords are always void yai with additional racial Hit Dice or class levels-levels of fighter, monk, and rogue are favorite choices for voidlords. These powerful outsiders generally eschew spellcasting classes under the opinion that might and the oni's inborn supernatural abilities are a greater path to conquest than mortal magic. In addition to having the typical void yai abilities, each voidlord possesses an additional number of powers keyed to that voidlord's particular area of focus. Two sample voidlord foci are listed below, but these represent only a tiny fraction of the total possible. Martial Arts: A voidlord of martial arts always attacks with unarmed strikes-it is treated as a 20th-level monk with the flurry of blows ability for the purposes of determining its damage and number of attacks per round with its unarmed strikes. This voidlord gains Stunning Fist as a bonus feat, and gains the use of the following spell-like abilities three times per day: forceful hand, grasping hand, and greater shout. Swordplay: A voidlord of sword fighting always carries a sword of some sort-typically a katana. These voidlords gain the ability to use the following spell-like abilities three times per day: blade barrier, keen edge, and mage's sword. They are automatically proficient in the use of swords, and any sword they wield is treated as a +5 weapon, in addition to any other magical qualities the weapon might have. A voidlord of swordplay can also permanently transform any magic weapon (save for artifacts) into a sword of any size or type by touch.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Acidic Missile (Su) As a swift action, a water yai can launch a bolt of acid from its third eye. Any creature struck by this bolt must also make a DC 29 Fortitude save to avoid becoming nauseated for 1 round by the overwhelming stench of the acid. This attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment. The save DC is Constitution-based. Flowing Robes (Su) A water yai wears a special silk kimono infused with magical water. This kimono grants a +6 armor bonus. These robes function as armor only for water yai. Liquid Form (Sp) As a standard action, a water yai can turn into a mobile pool of water. This functions like gaseous form, except that the yai cannot fly in this form. It retains its own base speed, and its swim speed doubles to 120 feet. The water yai can end this ability as a standard action.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The water yai clad themselves in the flesh of storm giants, yet these yai are more at home dwelling beneath the waves than they are above them. Unlike most oni, water yai have no real longing to rule or infiltrate societies- yet they still enjoy posing as humanoids. They often assume the forms of enormous merfolk in the water, but prefer to adopt the shapes of storm giants when on land. The water yai then pursues its favorite decadence-the acclimation of material wealth and luxuries. Water yai tend to be easily distracted by beautiful treasures, and despite their evil natures are prone to acts of unexpected frivolity.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Animal Telepathy (Su) A giant owl can telepathically communicate with other animals as if under the effects of speak with animals. Insightful Senses (Su) A giant owl's senses are particularly well honed to sensing danger or locating prey. It adds its Wisdom modifier as an insight bonus (+3 for most giant owls) on its initiative checks. Piercing Stare (Su) Up to three times per day as a swift action, a giant owl can gain the effects of true seeing (as the spell) for 1 round.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The noble giant owl roosts in the tallest trees or in high caves near its forest home. No mere animals, giant owls pride themselves as intellectuals and keen judges of character. Little passes a giant owl's notice in its home forest. What it doesn't observe directly, it learns from its wide network of animal informants. Giant owls view themselves more as watchers than participants, rarely interfering in the affairs of others barring a threat to their homes. Giant owls stand 18 feet tall and have 30-foot wingspans, yet they rarely weigh over 600 pounds.</Description>

    <Description>Though great horned owls seem large, most of their apparent bulk comes from their particularly fluffy feathers and rather large heads. Great horned owls have wingspans of up to 5 feet and weigh up to 4 pounds. Great horned owls primarily hunt at night, locating prey through their excellent hearing. Their diet consists of rodents supplemented by smaller birds and rabbits.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Pistols (Su) A pale stranger fights with two pistols. A pistol has a range increment of 20 feet and deals both bludgeoning and piercing damage. At a range of up to 20 feet, a pale stranger's pistol attacks resolve as touch attacks. While pistols normally consume bullets and black powder when fired, a pale stranger's pistols supernaturally reload the instant it fires them, allowing the undead to make multiple attacks in a round with the weapons. In addition, any pistol a pale stranger wields functions as a +1 pistol. A pale stranger does not provoke attacks of opportunity when it fires a pistol in melee, and treats pistols as light weapons for the purposes of determining penalties from two-weapon fighting. Further rules for pistols, and firearms in general, can be found in Ultimate Combat. Stranger's Luck (Su) A pale stranger gains a +3 luck bonus to AC and has no chance of misfire when using firearms. Stranger's Shot (Ex) As a full-round action, a pale stranger can take careful aim with one of its firearms and take a single, ruinous shot. This single shot always resolves as a touch attack, regardless of the actual range. If the pale stranger threatens a critical hit with this shot, it automatically confirms the critical hit. Regardless of whether the shot is a critical hit or not, it deals +6d6 points of damage.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Sometimes death itself cannot come between a gunslinger and its final revenge. When a gunslinger is slain by a hated enemy, or murdered before it can achieve vengeance against a hated foe, the anger and wrath can animate its remains as a vengeful undead monstrosity. When a pale stranger first rises, it seeks out the source of its anger to finish the job-thereafter, it wanders the desolate parts of the world looking for new victims to vent its unending rage upon. A pale stranger appears much as it did in life, though desiccated and obviously undead. Rare pale strangers have the ability to hide their undead nature and appear as they did in life using veil as a constant spell-like ability (CL equals their CR). These pale strangers are often more powerful and have class levels in gunslinger or ranger, and often attract large groups of adoring bandits and followers who may or may not realize that their murderous idol is in fact an unliving horror. A pale stranger stands 6-1/2 feet tall and weighs 130 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Infestation (Ex) Any living creature that takes damage from a rot grub swarm becomes infested unless it succeeds at a DC 19 Reflex save. On a failed save, the infested creature takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage per round as the rot grubs burrow through and consume its flesh-this effect continues as long as the victim remains in the swarm and continues for 1d6 rounds after it leaves the swarm. Any energy-based attack (including damage from negative energy) that deals at least 5 points of damage to the victim automatically destroys all of the rot grubs infesting it, ending the effect prematurely. Additionally, any effect that removes disease instantly ends a rot grub infestation. Immunity to disease offers no defense. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Rot grubs are foul, nauseating parasites that feed on flesh and use corpses as nests in which to grow. While a rot grub can derive nourishment from dead flesh, its true hunger is for the flesh of the living. Thankfully, rot grub swarms occur only rarely, as they require the infested carcass of a Huge or larger creature and many weeks to build up the numbers necessary to constitute a swarm. In some cases, a rot grub continues to feed and grow, eventually reaching enormous size as a giant rot grub.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Hexes A penanggalen witch can use one of her hexes at will on any creature within 30 feet. Using a hex is a standard action (unless otherwise noted) that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Save DCs are Intelligence-based. Cackle Hex (Su) As a move action, the penanggalen may cackle. Any creature within 30 feet that is under the effects of the penanggalen's evil eye or misfortune hex has the duration of that hex extended by 1 round. Evil Eye Hex (Su) This hex causes the target creature to take a -2 penalty on one of the following (penanggalen's choice): AC, ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, or skill checks. This effect lasts for 6 rounds, or only 1 round if the target succeeds at a DC 15 Will save. This is a mind-affecting effect. Misfortune Hex (Su) This hex causes a creature to suffer grave misfortune for 1 round. Whenever the target makes an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check during this time, it must roll twice and take the worse result. A DC 15 Will save negates this effect. A creature may only be targeted by this hex once per day.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The hideous penanggalen is one of the most horrific vampiric monstrosities. By day, a penanggalen appears to be a normal humanoid, but at night or when provoked, the creature's head rips free from the rest of her body, coils of viscera and entrails dangling from her throat as she launches into the air, seeking blood to sate her unholy thirst. Unlike most undead, the penanggalen is more akin to the lich in that she willfully abandons both her mortality and morality to become a hideous undead monster. While penanggalens are traditionally female spellcasters, any creature capable of performing the vile ritual of transformation can become one. Similar to a lich, a creature works toward becoming a penanggalen. More than one such transformation ritual exists, but all require heinous acts that symbolize the casting aside of kindness, benevolence, and any semblance of feelings other than cruelty. Many of these rituals call for the repeated consumption of blood, bile, tears, and other fluids drawn from captured and tortured innocents. A penanggalen keeps a vat of vinegar in her lair. When returning from a night of feeding, a penanggalen's organs are swollen with blood. In order to fit back into her body, the penanggalen must soak for 1 hour in this vat of vinegar. Once reduced, a penanggalen slides back into her body. If a penanggalen is slain away from her body, the body rapidly deteriorates into foul-smelling grit. The penanggalen presented above was a witch in life. The witch class is presented in full in the Advanced Player's Guide. CREATING A PENANGGALEN "Penanggalen" is an acquired template that can be added to any living creature with 5 or more Hit Dice (referred to hereafter as the base creature). Most penanggalens were once humanoids or monstrous humanoids and nearly every penanggalen is female. A penanggalen uses the base creature's stats and abilities except as noted here. CR: Same as base creature +1. Alignment: Any evil. Type: The creature's type changes to undead (augmented). Do not recalculate class Hit Dice, BAB, or saves. Senses: A penanggalen gains darkvision 60 ft. Armor Class: Natural armor improves by +6. Hit Dice: Change the base creature's racial HD to d8s. All HD derived from class levels remain unchanged. As undead, a penanggalen uses her Charisma modifier to determine bonus hit points (instead of Constitution). Defensive Abilities: A penanggalen gains channel resistance +4, DR 5/silver and slashing, resistance to cold 10 and fire 10, and all of the defensive abilities granted by the undead type. A penanggalen also gains fast healing 5. Weaknesses: A penanggalen gains light sensitivity. In addition, a penanggalen is staggered while outside of her human body and exposed to direct sunlight. Speed: When a penanggalen is attached to her body, she retains the same base speed as the base creature. When a penanggalen is separated from her body, she has only a fly speed of 60 feet with good maneuverability. Melee: A penanggalen gains a bite attack and a slam attack when she is detached from her body. Damage is standard for attacks of these types for the penanggalen's size. Both natural attacks are treated as magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Special Attacks: A penanggalen retains all of the base creature's special attacks. She also gains the following additional special attacks. Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 the penanggalen's HD + the penanggalen's Charisma modifier unless otherwise noted. Blood Drain (Su): A penanggalen's blood drain special attack causes 1d4 Constitution damage. Create Spawn (Su): When a penanggalen slays a female humanoid via blood drain, and if that slain humanoid had at least 10 Hit Dice in life, that slain humanoid rises as a manananggal at the next sunset. This manananggal is under the command of the penanggalen who created it, and remains enslaved until that penanggalen's destruction. A penanggalen may have enslaved spawn totalling no more than twice its own Hit Dice; any spawn it creates that would exceed this limit become free-willed undead. Disease (Su): Any creature a penanggalen bites is exposed to filth fever-the save DC against this disease is set by the penanggalen, not the disease itself. Wither (Su): A penanggalen's entrails drip with a foul bile that blisters and weakens living flesh. Any creature that is damaged by a penanggalen's slam attack must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d4 Dexterity and 1d4 Charisma damage. Ability Scores: Str +6, Dex +4, Int +2, Wis +2, Cha +4. As an undead creature, a penanggalen has no Constitution score. Skills: A penanggalen gains a +8 racial bonus on Bluff, Fly, Knowledge (arcana), Perception, Sense Motive, and Stealth checks. Special Qualities: A penanggalen gains the following special quality. Separate (Su): During the day, a penanggalen has the same appearance as she did in life, and does not detect as undead (though she is still an undead creature). At night, she can detach her head and entrails as a full-round action. Her physical but now hollow body exists as dead flesh, but can be destroyed if it suffers damage equal to the penanggalen's normal hit point total. Before a penanggalen can return to her body, she must soak her entrails in vinegar for 1 hour-she can then reattach to her body, at which point any damage done to the body immediately heals (although damage the penanggalen herself suffered remains). A penanggalen whose body is destroyed can never again walk the day in living form, but is otherwise unharmed (save for no longer having a safe way to travel in direct sunlight). When a penanggalen wears her body, she cannot use her natural attacks, her fly speed, or any of her special penanggalen attacks.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Flame Jump (Sp) A peri can enter any fire equal to the peri's size or larger and travel any distance to another fire in a single round, regardless of the distance between the two. This ability otherwise functions as greater teleport (caster level 14th), but the peri can transport only itself and up to 50 pounds of objects. Smoke Sight (Su) A peri can see through fire, fog, and smoke without penalty. Whirlwind Dance (Su) Once per day as a full-round action, a peri can spin in an ever-faster, whirling dance, transforming itself into a spinning vortex of flame 10 to 40 feet high for up to 9 rounds. This ability functions as the whirlwind ability (DC 26 Reflex save), but any creature that comes in contact with the whirlwind or is caught inside it takes 2d6+6 points of fire damage and is subject to the peri's burn special attack. The save DC is Dexterity-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Peris are a race of celestials native to the good-aligned Outer Planes, but they are also often found in the company of mortals on the Material Plane. Believed to be the descendants of fallen angels, peris do penance for their ancestors' sins before they can earn a place in paradise. As a result, peris work tirelessly to aid and support good heroes of the mortal realms in a never-ending battle against evil. Peris hate the evil fiends known as divs, who constantly seek to ruin the good works of mortals. Peris often work to repair damage wrought by the destructive divs. For their part, the divs take great pleasure in tormenting and persecuting peris, locking the fiery-winged celestials in cages of cold iron and endlessly torturing them.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Phantom Flesh (Su) As a move action, a phantom fungus can turn invisible as if using greater invisibility (caster level 4th). A moment after it attacks with invisibility, the creature appears briefly as a semi-transparent version of its normal self. This allows any viewer with line of sight to the phantom fungus to pinpoint its location at the time of the attack (though if the creature moves after it attacks, opponents have to pinpoint it again). An opponent can ready an action to strike at the fungus when it momentarily appears, in which case the creature only has concealment instead of invisibility (20% miss chance). The fungus can turn completely visible as a move action, though it normally remains invisible all the time. If killed while invisible, it becomes visible 1d4 minutes later.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>A phantom fungus is a tripedal carnivorous plant that roams the vast and deep underground caverns of the world. It wanders in search of food, using its rootlike feet to detect movement along the cavern floors and the sensitive tendrils surrounding its mouth to pinpoint prey. its ability to vanish from sight. Stealthily patrolling the perimeters of caverns, a phantom fungus remains invisible until it is behind its prey, at which point it snaps at its victim with its vicious maw. A phantom fungus prefers to ambush lone creatures. When it encounters a larger group, a phantom fungus often stalks prey for hours, waiting for the targets to spread out or make camp so that it may attack a single foe at its leisure. Though phantom fungi are not normally pack hunters, there are reports of groves working together to bring down larger foes. When faced with no other option than to attack multiple foes, a group of phantom fungi focuses its attacks on single targets. They prefer to attack noisier foes if possible-characters wearing heavy armor or those that make heavy use of loud attacks (such as bards or spellcasters) are preferred over quieter creatures. The maw with which a phantom fungus attacks prey is lined with row upon row of sharp, jagged teeth that resemble pointed rocks more than actual fangs. This "mouth" is not used to feed, however, and does not attach to a digestive tract-it is nothing more than a gaping natural weapon. When a phantom fungus feeds, it does so by squatting down on its prey and infesting the corpse with thousands of feeding filaments that burrow through dead flesh to siphon away nutrients. A typical phantom fungus is 6 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds. Although they prefer dwelling underground, they have been encountered above ground as well.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Magnetic Pulse (Su) A plasma ooze is surrounded by an aura of magnetism that allows it to attract metallic objects and creatures. At the start of the ooze's turn as a free action, the ooze makes a combat maneuver check against all metallic creatures, all creatures wearing metal armor, and all creatures wielding metal weapons within 30 feet. If it beats the CMD of a metal or armored creature with this check, that creature is pulled 10 feet closer to the ooze and cannot move away from the ooze for 1 round. If this causes the creature to move into a square occupied by the plasma ooze, the ooze can attempt to engulf that creature as a free action. If it beats the CMD of a creature wielding a metal weapon, that weapon is disarmed and pulled 10 feet closer to the ooze. Unattended metal objects of size Large or smaller are automatically pulled toward a plasma ooze. This magnetism is supernatural in nature and affects all metal objects. Plasma Ray (Su) As a standard action, a plasma ooze can fire 1d4 plasma rays at up to 4 separate targets within 60 feet (no more than one ray can attack a single creature). Each ray deals 4d6 points of electricity damage and 4d6 points of fire damage on a hit.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Massive and devastating, plasma oozes are mysterious, extraterrestrial beings made of superheated electromagnetic sludge. While their origin is not fully known, it is widely accepted that plasma oozes are not from this world. Some scholars believe they dwell in the sun, while others maintain they hail from the Plane of Fire. That plasma oozes have been encountered in both of these locations does little to help solve the debate. A plasma ooze flies by somehow interacting with gravity and magnetic waves, drifting through the air in a manner similar to the way a jellyfish swims in water. This creature's only real purpose is to consume, and it prefers to do so by drawing prey into its fiery, electrified core. Scholars find it curious that while a plasma ooze can only attract and repel metallic substances, the thing can only digest organic matter, and rather slowly at that. Survivors of plasma ooze attacks are rare, but such victims describe the pain of being struck by one's rays as like being pulled apart piece by piece. Wounds left by a plasma ooze's touch resemble hideously melted burn scars. A plasma ooze is 20 feet in diameter and weighs 6,000 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Change Shape (Su) A popobala loses its frightful presence, popobala fever, and stench abilities when not in its true form. Harvester of Sorrow (Su) A popobala heals as a result of the suffering of others. It gains fast healing 10 if at least one creature within 15 feet has one or more of the following conditions: confused, cowering, dying, exhausted, fatigued, frightened, nauseated, panicked, shaken, sickened, staggered, or stunned. Horrid Haunting (Su) A popobala may use ghost sound or ventriloquism as a free action whenever it manipulates a creature or object with animate objects, dominate person, or telekinesis. The ghost sound or ventriloquism originates from the controlled object or creature. Popobala Fever (Su) A creature wounded by a popobala's talons becomes sickened for 1d6 minutes unless it makes a DC 25 Fortitude save. A creature already sickened by the fever becomes nauseated for 1d6 rounds. One already nauseated by the fever is helpless for 1d6 rounds. This is a disease effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The popobala is a much-feared shapeshifter that haunts and hunts warm coastal lands, roaming night and day to terrorize and spread anarchy and unrest while slaking its insatiable twin urges for violence and prurience. Shifting freely between bat, human, and its natural form, the popobala is most dreaded for its mesmeric charms, but it is more than capable of engaging in savage bloodletting against those who anger it. Popobalas are attracted to chaos, anarchy, and unrest, as the intensity of emotions and uncertainty inf lames its already fierce urges. War, changes of government, and religious or ethnic strife or persecution-all of these excite a popobala, and if a society remains too settled and stable, the beast is never above fomenting unrest through its own predations. A typical popobala is 5 feet tall with a 12 foot wingspan. It weighs only 100 pounds.</Description>

    <Description>Porcupines are omnivorous mammals that often climb trees in search of food. The spines on their back provide camouflage as well as protection from natural predators- typically other small mammals. Though primarily nocturnal, porcupines do occasionally graze during the day, eating the twigs, roots, and stems of bushes, coniferous trees, and other flora. Porcupine quills normally lie flat against the creature's body, but stand stiff ly on end when the porcupine feels threatened.</Description>

A creature that grapples a giant porcupine takes 2d4 points of piercing damage each round it does so.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>More so than its smaller kin, the human-sized giant porcupine is a foul-tempered creature that is just as content chewing on carrion as on living creatures. Worse, giant porcupines are notorious in their almost foolhardy bravery, and have been known to attack creatures much larger than their own size. This unexpected aggression, when combined with their tangle of spearlike quills, makes the giant porcupine a dangerous foe.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Spawn Undead (Su) Any creature slain by a pukwudgie's poisonous quills rises in 24 hours as a zombie. Undead created by this ability are not immediately under the control of a pukwudgie, but they receive a -4 penalty on saves against a pukwudgie's control undead spell-like ability. Poison (Su) Quill-injury; save Fort DC 18; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3 Con damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based. Quills (Ex) A pukwudgie can fire two of its quills as a ranged attack as a standard action. These quills have a range increment of 40 feet. Any creature attacking a pukwudgie with light or one-handed melee weapons, natural weapons, or an unarmed strike takes 1d3 points of piercing damage. A creature that grapples a pukwudgie takes 2d4 points of piercing damage. Anyone who takes damage from these quills is also exposed to the pukwudgie's poison.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The vile pukwudgie is a small, hunchbacked humanoid covered with long, sharp quills. These quills, like those of a porcupine, help protect the small creature but are also dangerous offensive weapons, for the quills hold a deadly poison that animates those it slays as zombies. This necromantic nature, along with their penchant for torment and sadistic ways, makes pukwudgies evil to the core. A pukwudgie stands 3-1/2 feet tall and weighs a little more than 30 pounds. Pukwudgies are frequently found in the company of undead. This retinue usually consists of zombies and skeletons created via their poisonous quills ability or their ability to animate dead bodies. They have a strong preference for animating the bodies of dead animals over other creatures, and often use undead animals as mounts. A pukwudgie usually stays away from well-traveled areas and humanoid settlements, but may sometimes slip into small villages in the night to steal children. The little horrors enjoy the tender flesh of newborn babies immensely, and are often willing to go through great personal risk to secure infantile repasts when they are available. Their delight in arson only further makes them a bane of small villages.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Spells A dandasuka casts arcane spells as a 2nd-level sorcerer.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Dandasukas, also known as "biters" among rakshasas, serve as spies and assassins. They often appear as part of a rakshasa's retinue or secret network. Born to manipulate and murder, they revel in their work and delight in the sight of blood. Thus, dandasukas go about their work cheerfully, laughing as they manipulate foes and butcher victims. All dandasukas are restless and energetic. They crave activity and entertainment, preferring the sick and cruel to conventional fare. Dandasuka pranks are rarely amusing for the victim. Monstrous hunger gnaws at the hyperactive dandasuka's body, making the creature crave humanoid flesh and blood. When such blood is spilled, a dandasuka is often not able to contain its fiendish appetite. It might lick a bloody blade, lap up fallen drops, or even take a bite out of a fallen foe at the expense of a more tactically sound option in a fight. A dandasuka settles for other meat when it must, but it always prefers humanoid flesh. Murder and mayhem are not the only duties of a dandasuka. Stronger rakshasas dispatch dandasukas as emissaries and servants to allies. Despite their usual disorderly habits, they bargain good-naturedly and in good faith, only implying dire consequences for noncompliance. Dandasuka negotiators efficiently take care of impasses if no favorable resolution can be reached. Similarly, dandasuka retainers serving rakshasa allies curb their fiendish ways as best they can, though their employers would still do well to keep them amused and fed. One has to be careful of keeping dandasukas too pleased, however, since they are known to take unwanted initiative because of off-hand remarks, such as idle wishes that a certain person were dead. Dandasuka greed extends from amusements and food to wealth. All dandasukas love comfort, fine clothing, and shiny baubles. Most of them wear as much jewelry as they possibly can without looking ridiculous, and some cross that line. A dandasuka is 3 feet tall and weighs 55 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Extra Initiative (Su) When an encounter starts, a maharaja rolls twice for initiative. The maharaja acts normally on the higher of the two initiative counts each round. On the lower initiative count, the maharaja can take a single standard action. Spells A maharaja casts arcane spells as an 18th-level sorcerer.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>All rakshasas aspire to power, but there are those for whom this hunger is more than an obsession: It's a birthright. Legends among the rakshasas tell of the maharajas-those rakshasas whose depredations and acts of cruelty have elevated them above others of their kind and allowed them to reincarnate as embodiments of every myth, fable, and cautionary tale involving the beast-headed fiends. Accorded the respect and deference of their lessers, maharajas inspire one emotion within the rakshasa race that few can: fear. A maharaja rakshasa emerges only after a rakshasa of great power and inf luence has spent several lives as a member of the samrata, the height of the rakshasa's social-spiritual caste system. When a rakshasa ascends to maharaja status, others of its kind take notice, with rakshasas coming from far and wide to serve even a young maharaja-eager to curry its favor at an early age. The birth of a maharaja denotes that great change is imminent: The maharaja will fulfill some terrible destiny, found a lasting nation of rakshasas, undergo some manner of divine ascension, or defeat some greater foe and commandeer its domain, often splitting the region into large enough chunks for its lieutenants and servants to claim and still have room to expand. It is rare in the extreme for more than a handful of maharajas to emerge in the same century. So great is a maharaja's power and inf luence and so long is its life that one can spend most of its time enjoying the luxury of its years of toil. When not manipulating armies or the machinations of lesser rakshasas, it can often be found surrounded by the most beautiful of its servitors-often charmed or dominated humanoids, or, if the maharaja is powerful enough, good-aligned outsiders-lounging in opulence. The lair of a maharaja is typically a glorious, decadent mansion. After decades or centuries of work, gold filigree decorates the columns, and great friezes embossed with rakshasa myths and folklore decorate the walls. Rather than couches or divans, luxurious pillows stuffed with exotic feathers and crafted from the hides of even rarer creatures serve for furniture, and all about hang the trophies of a centuries-long life of tyranny: the crowns of defeated rulers, the wealth of ruined countries, and the heads of failed lieutenants. A maharaja's great experience and power, however, does not make it immune to or ignorant of threats. Disloyal servants, powerful kings, ambitious rivals, and meddling adventurers all might step forth to challenge a maharaja's rule. To that end, a maharaja employs devious methods to ensure its own safety, with assassination, false rumors, and illusory doubles serving as useful tools to ferret out threats. Wary of attack and often with wide territories to control, most rakshasa maharajas have several secluded palaces and lavish redoubts, and travel among them endlessly. RAKSHASA RAJADHIRAJAS Each maharaja is unique, the process of its evolution granting it strengths and weaknesses that differentiate the being from all before it. Over its lifetimes, its path teaches it myriad lessons and grants distinctive powers. A typical maharaja is a master of divination, enchantment, and illusion. Other maharajas master various other techniques, such as necromancy or conjuration. As a maharaja continues to grow in malignant might, its powers outstrip those even of its peers. It might ultimately ascend to the rank of rajadhiraja-a king of kings. Even more so than the maharajas, the rajadhirajas are unique beings. A rajadhiraja is never lower than CR 21-most have additional racial Hit Dice beyond the standard maharaja. Each additional racial Hit Die granted increases the rakshasa's CR by +1, but also increases its effective sorcerer caster level by +1 and grants a new spell-like ability that follows that rakshasa's personal theme and philosophy. A rajadhiraja that fancies itself a master of space and time might gain the ability to use greater teleport three times per day or the use of time stop once per day, while one who sees itself as a master of forms might gain the ability to use shapechange once per day or polymorph at will. A master of combat might instead gain additional damaging spell-like abilities. The type of new spell-like abilities the rakshasa gains can be selected as needed-8th- and 9th-level spells should be usable once per day, 5th- through 7th-level spells usable three times per day, and spells lower than 5th level at will, though even these guidelines can be adjusted as you see fit to make a more interesting rajadhiraja. The cycle of reincarnation and the faint memories it imparts provide rajadhirajas with the distinct power to manipulate life and death according to this cycle. A rajadhiraja can use its mastery of reincarnation to alter these cycles for other creatures, and as a result, all rajadhirajas gain the following special ability in addition to their other powers. Reincarnate (Su): Once per day as a standard action, a rajadhiraja can bring a dead creature back to life as if using the reincarnate spell, except that the target must have been dead less than 1 day and can have been killed by a death effect. As with any effect that restores life to a creature, the reincarnating creature can choose not to be reincarnated if it wishes, but if it does allow the effect to happen, it returns to life at full capacity, as if restored via true resurrection in a new form. Some rajadhirajas slay their own allies in combat, then use this ability to in order to allow the allies to continue the battle in a new body. The new form granted by this effect can be any form within one size category of the dead creature's original size-the exact form of this new body is chosen by the rajadhiraja. Use the results listed in the Core Rulebook for the reincarnate spell as guidelines for determining the new body's physical ability score adjustments.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Confusion (Su) A creature bitten by a marai's bite (from either its actual mouth or the snakes it has for hands) must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or become confused for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based. Energy Bolts (Ex) Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity, a marai's six snake arms can each spit a bolt of energy to a maximum range of 60 feet. Each bolt deals 1d8 points of damage and has an additional effect if the target fails to resist it with a DC 19 Fortitude save, as summarized below. The save DC is Constitution-based. Amethyst Viper: Cold damage plus sickened for 1d4 rounds. Crimson Viper: Fire damage plus burn (1d4, DC 19). Emerald Viper: Acid damage plus nauseated for 1 round. Magenta Viper: Electricity damage plus staggered for 1 round. Turquoise Viper: Sonic damage plus stunned for 1 round. Violet Viper: Force damage plus knocked prone. Spells A marai casts arcane spells as a 5th-level sorcerer.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Marai are deviant spellcasters first and fiendish corruptors second. If allowed to indulge in their desire for perverse mystical study, most marai are content to serve as part of another rakshasa's cabal. A solitary marai might pose as a neophyte magician to infiltrate another spellcaster's abode. If the marai is successful, the master soon becomes either the servant or a corpse. The possibility of new magical discoveries drives a marai. Morality and compassion never constrain the fiend's experiments. A marai prefers to torment and exploit mortals who have no idea of the rakshasa's true nature, and it takes great pleasure in using magical might to bring would-be heroes, especially those who invade its lair, to their knees. Such a game offers a marai enjoyment, however, only if subjects are unaware of the danger or at least unable to oppose it. A marai is 6 feet tall and weighs 160 pounds. Its serpentine arms render fine manipulation or wielding weapons unfeasible, and so it typically assumes humanoid form when working on experiments that require manual dexterity. A marai unable to do so must rely upon cantrips like mage hand for such tasks-or perhaps the aid of a slave or charmed ally.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Change Shape (Su) As a full-round action, a raktavarna can take the shape of a handheld object, most often an ornamental light, a one-handed weapon, or a piece of treasure. If the rakshasa remains stationary in such a form, it can attempt Stealth checks even while being observed. It can remain motionless in object form indefinitely, but reverts to its true form as soon as it takes any action. Master's Eyes (Su) A raktavarna can designate a single creature as its master as a standard action. If the raktavarna is a spellcaster's familiar, its master is automatically that spellcaster, and the raktavarna cannot change this. As a full-round action, a raktavarna's master can observe the world as if looking through the raktavarna's eyes. The master must concentrate to maintain this link each round. The master's visual senses are suppressed for this time, and he uses the raktavarna's darkvision, detect magic, and regular eyesight to observe the world. This ability has no limit on range, and functions even across planar boundaries. If the raktavarna is slain while its master is using this ability, the master is stunned for 1d4 rounds (no save). Poison (Su) Bite-injury; save Fort DC 13; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Wis plus modify memory; cure 1 save. Each time a victim takes Wisdom damage from this poison, a modify memory effect causes the victim to forget the previous minute's interactions with the raktavarna, as long as the raktavarna is no longer visible or is in object form. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Made up of smoke, blood, and gold, raktavarnas are the least of the rakshasas-they are born not from humanoids, but from the souls of rakshasas who failed utterly in their previous incarnation and who are thus reborn from a serpent's egg. These terrors drift through society, passing from hand to hand as weapons or strange tokens from foreign lands, curiosities brought home by traders and emissaries and given to leaders as tribute. In this manner the raktavarnas gain entry into corridors of power throughout the world, and what they see, their foul masters know. A raktavarna's servitude to a master ends only when its master decrees, or (more commonly) upon the master's death. Little disconcerts raktavarnas more than having no master, and when they are cast adrift in this manner, they seek a replacement as soon as they can. A 7th-level lawful evil spellcaster with the Improved Familiar feat can gain a raktavarna rakshasa as a familiar.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Martial Artist (Su) A tataka's unarmed strikes deal 2d6 points of damage. If a tataka gains monk levels, it uses its tataka unarmed strike damage or its monk unarmed strike damage, whichever is higher. Its unarmed strikes function as lawful and evil weapons for overcoming damage reduction. Spells A tataka casts spells as a 12th-level sorcerer. A tataka can cast spells from the cleric list as well as those normally available to a sorcerer. Cleric spells are considered arcane spells for a tataka.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Tataka rakshasas are the least subtle and largest of their kind. They are philosophers and fanatics, loyal servants of the rakshasa immortals. Their familiarity with religion and its trappings makes them excellent corruptors and blasphemers. Such rakshasas might assault sacred sites or rituals directly so as to foil good works and slay holy people. A tataka holds all religions in contempt save the worship of rakshasas, and it openly mocks and assaults any who dare believe otherwise. Tataka rakshasas are more than zealots, though, and they train from an early age in martial arts-their strikes can break bones as surely as any unarmed strike from a monk or other practitioner of such styles of combat. A typical tataka is 12 feet tall and weighs 1,300 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Swarming (Ex) Ratfolk are used to living and fighting communally, and are adept at swarming foes for their own gain and their foes' detriment. Up to two ratfolk can share the same square at the same time. If two ratfolk in the same square attack the same foe, they are considered to be flanking that foe as if they were in two opposite squares.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Ratfolk are small, rodentlike humanoids often found traveling in nomadic trading caravans or perhaps dwelling in colonies in slums, sewers, and other normally undesirable urban sectors. Tinkerers and hoarders by nature, many ratfolk are shrewd merchants, carefully navigating the shifting alliances of black markets and bazaars. They love their stockpiles of interesting items far more than money, and would rather trade for more baubles to add to their hoards than for mere coins. Ratfolk are extremely communal, and live in large warrens with plenty of hidden crannies in which to stash their hoards or flee in times of danger, gravitating toward subterranean tunnels or tightly packed tenements in city ghettos. They feel an intense bond with their large families and kin networks, as well as with ordinary rodents of all sorts, living in chaotic harmony and fighting fiercely to defend each other when threatened. Ratfolk are generally 4 feet tall and weigh 80 pounds. They often wear robes to conceal their forms in cities, as they know other humanoids find their rodent features distasteful. RATFOLK CHARACTERS Ratfolk are defined by their class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. All ratfolk have the following racial traits. -2 Strength, +2 Dexterity, +2 Intelligence: Ratfolk are agile and clever, yet physically weak. Small: Ratfolk are Small and gain a +1 size bonus to their AC, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, a -1 penalty on CMB and to CMD, and a +4 size bonus on Stealth checks. Darkvision: Ratfolk can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Tinker: Ratfolk gain a +2 bonus on Craft (alchemy), Perception, and Use Magic Device checks. Rodent Empathy: Ratfolk gain a +4 bonus on Handle Animal checks made to inf luence rodents. Swarming: See above. Languages: Ratfolk begin play speaking Common. Ratfolk with high intelligence can choose from any of the following bonus languages: Aklo, Draconic, Dwarven, Gnoll, Gnome, Goblin, Half ling, Orc, and Undercommon</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Beckoning Call (Su) As a standard action, a rusalka can sing or speak, causing all non-fey creatures within a 300-foot spread to approach its position as if compelled to do so via a suggestion spell (DC 27 Will negates). A creature that successfully saves is not subject to the same rusalka's beckoning call for 24 hours. When an affected creature begins its turn adjacent to the rusalka, it is dazed for that round. These effects continue as long as the rusalka takes a standard action to maintain the effect, plus 1 additional round. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. Staggering Touch (Su) A creature touched by a rusalka must make a DC 27 Fortitude save or be staggered for 1 round by overwhelming feelings of desire and shame. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. Tresses (Su) A rusalka's long hair is strong and capable of making powerful primary natural attacks. When it uses its tresses to grapple an opponent, a rusalka does not gain the grappled condition itself. In addition, a rusalka uses its Charisma modifier in addition to its Strength modifier for all combat maneuver checks made with its tresses.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Rusalkas are cruel and bitter fey who inhabit waterways near humanoid settlements. Although rusalkas are not undead, some persist in believing that these fey form from the spirits of those who met a sinister end in the water. Rusalkas do little to dissuade such rumors. Rusalkas are fond of keeping a few charmed monsters or powerful humanoids nearby to aid in their defense or for other forms of cruel and humiliating entertainment, but quickly grow bored with such pets. When this occurs, rusalkas generally murder the creatures and seek more interesting replacement pets.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Baleful Whinny (Su) As a standard action, a sagari can emit a monstrous whinny. Any creature within 60 feet must succeed at a DC 12 Will save or become sickened for 1d4 rounds by the hideous sound. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect. Whether or not the save is successful, the affected creature is immune to the same sagari's baleful whinny for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based. Flight (Su) A sagari's flight is supernatural in nature. Lashing Strike (Ex) Although a sagari is Tiny, it does not provoke attacks of opportunity when it makes melee attacks. In addition, its tentacle attack is a primary attack.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Sagaris haunt forest trails, hanging upside-down from tree branches by the grotesque tentacles that make up their necks. Unexpectedly intelligent, these cruel aberrations swoop down from their perches to attack unsuspecting travelers wandering through the forests. Their piercing whinny causes sickness within those who hear it, the sound waves reverberating within the victims' chests and causing them to feel unwell. Groups of sagaris are particularly dangerous, filling the air with their terrifying neighs and diving upon utterly helpless, nauseated victims in a rush. The tentacle of a sagari is not strong enough to grab or strangle enemies, but serves the creature well as an additional attack to augment its bite. Sagaris are strictly carnivorous, and while they resort to feeding on carrion if necessary, they greatly prefer fresh meat. When a sagari makes its way into a settlement either to wreak havoc or by accident, it can be found hanging from the rafters of a barn or some other structure with a tall ceiling. Stabled livestock are ideal prey for sagaris, who can swiftly kill and devour the flesh of a trapped animal in minutes. A sagari will not attack a creature that it suspects is much stronger, though it will sometimes assault groups of creatures, hoping to sicken enough of its foes to distract them while it attacks the weakest individual. Sagaris are thought to have originally come from the vast caverns beneath the world's surface. While sagaris can speak, they rarely do so with those they deem prey, seeing little point in communicating with food. Despite their relative intelligence, sagaris rarely form societies of any nature, at most traveling in roving packs in search of larger prey to take down as a group. A sagari is 3 feet long from mouth to tentacle and weighs 30 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Grab (Ex) A sargassum fiend can grab Huge or smaller foes, and has a +8 racial bonus on grapple checks rather than the normal +4 bonus most creatures with grab possess. Mirage (Su) A sargassum fiend emits a powerful scent that causes specific, miragelike hallucinations. All creatures within 300 feet of a sargassum fiend must make a DC 18 Will save or become enraptured by the scent. An enraptured creature sees the monster as whatever would most compel it to approach. This might be a lost loved one, a child in need of help, an enchanting mermaid, the promise of dry land, and so on. The extent of this illusion functions as mirage arcana (CL equals the sargassum's CR), but is a mind-affecting phantasm, not a glamer. This effect ends immediately if the plant makes an attack against any target. The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>A sargassum fiend is a free-f loating mass of intelligent seaweed capable of luring its victims to their deaths via a powerful hallucinogenic pheromone. Once the sargassum fiend lures prey within striking distance, it grabs the entranced creature and attempts to crush it to death. Experienced sailors tell tales of entire crews jumping overboard to swim out to a murderous field of the sea plants. The strange pheromone produced by a sargassum fiend can be harvested from the numerous bulbs that grow within the fiend's body, but these bulbs rot quickly once harvested. A fresh bulb lasts for 1 hour before becoming useless; until that point it can be crushed as a standard action to produce a mirage effect as detailed above. A single sargassum fiend generally has 1d6 bulbs of musk when slain-harvesting one requires a DC 29 Survival check. To date, no alchemical or magical process has successfully preserved this musk. Sargassum fiends usually reach sizes up to 10 feet in diameter before splitting, their means of asexual reproduction. Mutations have been known to exist, however, and sea-faring scholars have recorded individual sargassum fiends reaching masses of truly enormous size, up to Colossal. Such enormous sargassum fiends can be created by advancing their Hit Dice by a minimum of 5 HD per size increase step.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Pungency (Ex) A sasquatch's odor is quite powerful, and can be detected at twice the normal distance by scent. Woodland Stride (Ex) A sasquatch can move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Undergrowth that has been magically manipulated to impede movement still affects the sasquatch.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The elusive sasquatches earn their mysterious reputation rightly; they live in unpopulated forests and avoid confrontations with humanoids, only becoming violent when they feel threatened, when their territory is encroached upon, or when they feel they must protect their young. Left to their own devices, sasquatch families are perfectly content to live their lives in the deep woods, leaving behind little to no trace of their passing save for the periodic big footprint in the ground. Despite their considerable bulk, sasquatches are incredibly stealthy creatures, capable of moving through forests in particular with astonishing grace and efficiency. The one trait that somewhat undermines sasquatches' stealth is their distinctive odor-a pungent, musky scent that is often noticeable even when the hidden sasquatches themselves are not apparent. The elusiveness of sasquatches is such that even in a world where dragons and sea monsters are real, many urban scholars doubt the existence of the creatures, citing the lack of evidence of sasquatch lairs or remains as proof of their nonexistence. In truth, sasquatches are simply far more efficient at living in harmony with nature than most humanoids could ever hope to be. To a sasquatch, a deadfall in a forest makes a perfectly fine home. When a sasquatch dies, its kin take pains to bury the body deep and hide all trace of the gravesite to protect the remains from scavengers and evil spirits alike. The sasquatch tongue is a relatively complex language that mixes vocalizations, howls, and "knocking"-the act of striking a solid surface (like a tree or boulder) with a club or stone-and thus tends to blend in with the ambient sounds of a forest. A sasquatch is 8 feet tall and weighs 570 pounds. Rural populaces often have fond nicknames for these creatures, such as wild men, skunk apes, and perhaps most popularly, simply bigfoot.</Description>

    <Description>The enormous deadfall scorpion is disturbingly stealthy for a creature of its size. So named for the creatures' habit of making their lairs amid the hollows created by deadfalls of old trees, deadfall scorpions adorn their already camouf laged carapaces with moss and old branches, then lie in wait to ambush prey when it draws near. They prefer to drag their prey back to their hidden deadfall lairs to eat, and thus incidental treasure can often be found within such a den. A deadfall scorpion is 24 feet long and weighs 10,000 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Anchored (Ex) As a full-round action, a giant sea anemone can affix itself to a solid surface.

This bonus increases by +4 for each size category larger the sea anemone is compared to the opponent attempting the maneuver. The creature can unanchor itself as a full-round action. Poison (Ex) Tentacle-injury; save Fort DC 16; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Dex damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. Sightless (Ex) A sea anemone is blind and is not affected by any effect that relies on sight, such as gaze attacks or blindness.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Giant sea anemones are beautiful but deadly ocean-dwelling vermin that rely on camouf lage and paralytic toxins to draw in their prey. A sea anemone has a long, cylindrical body that ends in a flat circular disc with a slitlike orifice for both ingesting food and dispelling waste. This disc is surrounded by a thicket of tendrils that vary in thickness from fine, hairlike cilia to thick, swollen appendages. The creature uses all of these tentacles at once when it attacks prey. Like their smaller kin, giant sea anemones come in a broad spectrum of colors-many are known for their brilliant hues. Giant sea anemones can move at a slow pace by walking along the projections at their bases. More often, however, these predators affix themselves to rock, coral, or sunken objects like ships, then wait for prey to come to them. As mindless creatures, giant sea anemones have no use for treasure, but the remains of prey digested and then expelled often litter the area around these creatures. Massive sea anemones big enough to eat dolphins, whales, or even sea serpents reportedly exist in the deepest parts of the ocean. Called deep tigers for their alternating fronds of black and brilliant orange, these giant sea anemones are said to lair in undersea ruins and sunken ships, where the promise of sought-after treasure conveniently lures in a constant food supply. Other species of sea anemones exist as well, some smaller but most quite a bit larger and favoring different oceanic regions and depths. You can adjust the stats for the giant sea anemone by changing the Hit Dice and size (adjusting Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution as appropriate) to represent a wide range of species. Often, different species have additional abilities, such as the darkforest anemone's constriction attack, or the deep tiger's ability to squirt acid. The following table lists the most common variants. Species CR Size HD Common anemone 1/4 Tiny 1d8 Bluehair anemone 1/2 Small 2d8 Coffin anemone 1 Medium 3d8 Darkforest anemone 6 Huge 9d8 Siren's bed anemone 9 Gargantuan 14d8 Deep tiger anemone 13 Colossal 19d8</Description>

    <Description>The ocean knows few terrors as unnatural and horrific as the sea bonze. This undead goliath dwells near established shipping lanes or offshore from coastal settlements, where it lurks just beneath the surface of the water until it can strike unsuspecting boats in the dead of night. Sailors often advise launching ocean voyages only during the day on the assumption that doing so might protect them from the sea bonze's attention, but such tactics make little difference to the creature itself, which will trail a particular ship until after dusk, sometimes for hundreds of miles, only to lurch out of the water and lay waste to an entire ship. Sea bonzes are formed from the combined despair and horror of death at sea, such as when a ship sinks and its entire crew drowns. No single restless soul empowers a sea bonze-it combines the anger and doom of all who die in such close proximity. Reawakened as mammoth ship-wreckers, these angry spirits have no memory of their past lives, and seek to inf lict the doom they suffered on others who ply the seas. Their hatred does not make them mindless, however, and more than one lucky crew member has talked her entire ship's way out of total annihilation. Sea bonzes have an unusual respect for those with wit and guile, and will sometimes consider sparing those they deem worthy of their esteem. Those who try to defend themselves with brawn and weapons, however, receive no mercy from the enormous monsters. A sea bonze's flesh is black and leathery like that of a squid, and appears at first glance to be made out of the black waters of the ocean itself. The entire creature is featureless and smooth, making its empty visage all the more horrifying.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Elusive (Ex) As a full-round action while in water, a deep sea serpent can move up to its run speed (200 feet) without leaving any trace of its passing (identical in effect to pass without trace). An elusive deep sea serpent gains a +40 circumstance bonus on its Stealth check. In addition, except when in combat, a sea serpent is considered to be under the effects of a nondetection spell. Both of these effects function at caster level 20th and cannot be dispelled. Powerful Tail (Ex) A deep sea serpent's tail slap is always a primary attack. When a deep sea serpent deals damage to an object with its tail slap or via constrict damage, it ignores the first 10 points of hardness that object possesses. Surge (Ex) A deep sea serpent can surge forward as a full-round action at a speed of 400 feet. It must move in a straight line, but does not provoke attacks of opportunity while surging.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>An enormous monstrosity that makes its home in the darkest depths of the ocean's trenches, the deep sea serpent is as elusive as it is terrifying, the nightmare of sailors making their ways over the vast and seemingly bottomless waters. A deep sea serpent is rarely seen unless it wishes to be seen, and the beast usually has its own mysterious reasons for occasionally coming to the surface. At other times, those reasons are gruesomely obvious-the deep sea serpent rises to the surface to crush ships and devour sailors who tumble from the freshly shattered hulls. It is thought that in incredibly remote parts of the underwater world, even more powerful deep sea serpents exist, beasts with supernatural luminous lures that can be used to blind foes, or with the ability to create overwhelming blasts of electricity that stun or even outright slay prey with a single stroke. Yet perhaps the most unnerving are the rumors of deep sea serpents that possess a remarkable intelligence. Such creatures, if they even exist, are rarely if ever seen near the surface-both their naturally elusive natures and the remote reality of their habitats mean that ensuring the veracity of these claims requires truly extraordinary efforts. A typical deep sea serpent measures 50 feet long and weighs 35,000 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Bay (Su) When a shadow mastiff howls or barks, all creatures within a 300-foot spread except evil outsiders must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or become panicked for 1d4 rounds. This is a sonic, mind-affecting fear effect. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by the same mastiff's bay for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. Shadow Blend (Su) In any condition of illumination other than full daylight, a shadow mastiff disappears into the shadows, giving it concealment (50% miss chance). Artificial illumination, even a light or continual flame spell, does not negate this ability; a daylight spell, however, does. A shadow mastiff can suspend or resume this ability as a free action.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Tireless hunters, stealthy trackers, and deadly predators, shadow mastiffs stalk the dark corners of the Outer Planes, preying upon all beings that stray from the light. These beasts have little in common with actual canines aside from their general forms (although with the notable addition of a long, spiked tail), their bodies being the evolution of countless centuries hunting the most merciless wildernesses of the Outer Planes and the Shadow Plane. On the Material Plane, they prefer to travel in shadow, moving soundlessly and unseen to find prey, hunting in vicious sport just as often as in hunger. Shadow mastiffs stand over 4 feet tall, with most weighing nearly 300 pounds. In combat, these stealthy beasts prefer to fight in shadows; they shy from areas of bright light unless faced with no other choice and use their bay to force their enemies to flee from well-lit areas. Shadow mastiffs prefer to hunt in groups, using pack tactics to lure prey into traps and to draw it away from sources of light. They do not make lairs, and are usually not found with any sort of treasure, unless it is on the body of a recently slain victim. Shadow mastiffs are popular guardians among spellcasters capable of conjuring them via lesser planar ally or lesser planar binding. Undead spellcasters and evil outsiders are immune to shadow mastiffs' fearful bay; others who are not immune might intentionally expose themselves to the creatures' bay at some point during the daylight hours when the resulting panic won't directly impact other tasks. As a general rule, it's safe to assume that any site using shadow mastiffs as guardians has already been affected by the bay, and that its inhabitants are thus immune to the ability's effects for the remaining 24 hours of that day. Larger shadow mastiffs exist-creatures the size of horses or even bigger. These creatures have different shapes, looking less like dogs and more like larger creatures such as lions, dinosaurs, or even dragons. Such creatures have additional racial Hit Dice, and could even have extra abilities such as flight or breath weapons.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Cold (Su) A shae's touch saps heat from living creatures, leaving patches of colorless flesh rather than physical wounds. A shae can deal 1d6 points of cold damage with a touch. It adds +1d6 points of cold damage to any melee weapon damage it deals. Lesser Shadow Evocation (Sp) This spell-like ability functions identically to the spell shadow evocation, but it can only create quasi-real versions of sorcerer or wizard evocation spells of 2nd level or lower. This spell-like ability is the equivalent of a 3rd-level spell.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The mysterious people known as the shaes are natives of the Shadow Plane. In their own language, their name means "unbound" or "unfettered." According to shae history, they were once humanoids who through tireless study and self-perfection managed to transcend the bonds of a definite form. Though they still bear roughly humanoid shapes, shaes' outlines are perpetually wispy and impossible for any non-shaes to focus directly on. Though shaes may engage in all the same pursuits and professions as other humanoids, their overwhelming racial pride often leads them to see all other humanoids- especially humans-as lesser beings. Ironically, this casual disdain sometimes leads individual shaes to gather harems of worshipful human consorts, and it is from these unions that fetchlings often issue. Humans involved in such relationships often hope to learn the secret of the shaes' power over shadows, and claim that only in sacred union with the creatures can one glimpse their true features. Shaes are roughly 6 feet tall and weigh 100 pounds. They often wear masks and form-fitting clothing when around other creatures in order to give the lesser beings something to focus on (such garments do not impede their blur ability).</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Prescience (Su) A shedu can see all the possible outcomes of any of its own futures. This grants the creature an insight bonus to its AC and on initiative checks and Reflex saves equal to its Wisdom bonus (+6 for most shedus).</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Shedus live far from the hustle and bustle of humanity in harsh deserts. There they populate caves, ruins, or ancient temples reclaimed from the shifting sands. In these places of refuge, shedus contemplate the struggle between good and evil throughout the universe. Tireless vehicles of good and kindness, shedus fight against outsiders who corrupt and threaten humanity. Skilled in healing, shedus focus on eliminating plagues, even hunting down outsiders and undead working in that destructive medium. Shedus rarely make their homes near each other. This is not out of any sort of animosity, but rather from a feeling that having two or more shedus within close proximity wastes the opportunity to provide aid to a larger region. When a shedu roams through the lands of another, it always seeks out the local shedu for an opportunity to talk and share knowledge over the course of 3 days. After this period, the visiting shedu departs with a new perspective and more points to ponder in its eternal struggle against the evils of the world.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Destroy Soul (Su) A shinigami possesses six gems in which it encapsulates souls with its soul bind spell-like ability. These gems are only useful to the shinigami that owns them, and if the shinigami dies, the gems are destroyed as well. As a standard action once per day, a shinigami can hold up a gem that currently contains a soul and crush it, permanently destroying the soul within and releasing a 30-foot-radius burst of negative energy that inflicts 1d6 negative levels on all creatures in the area of effect. A successful DC 30 Fortitude save reduces this to 1 negative level. The soul destroyed in the process of using this ability can only be brought back to life by means of a miracle or wish spell. This is a death effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Feared as truly impartial and merciless harbingers of death, shinigamis are relentless in their pursuit of dispensing quick and just deaths upon those who would seek to disrupt the delicate balance of life. Unlike other, more sinister bringers of doom, shinigamis do not take pleasure in their work and do not seek to impose suffering-although there are exceptions. Some individuals, aptly described by their kin as "rogue shinigamis," subscribe to either more merciful or more despicable forms of execution, and are either lawful good or lawful evil. Victims who have had their lives spared by kind shinigamis praise the angels of death for their clemency and willingness to listen to the victims' plight, while other dastardly survivors have successfully cheated or bribed their way out of death by manipulating credulous or less honorable shinigami. A shinigami is 9 feet tall and weighs 130 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Aura of Peace (Su) Creatures within a 50-foot spread from a simurgh feel a sensation of peace wash over them, as if affected by calm emotions, except the simurgh can choose which creatures are affected. A DC 28 Will save negates the effects of this aura for 1 round, but a new save must be made each round to continue to resist the effects. The saving throw is Charisma-based. Banishing Swipe (Su) A simurgh can use its radiant tail to return creatures to their native planes. In addition to taking damage, any extraplanar creature touched by a simurgh's tail must succeed at a DC 28 Will save or be affected as if by banishment. A creature that makes this save cannot be affected by the same simurgh's banishing swipe for the next 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based. Glaring Ray (Su) A simurgh can blast a fiery ray of brilliant light from its eyes as a standard action to a range of 100 feet. Radiant Feathers (Su) Once per day as a standard action, a simurgh can fan out its glimmering tail feathers and blast its foes with a 100-foot cone of radiant light from its tail. Aside from its size, this attack is identical to a prismatic spray (DC 28). The save is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Regarded as living legends, simurghs are held in high regard by desert dwellers. Those who live in the desert lands where these benevolent creatures sometimes reside consider it a lifetime's worth of luck even to spot one soaring through the sky. Simurghs prefer to keep to themselves, well out of the way of lesser creatures and their often dubious morals, though they can be relied upon for aid when called by those in true need and with a pure heart. A simurgh can live for thousands of years, and frequent mentions of these giant avian beings throughout a region's historical record are more often than not sightings of the same creature.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Stunning Shock (Su) A siyokoy can emit a strong electrical charge from its tail. When it hits a creature with its tail slap, the attack deals 3d6 points of electrical damage and the target must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. Swim-By Attack (Ex) Extremely quick in the water, a siyokoy gains Spring Attack as a bonus feat when swimming.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Siyokoys are eel-like aquatic creatures often mistaken for merfolk by sailors. On closer inspection, however, siyokoys' appearance might make one question the vision of said sailors, for apart from their humanoid arms, siyokoys are very much creatures of the sea. Two primary species of siyokoys exist, although both are essentially identical as far as game statistics are concerned. The most commonly encountered siyokoys are those that dwell amid the caves and crags of coral reefs in relatively shallow oceanic waters. These siyokoys tend to have colorful patterns on their flesh to mimic the riot of hues the typical coral reef displays. Reef-dwelling siyokoys are fond of decorating their lairs with particularly strange or colorful specimens of coral, especially when such marine growths encrust sunken treasures. A siyokoy variant that is encountered less frequently dwells in the deeper abysses of the ocean, far below the limits of the sun's ability to light. These siyokoys are darker colored, and they tend to be darker in personality as well. Whereas those dwelling in the bright, sunlit environs of a coral reef might be capricious or playful, those who dwell in the dark, vast deeps of the sea are often morbid, morose, and even sadistic. Most evil siyokoys dwell in such lightless, forgotten reaches of the world's oceans. Regardless of where they dwell, siyokoys adore shipwrecks and long-forgotten ruins claimed by the oceans. Exploring these relics and recovering strange and wondrous treasures is what most siyokoys live for, and a siyokoy's lair is often decorated with the results of these scavenging expeditions to sunken ships and flooded cities. Strangely, siyokoys avoid making their lairs amid such ruins, mostly out of a strange superstition the creatures share about these areas-it is not lucky, say siyokoys, to sleep in a place where air breathing creatures have drowned. A siyokoy is 7 feet long and weighs 200 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Musk (Ex) Up to twice per day, a skunk can spray a stream of noxious musk at a single target within 10 feet as a standard action.

    <Description>These small mammals are well known to humanoids and forest creatures alike, with their distinctive black-and-white-striped markings and infamous scent glands. Creatures like big cats or wolves that normally would make a meal of such a small creature give skunks plenty of space, for they have learned well that the combination of black and white on a skunk's back equates to a hideously overpowering stench.</Description>

    <Description>Much larger than their passive cousins, giant skunks are an aggressive lot. Having a greater bulk to maintain, giant skunks feed on creatures beyond just grubs and insects, often hunting small mammals and reptiles by night in addition to giant versions of insects. While giant skunks are dangerous to nearby settlements, farmers find a positive aspect in their presence, valuing the creatures' taste for giant insects and other more dangerous vermin.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Breath Weapon (Su) As a standard action, a sleipnir can exhale a 30- foot cone of shimmering, rainbow-colored light. Every creature in the area is randomly struck by one or more beams, as a prismatic spray spell (DC 22 half or negates). The sleipnir may use this ability once every 1d6 rounds, up to 3 times per day. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Sleipnirs are a legendary breed of magical, eight-legged horses. Most sleipnirs have jet-black coats and long, flowing manes and tails, though occasionally a sleipnir foal is born with a white or shimmering silver coat. Such rare sleipnirs sometimes display additional abilities beyond those of their darker kin. A typical sleipnir stands 6 to 7 feet tall at the shoulder, measures about 12 feet long, and weighs upward of 1,600 pounds. Believed to be descended from the mystical steeds of gods, sleipnirs have spread throughout the Material Plane. While sleipnirs cannot actually fly, they are able to walk on air as easily as on land, and spend much of their time galloping across the skies of their homes. Although sleipnirs lack the ability to travel between planes themselves, riders have brought them as mounts far beyond the Material Plane, and populations of sleipnirs can be found on several of the more hospitable Outer Planes as well. Sleipnirs are highly prized as steeds, but as intelligent magical beasts, they cannot be trained using the Handle Animal skill, and those trying to do so find them intractable and even violent. Although they cannot speak, sleipnirs understand Auran, and one seeking a sleipnir as a mount must convince the creature to serve using Diplomacy, Intimidate, or other means. Sleipnirs are generally indifferent to most creatures, meaning they can be found serving as steeds to creatures of all alignments, from good to evil. Riding a sleipnir requires no equipment other than a normal saddle, and they are well trained in combat from birth. A rider does not need to make a Ride check to control a sleipnir in battle, but must make a Ride check to attack in the same round that the sleipnir attacks. A sleipnir can carry 519 pounds as a light load, 1,038 pounds as a medium load, and 1,560 pounds as a heavy load.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Roar (Su) An androsphinx can roar up to three times per day as a standard action. Each progressive roar has a different effect, depending upon whether it is the first, second, or third of the androsphinx's roars for that day. All of these roars are sonic effects that fill a 60-foot-radius burst, centered on the androsphinx; the save DCs are Charisma-based. Sphinxes are immune to all of the effects of an androsphinx's roars. First Roar: Affected creatures become frightened for 2d6 rounds (DC 19 Will negates). This is a mind-affecting fear effect in addition to being a sonic effect. Second Roar: Affected creatures are paralyzed with fear and deafened for 1d4 rounds (DC 19 Will negates). This is a mind-affecting fear effect in addition to being a sonic effect. Third Roar: Affected creatures take a 2d4 penalty to Strength for 2d4 rounds and take 2d8 points of sonic damage. Creatures smaller than the androsphinx are knocked prone. A DC 19 Fortitude save negates the Strength penalty and being knocked prone. Spells An androsphinx casts divine spells as a 6th-level cleric. They do not gain access to domains or other cleric abilities.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The mightiest of the common sphinxes, androsphinxes see themselves as all that is worthy and noble in the species and carry themselves as though the weight of the world rests upon their good example. They view criosphinxes with paternalistic condescension, hieracosphinxes with poorly veiled disgust, and gynosphinxes as the only other sphinxes worthy of their time. Androsphinxes put on a gruff and cantankerous front to outsiders. They make no effort to hide annoyance when displeased. Androsphinxes tend to be territorial, though less so than other sphinxes. They almost invariably warn and bluster before attacking, and nearly always heed a call to parley. Androsphinxes barter information and conversation for safe passage, not treasure. Androsphinxes are 12 feet tall and weigh 1,000 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Swooping Charge (Ex) A charging criosphinx deals 4d4+12 points of damage with its gore attack. A flying criosphinx who drops at least 20 feet in altitude as part of a charge deals 6d4+18 points instead.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Perhaps the least leonine of all sphinxes, the ram-headed criosphinx lacks the intellect of androsphinxes and gynosphinxes, but still outmatches the dim-witted hieracosphinxes. Like hieracosphinxes and androsphinxes, criosphinxes are always male. At the start of a battle, a criosphinx lowers its horns and crashes into foes, clawing enemies it has engaged. It favors charging down on foes from great heights. Criosphinxes crave wealth over nearly all other things, habitually extorting tolls for safe passage from any who pass their lands. Groups who cannot pay must yield one of their number or a pair of mounts for the criosphinx's meal- single travelers must fight or die. Unlike gynosphinxes, no mere riddle suffices-only the shine of metal or the gleam of jewels can satisfy a criosphinx. Little can convince a criosphinx to part with even a single coin save the lust that its kind bears for the gynosphinx. Criosphinxes crave mating with gynosphinxes above all else, and pay well for the whereabouts of a female, or better yet, a well-crafted riddle that might impress one. For their part, gynosphinxes prefer to have little to do with what they mock as the sheep of sphinxes, though they sometimes lower themselves to a brief assignation in the rare event a criosphinx manages to impress them with wealth or wit. Some criosphinxes set themselves as soothsayers of the desert, trading upon the storied wisdom of androsphinxes and gynosphinxes to deceive gullible travelers. Like their more blustering brethren, they seek wealth from passersby, but for the purposes of dispersing information rather than in exchange for safe passage. Such reliable information as they possess usually comes from idle conversation with the creatures of the desert, with criosphinxes using their inborn ability to speak with animals. A criosphinx lacking in sound information usually fabricates a pleasing lie. Criosphinxes detest hieracosphinxes, regarding them as little more than beasts and a disgrace to their noble race. They drive off their falcon-headed cousins with mock-charges and posturing, escalating to full-f ledged attacks if ignored. Androsphinxes they view with mixed fear and respect, and gynosphinxes with disdain and lust.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Shriek (Su) The shrill shriek of a hieracosphinx deafens non-sphinxes within a 60-foot-radius spread for 2d4 rounds (DC 16 Fortitude negates). Once a creature successfully saves against this effect, it is immune to the hieracosphinx's shriek for 24 hours. Using this ability is a standard action. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The least intelligent of the common sphinxes, hieracosphinxes are a cowardly, cruel-hearted lot. All are male. They despise the larger and cleverer androsphinxes and criosphinxes. Toward gynosphinxes they hold a twisted mix of a lust and hate, simultaneously envying their beauty and power while craving them as mates. Hieracosphinxes attack other sphinxes whenever they have them at a disadvantage. Male sphinxes of other species they tear to shreds or drive away, whereas they prefer to leave gynosphinxes ravaged but alive. The other species of sphinx likewise hold nothing but disdain for hieracosphinxes, and typically attack these vile beasts on sight. Hieracosphinxes guard their territory ruthlessly against weaker intruders, seldom giving warning before they attack. They have no use for banter and riddles, making most efforts at diplomacy rather ineffective, but can be convinced to call off their attacks by convincing shows of force coupled with information on the location of weaker prey or a gynosphinx. Though poor fliers, they still prefer to fight from the air, the better to escape if the combat turns against them. As they lack the ego and resourcefulness of the rest of their breed, hieracosphinxes can be pressed into service of mounts, particularly by those of similarly evil dispositions. Hieracosphinxes chafe under such service but submit to more powerful riders, though they still inf lict their foul tempers on any weaker creatures that happen by. A grown hieracosphinx can easily consume a full horse's worth of meat in a day, making their upkeep rather expensive. Even with these drawbacks, hieracosphinx eggs command values of up to 1,500 gp on the open market, as do young hieracosphinxes. It takes 3 years for a hieracosphinx to reach maturity, after which an untrained hieracosphinx only rarely accepts a rider without magical compulsion. Trainers, though hard to come by, charge thousands of gold pieces to rear and train a hieracosphinx, owing to the risk to life and limb. A light load for a hieracosphinx is up to 350 pounds; a medium load, 351-700 pounds; and a heavy load, 701-1,050 pounds. A typical hieracosphinx is just short of 9 feet long and weighs 600 pounds. Hieracosphinxes detest bearing a rider into battle, thus increasing the DCs of any combat-related Ride checks by +5.</Description>

    <Description>Giant crab spiders are dangerous ambush predators that live in dense forest vegetation. Though crab spiders are not web spinners, they are truly gifted climbers and use this talent to clamber up into places where they can observe wide areas from on high. Named for their curious scuttling walk and wide-legged stance, giant crab spiders are rarely larger than a typical adult half ling.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Implant (Ex) A spider eaters grows its eggs inside of a living host. Implanting an egg in a host is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, and the target must be helpless but alive. Once an egg is implanted, it exudes paralytic enzymes that not only keep the victim in state of perpetual paralysis, but also keep it nourished and alive in its comatose but fully aware state. This condition lasts until the egg hatches in 1d6 weeks, at which point the young spider eater consumes most of its host, killing it. An egg can be surgically removed with a DC 25 Heal check (this check deals 2d6 points of damage to the host regardless of success), at which point the host recovers from the paralysis in 1d6 rounds. Any magical effect that removes paralysis or disease (such as remove paralysis, remove disease, or heal) also destroys the egg, but mere immunity to paralysis or disease does not offer protection. Poison (Ex) Sting-injury; save Fort DC 17; frequency 1/minute for 6 minutes; effect paralysis for 1 minute; cure 1 save. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>An amalgam of dangerous creatures, this predator, as its name suggests, prefers to hunt and feed upon spiders. Their greatest boon to spider hunting, aside from their stinger, ability to fly, and strong pincers, is their ability to slip through the stickiest of webs in order to get to their prey. Unfortunately for other creatures, when a spider eater is denied its preferred prey, it seeks out any living creature it can find to serve as a host for its ravenous young. When hunting, a spider eater drops from the air onto its victim, stinging the prey with its barbed tail. The creature then returns to the air and hovers, waiting for its venom to take hold. Once the opponent succumbs to paralysis, the spider eater lands again, either to feed or implant its egg. Although more intelligent than the typical beast, to the point where it can understand a language (usually Aklo), the spider eater is relatively slow-witted. Nevertheless, it is intelligent enough that it resists training-those who seek to ally with spider eaters must befriend them via diplomacy and gifts of spiders to feed upon or implant eggs into, or via intimidation and coercion. A spider eater measures roughly 14 feet long and stands 6 feet tall. The creature has a wingspan just over 20 feet and weighs almost 2,000 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Luminous (Su) A sprite naturally sheds light equal to that provided by a torch. A sprite can control the color and intensity of the light as a swift action, reducing it to the dimness of a candle or even extinguishing its luminosity entirely if it wishes.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Sprites gather in groups deep in forested lands, aligned to the cause of defending nature. Whole tribes of sprites deem themselves protectors of a certain person, place, or creature of importance in their lands, even if the being doesn't actually want or need protecting. A sprite's body is naturally luminous, although the sprite can vary the color and intensity of its body as it wishes. Shortly after death, a sprite's body simply melts away to a twinkling vapor. Sprites are among the smallest of fey, standing just over 9 inches in height and rarely weighing more than 1 or 2 pounds. Sprites are more primitive in many ways than most fey. They enjoy each other's company, but tend to be distrustful of other fey and assume any humanoids and any other creatures that they haven't expressly chosen to protect mean to do them ill. Even animals are generally regarded as dangerous. Much of this is due to sprites' diminutive size, which makes them popular targets for predators. As a result, a sprite's initial reaction to danger is typically to flee-it uses its spell-like abilities to delay or distract pursuers, and relies on its speed in flight and its size to allow it to escape in the end. While sprites themselves are relatively uncultured and savage in nature, they do have a healthy curiosity for all things magical in nature. They are particularly drawn to sites of great but latent magical power, such as the ruins of ancient temples. This curiosity makes them unusually receptive to roles as familiars as well. A 5th-level chaotic neutral spellcaster with the Improved Familiar feat can gain a sprite as a familiar.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Glare (Su) As a standard action, in any area of normal or brighter light, a stymphalidies can ruffle its metallic feathers in such a way as to blind all creatures nearby. Any creature within 30 feet must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d6 minutes. A creature can defend against this effect in the same way it would a gaze attack. This is a sight-based effect. The save DC is Constitution-based. Wing Razors (Ex) A stymphalidies's metallic feathers are razor-sharp. In addition to being able to slash creatures with its wings as a melee attack, it may beat its wings, flinging two large, feathered shards at a single target. These wing razors deal 2d6 points of damage and cause bleed, with a range increment of 50 feet. A stymphalidies can use this attack a number of times per day equal to its Constitution modifier (5 times per day for most stymphalidies).</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Man-eating birds of prey, the rare creatures known as stymphalidies stalk plains and coastlines, shredding warm-blooded animals and unwary travelers with their steely-bladed feathers and daggerlike beaks. From a distance, stymphalidies might easily be mistaken for cranes, ibises, or other long-necked birds, though in full sunlight their gleaming feathers and the haze of blood lingering from past meals are impossible to mistake. When not at rest, flocks of the creatures soar high on warm currents of air, relying upon their keen eyesight to spot suitable prey far below. Because of their voracious appetites, flocks of stymphalidies must claim a vast swath of territory to maintain their feeding habits. Fortunately for the folk of civilized lands, stymphalidies rarely encroach upon areas well traveled by humanoids and other creatures clever enough to bring down one of these metallic-winged avians. Stymphalidies breed at an astonishing rate, however, and overpopulation and exhaustion of game frequently force extraordinarily large and deadly groups of the creatures to band together in search of new lands and new prey to devour. Peculiarly, the feathers and beak of a stymphalidies are made of steel-like material similar to the metallic hide of a gorgon. Smaller varieties of stymphalidies exist, including a variant with a penchant for swarming, but the towering creature presented here is by far the most commonly encountered of its kind. This stymphalidies stands 13 feet tall, with a wingspan of 25 feet and a weight of 250 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Elemental Assault (Su) Once per day as a swift action, a suli can call on the elemental power lurking in its veins to shroud its arms in acid, cold, electricity, or fire. Unarmed strikes with its elbows or hands (or attacks with weapons held in those hands) deal +1d6 points of damage of the appropriate energy type. This lasts for 1 round per level. The suli can end the effects of its elemental power early as a free action.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Sulis (or suli-jann) are minor offshoots of the jann that live among humans. They are tall and look like ordinary men and women but for their abnormal beauty and the occasional flash of elemental light in their eyes. Though physically superior to and more attractive than normal humans, some suli-jann remain unaware of their genie heritage until later in life, when contact with a full-blooded genie draws forth a portion of their elemental power. While all sulis can trace their lineage back to a janni ancestor, very few have an immediate janni parent. In most cases, this legacy lies fallow in the blood for generations, only to emerge decades or even centuries later. Those whose powers become apparent early on usually lead troubled lives as youths, as the question of a child's origins tears some families apart; few of these unfortunate sulis grow up knowing anything of the peace of a happy home. Sulis age at the same rate as humans and are physically identical to humans in terms of height and weight. During their youth, sulis tend to be slightly smaller than their fully human peers, but grow quickly to their full adult height upon reaching their teenage years. Sulis are impulsive and passionate by nature, and even those sulis who know nothing of their genie blood possess a measure of personal pride. SULI CHARACTERS Sulis are defined by class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. Sulis have the following racial traits. +2 Strength, +2 Charisma, -2 Intelligence: Sulis tend to be strong and charming, but slow-witted. Low-Light Vision: Sulis can see twice as far as humans in dim light. Negotiator: Sulis are keen negotiators, and gain a +2 racial bonus on Diplomacy and Sense Motive checks. Elemental Assault: See above. Elemental Resistance: Sulis have resistance to acid 5, cold 5, electricity 5, and fire 5. Languages: Sulis begin play speaking Common and any one elemental language of their choice (Aquan, Auran, Ignan, or Terran). Sulis with high Intelligence scores can choose from among the following bonus languages: Aquan, Auran, Draconic, Ignan, and Terran.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Sake Affinity (Su) As a swift action, a tanuki can take a swig of sake from the gourd it always carries at its side. When it does so, it gains the effect of one of the following spells at caster level 7th: divine favor, false life, haste, or rage. Unusual tanukis might have additional spell effect choices at the GM's discretion. Each time a tanuki takes a swig of sake, it becomes progressively drunker and takes a -1 penalty to its AC and on Reflex saves for 1 minute. These penalties stack.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Jolly tricksters, tanukis love deceiving humanoids and other intelligent creatures. This mischief is usually harmless, but can turn spiteful in some situations. Popular folklore stories claim tanukis are the transformed souls of tools and housewares that were used for more than 100 years, a myth that probably results from tanukis' ability to magically create or alter objects. Mostly encountered in disguise, tanukis enjoy visiting humanoid settlements and interacting with the people. They usually visit taverns and eateries, joining in feasts and celebrations whenever possible. Tanukis always change their disguises and rarely visit the same town twice in the same month. Tanuki mischief becomes spiteful to those who defile nature. Hunters who kill for sport or those who log trees from the forest without seeding new ones find their weapons and tools transformed into bowls and teacups. Tanukis also put more effort into their pranks when the target is a braggart, a bully, or someone of poor moral character. They like to prank brooding types as well, always hoping to bring a smile to the hard faces of such dour folk. Because of their trickster nature, tanukis get along with many fey creatures. Some tanukis even deal well with spirits, often helping them pass from this world. Though rare, violent and morbid tanukis occasionally walk the lands, bringing suffering to those they encounter. Filled with spite, these evil tanukis pull sadistic pranks, and horror stories tell of tanukis killing old women and tricking their husbands into eating soups made from their flesh. A tanuki is 5 feet tall and weighs 180 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Swallow Whole (Su) A taotieh can expand its jaws to swallow Large or smaller creatures. When swallowed, a victim is transported to its own lightless pocket dimension-a stone prison just large enough to contain the victim. Creatures do not take damage within this pocket dimension, but there is only enough air inside to last for 3 rounds. At the end of the third round, the trapped creature must hold its breath or risk suffocation. A creature that attempts to carve its way out of this dimension with a weapon must be able to penetrate the surrounding walls' hardness 8. When a creature manages to cut its way out of this dimension, it appears to leap out of the taotieh's mouth to emerge into any square adjacent to the taotieh's space-no actual hole is created in the creature, and new creatures that are swallowed later must cut their own way out. When a taotieh is destroyed, its body bursts open to allow the contents of its extradimensional stomachs to spill out into adjacent spaces. A taotieh can swallow up to four creatures at any one time.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Symbols of power but also of gluttony, taotiehs are guardian constructs formed of stone and built around a pocket of extradimensional space. Taotiehs are used to ward sacred or secluded areas from enemies and trespassers. Their semblance to tigers extends even to the animal's abilities in combat, as taotiehs are feared for their vicious attacks. The extradimensional space at the core of a taotieh allows the construct to swallow opponents of its own size and then shunt its victims into an airless pocket of space inside. A creature capable of existing without air could well spend an eternity inside a taotieh if it couldn't smash its way out or escape via plane-traversing magic, in which case it must wait for outside forces to slay its captor. Tales abound of great treasures and even greater dangers being unleashed upon a taotieh's destruction. CONSTRUCTION A taotieh is built from 12,000 pounds of marble, treated with special unguents and chemicals.

    <SpecialAbilities>Poison Gasp (Ex) A tatzlwyrm's breath contains a poisonous vapor. While grappling, instead of making a bite or rake attack, a tatzlwyrm can breathe poison into its victim's face. A tatzlwyrm must begin its turn grappling to use this ability-it can't begin a grapple and use its poison gasp in the same turn. Tatzlwyrm poison: Breath-inhaled; save Fort DC 12; frequency 1/round for 2 rounds; effect 1d2 Str damage; cure 1 save. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Tatzlwyrms are thought to be primeval relatives of true dragons, having branched off the line millennia ago and evolved in a way that sets them notably apart. Undersized compared to their larger cousins, tatzlwyrms are nonetheless ferocious in their own right. And while tatzlwyrms are hardly impressive specimens when put beside their notorious relatives, most other reptiles can't compare to them mentally. They understand Draconic, though other languages are beyond most tatzlwyrms' limited comprehension. Nevertheless, tatzlwyrms are deeply cunning, building complex lairs and rudimentary traps. Tatzlwyrms are quite rare, and only a few particularly curious and lucky adventurers can claim to have seen a living specimen. Reports do agree on some basic features, however. About the size of a full-grown human, tatzlwyrms have only two limbs and no wings, and possess a weak poisonous breath similar to the breath weapons of their true dragon relatives. An adult tatzlwyrm is 6 to 8 feet long, including its winding, organless tail, and it weighs between 400 and 500 pounds. A tatzlwyrm's scales give the creature limited camouf lage, ranging through various shades of green, brown, and gray. Like true dragons, tatzlwyrms are strict carnivores. They spend most of their time hiding, waiting to attack any prey that ventures too near. They consume their food slowly in the dark security and seclusion of their lairs. Tatzlwyrms have a remarkable knack for ambush and camouf lage.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Keen Weapons (Su) After it has engaged in at least 1 round of combat, a terra-cotta soldier's weapons automatically gain the benefits of keen weapon (CL 6th). This effect persists until the end of the battle. Rank Fighting (Ex) Whenever a terra-cotta soldier is adjacent to another terra-cotta soldier, it gains a +2 dodge bonus to its AC and a +2 bonus on saving throws, attack rolls, and damage rolls.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>A terra-cotta soldier is crafted from clay and fired into ceramic, and is usually sculpted to resemble an armored human soldier, although terra-cotta soldiers resembling other races, such as hobgoblins, tengus, or even demons and oni, are also common. Terra-cotta soldiers are often created to guard the tomb of powerful rulers, standing in silent ranks to guard their liege even after his or her death. These soldiers stand vigil for centuries, animating only to defend the tomb and its riches from tomb robbers. Terra-cotta soldiers are typically painted with colored lacquer, though this decoration is often worn away from use or faded with age. A terra-cotta soldier stands 6 feet tall and weighs 600 pounds. Unlike most constructs, a terra-cotta soldier carries within its form a spark of intelligence. This is hardly enough to grant the construct the ability to speak or otherwise engage in free will, but it is enough for it to carry out more complex tactics than most constructs are capable of. It's not unusual for a terra-cotta soldier to possess different feats or use different weapons. Two relatively common variants are summarized below. Terra-Cotta Archer (+0 CR): Terra-cotta archers are simply terra-cotta soldiers outfitted with composite longbows. Terra-cotta archers have Improved Initiative, Point-Blank Shot, Precise Shot, and Weapon Focus (longbow) as feats. Terra-Cotta Horseman (+1 CR): Some terra-cotta soldiers are crafted to resemble warriors mounted on terra-cotta horses, though rider and mount are one creature. Terra-cotta horsemen are Large terra-cotta soldiers with 10 racial Hit Dice and the trample and undersized weapons special abilities. Terra-cotta horsemen are usually outfitted with lances instead of swords, and have Improved Bull Rush, Improved Initiative, Improved Overrun, Power Attack, and Weapon Focus (lance) as feats. CONSTRUCTION A terra-cotta soldier's body is made from 600 pounds of clay, fired with rare and magical glazes worth 500 gp.

    <SpecialAbilities>Launch Merope (Su) A thriae queen can launch a stream of merope from a gland in her lower body in a 60-foot line as a standard action. A thriae queen using this ability can control the purity of the merope she launches, which makes it either harm those it touches or heal them. If a thriae queen chooses to make her merope harmful, all creatures in the area of effect take 20d8 points of acid damage (Reflex DC 29 for half ). In addition, any creature in the area of effect is also staggered for 1d4 rounds (or 1 round if it succeeds at its Reflex save). If she uses it to heal, the merope heals all living creatures in the area of effect for 10d8 points of damage. A thriae queen can use this ability once every 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. Merope Coat (Su) A thriae queen is covered in a thin layer of merope. This coating acts as a magical barrier between spells cast at the thriae queen, as though she were constantly under the effects of spell turning. The coat affects a maximum of eight spell levels-when a spell effect is turned, this coating is depleted by a number of spell levels equal to the level of the spell reflected. The queen regenerates this coating at a rate of one spell level per round. A spell in excess of what the merope coat can currently reflect is not reflected, and reduces the merope coat to a score of 0. Spells that fail to penetrate the queen's spell resistance do not reduce the merope coat's efficiency in this manner. Spawn Soldiers (Su) Three times per day as a standard action, a thriae queen can spawn a large swarm of wasps. This functions as four separate wasp swarms (Bestiary 275) that occupy all of the squares adjacent to the thriae queen. These swarms do not harm any thriae, and while they move with the queen as she moves, the swarms cannot leave her side. The swarms last until they are destroyed or 1 hour passes, at which point the swarms die on their own. Poison (Ex) Sting-injury; save Fort DC 29; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Con plus staggered for 1 round; cure 2 consecutive saves.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The most powerful individual within any given thriae colony, the queen is a divine soothsayer, a provider of life, and a destroyer of those would seek to disrupt the order of the colony. Viewed by her children as a benevolent matriarch rather than a mother, the thriae queen is the only fertile member of the colony, and thus the sole reproducer should the colony's population meet a devastating blow, whether through plague, famine, or war. A queen is revered by soldiers and seers alike, both for her physical might and her divine power, and she exemplifies the very best of thriae society in terms of strength, insight, and magnetism. While a queen is often too busy to entertain guests of a thriae hive, those intruders who do catch a glimpse of her are captured by her beauty and grace, and many would follow her if only to be by her side. But those who are allowed to enjoy the queen's company are few, and those few are carefully selected from among the hive's greatest warriors and priestesses, soldiers and seers whose powers have shown them to be skillful as well as loyal. Most thriae colonies only have one queen, though particularly large or far-reaching hives have been known to have as many as three at any given time. Thriae queens are the ultimate authority within a hive, and make most of the major decisions regarding the colony's growth. Only the wealthiest and most respected outsiders are granted an audience with the ever-busy queen, whose numerous duties around the hive are analogous to those of any other ruler of a small kingdom. They grant only audiences regarding matters of the utmost concern, matters that stimulate the curiosity of a thriae queen and require not merely the cryptic readings of seers but a true divination as only a queen can provide. When not divining or performing governmental tasks, a thriae queen can often be found in her private chamber, where she lies with male consorts, lays eggs, cares for her larvae, and creates the vast stores of merope used every day within the hive. Consorts are chosen carefully, as they are constantly within extremely close proximity to the queen, who is far from vulnerable in her own right but nonetheless often prefers to avoid conf licts with would-be assassins or burglars. A thriae queen lays fertilized eggs in one of the waxy, golden cells of her chamber walls. Thriae eggs go through several stages of growth before becoming fully formed thriae-the longest stage of development is the larval stage, which is a crucial point in determining the formation of a thriae. Most larvae are fed merope while they grow, but in the height of her power, a thriae queen selects a single larva to be her successor, and she feeds that individual a special substance secreted from her merope gland called royal merope. This thick, jellylike substance strengthens the larva and causes it to grow greatly in size, and when it pupates and hatches, it does so as a fully grown thriae queen. The mother queen teaches its successor in the ways of divining as well as ruling a colony. The successor then faces a choice-either remaining in the colony she was born into and furthering the growth of the hive, or setting out on her own to establish an allied colony. If she does the latter, the remaining queen must birth another successor, which is not considered so much a bother as it is an unavoidable circumstance. Queens do not look upon successors who leave as deserting daughters, instead viewing them as future allies for the colony down the road. THRIAE LARVAE Larvae who are fed regular merope become soldiers, seers, or other contributing members of thriae society. While more susceptible to harm in the larval stage, thriae larvae still pose a threat to unwary intruders who find themselves among the cells of numerous unhatched thriae. Creatures that succeed at a DC 15 Perception check or Knowledge (nature) check notice larvae embedded in the hive's waxy walls. Unhatched thriae larvae can detect disturbances outside their cell walls, and burst from the cells in order to prey upon the nutritious intruders. Any creature within 5 feet of a larval cell must make a DC 15 Reflex save to avoid becoming infested with the larvae. A creature that becomes infested must make a successful DC 15 Fortitude save each round to avoid taking 1d2 points of Constitution damage and falling asleep-additional Constitution damage from feeding larvae does not wake sleeping victims. Feeding larvae can be detached from the creature they cling to by cutting them off with a slashing weapon (which requires a DC 20 Heal check that deals 1d4 points of damage per larva attached) or by dealing cold damage to the larvae at any time, which also deals half damage to the creature the larvae are covering. Remove disease or a similar effect kills any thriae larvae on the host.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Merope Consumption (Su) Three times per day as a standard action, a thriae seer can consume a dose of merope in order to further tap into her spiritual powers for 1d6+3 rounds. Starting on the round after she consumes the merope, the thriae seer gains an insight bonus to her AC and on damage done with melee attacks equal to her Wisdom modifier (+6 for most thriae seers). Mind Sting (Su) A target stung by a thriae seer becomes confused for 1d4 rounds unless it makes a successful DC 21 Will save. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Sought after for their wisdom and guidance as well as their enchanting beauty, thriae seers are among the most spiritually gifted members of their colony. Their prowess for foretelling the future and deciding upon the soundest courses of action in dire situations earns them respect from other thriae as well as outsiders from other societies, and seers wield their gift with a stoic humbleness. Nonetheless, most seers expect an offering before they will grant an audience a divination. These offerings usually consist of ornate jewelry and sums of gold, though some seers desire the company of humanoid male or female consorts, many of whom gladly oblige the captivating seer with their presence. While their combative abilities mainly comprise their magical powers and they appear at first glance to be thin and frail, seers still possess the trademark strength and resilience of all thriae. Thriae seers spend most of their time meditating in one of the many chambers in the colony's hive dedicated to such activities. Consuming large amounts of their queen's merope to enhance their powers of divination, seers ponder the best solutions to their colony's problems, and often act as a sort of spiritual political council for the queen. If a particularly wealthy group of outsiders has sought the counsel of several thriae seers, this council of prophetesses will combine their powers in order to read a difficult divination. Thriae seers are 6 feet from head to toe and weigh 150 pounds. The thriae seer presented here represents the least of her kind. Many thriae seers take levels of monk or rogue so as to be even more adept at protecting their queen. Thriae oracles and sorcerers are also relatively common-such thriae are particularly valued by their hive for their magical abilities.</Description>

As a free action, a thriae soldier can apply her venom to an arrow as she fires the shot. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The guardians of the thriae colony and its treasures, thriae soldiers make up the backbone of a hive's defenses. Whether patrolling the perimeter of the hive or protecting its queen and seers from attackers, soldiers are a crucial asset ensuring a colony's survival, and so it makes sense that they compose the majority of thriae populations. While not as spiritually powerful as their seer and queen kin, soldiers possess remarkable agility and skill with the bow. Guards remain stationed in pairs outside doors to important areas, such as the meditation chambers of seers and the enormous private quarters of the queen, and when their duties take them outside the walls of the hive, they travel in large convoys. A thriae soldier's stinger carries within it especially potent venom similar to that of giant bees, and the soldier can easily apply this poison to her weapons. While most soldiers carry bows, they are also trained at an early age with a multitude of both melee and ranged weapons, and some prefer the feel of a sword or hammer. Regardless of the type, all thriae weapons and armors are expertly crafted, made of steel and gilded with intricate decorations of gold and amber-hued gems. Thriae soldiers are often talented artisans as well as warriors, and most create their own weapons to bear in combat. Since there are exponentially more soldiers than seers in any given colony, thriae queens ration merope sparingly to soldiers, whose use of it doesn't provoke the divine insight cherished by thriae culture, but rather inspires courage and brute strength on the battlefield. When a thriae soldier consumes merope, her reflexes quicken, her wits sharpen, and she gains a second wind, so most individuals save their rationed doses for times of dire need. When circumstances are especially grim, commanders of thriae militias will order all of their troops to consume their merope at once, giving the company the final burst of strength it needs to turn the tide of battle. Thriae soldiers are heavier-set than most of their slender thriae sisters, and average individuals weigh about 200 pounds and measure 6 feet from head to toe.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Hands of War (Su) Any weapon a hekatonkheires wields gains a +3 enhancement bonus while the titan holds it. A hekatonkheires's attacks are treated as epic and evil for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. In addition, a hekatonkheires's multitude of arms allows it to effectively block attacks, granting it a +8 armor bonus to its AC. Hundred-Handed Whirlwind (Ex) A hekatonkheires carries several dozen weapons of various types in its hundred hands, but when it attacks in melee, you don't have to resolve each of these as a separate attack. Instead, when the titan attacks with its weapons, it rolls its attacks normally (either one attack for a standard action, or four as a full-round action) and hits every creature in its reach each time an attack roll exceeds that creature's AC. If any such attack roll results in a possible critical hit, the critical is applied to one creature of the hekatonkheires's choosing. The hekatonkheires can choose to deal bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage as a free action on each separate hit. Planar Leap (Su) A hekatonkheires traverses the planes by physically smashing through planar boundaries and crashing devastatingly into the target plane itself. Once per year as a full-round action, a hekatonkheires can, as part of a jump, plane shift to any other plane (as per the spell of the same name). It can only bring itself and its gear when it travels in this manner. When the hekatonkheires reaches its destination plane, it falls from the sky and crashes to the ground, creating a devastating explosion of thunder and fire. Any creature within 300 feet of the point where the hekatonkheires lands (including the titan itself ) takes 20d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 20d6 points of sonic damage (Reflex DC 38 for half ). The save DC is Constitution-based. Stunning Slam (Ex) As a standard action, a hekatonkheires may forgo any weapon attacks to make a single slam attack against any creature in reach. If it hits, the target takes damage and must succeed at a DC 41 Fortitude save to avoid being stunned for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Strength-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Horrifying abominations shunned by the gods immediately upon their creation, the hekatonkheires are perhaps the most powerful and devastating race of titans in existence. When the titans-envious of the gods' divine strength- rebelled against the deities, the hekatonkheires were among the first to pick up arms, weary of the scorn their own creators felt for them. The betrayal of the Elysian titans led to the hekatonkheires' swift capture by the gods, who found the hekatonkheires' power to be so immense that they were not banished to the Abyss with their Thanatotic brethren. Instead, the gods cast the hekatonkheires into the furthest reaches of the multiverse they could find. There, the hekatonkheires drifted in expanses of nothingness for unknown eons, and the madness wrought upon them by isolation destroyed their memories. Yet from their madness these shattered monstrosities spawned progeny to replace them in their pursuit to destroy, and some of these monstrous offspring discovered ways to break through planar boundaries and wander the multiverse freely. The gods initially created only three hekatonkheires, seeking to make the ultimate warriors in order to guard the gates to the Abyss. These three ancient titans still drift in the unknown expanses between planes-the hekatonkheires that now walk the worlds are their lesser spawn. But these so-called "lesser" titans remain almost unimaginably powerful themselves. They have no knowledge of why their forgotten ancestors were originally banished, and so they wander in search of answers, all the while destroying entire worlds. They are warped engines of mayhem, their existence based wholly on the devastation of life and anything that might remind them of their age-old war against the gods, having inherited only the haunting ghosts of such memories from their ancestors. Those hekatonkheires who have emerged back into the multiverse have done so in different realms, and to date, no record of any two of these spawn meeting one another exists. It is fortunate that only one hekatonkheires is encountered on a world at any given time, as even scholars cannot fathom the power that would arise out of two or more of the titans' collective strength. They traverse the planes alone, caring not for allies of any sort until they can remember what their purpose was when they were born eons ago. Though hekatonkheires are as intelligent as the rest of their titan relatives, they wander with such destructive and seemingly mindless intentions that they spare no time in communicating with other creatures, especially those that would beg for mercy. The hekatonkheires were created to destroy, and so that is all they desire to do; the crushing blows of their fists and the goring slashes of their weapons speak for themselves. They serve no master, and halt their otherwise endless rampage only if called by their true names, which few-if any-mortals know. Those that do know these names speak them only in whispers, for their mere utterance seems to carry with it immeasurable power. A hekatonkheires can only be called via mighty spells such as gate if a conjurer knows the plane the titan is currently on, and only if the conjurer knows the true name of the hekatonkheires it is seeking to call. Only the mad or depraved would dare such a feat, however, as the might of one of these unique goliaths is so massive that the being cannot be controlled, and even if it is banished back to the realm from whence it came, it is never long before the hekatonkheires sets its sights on the world it visited so brief ly, if only to sate its lust for destroying it. Each hekatonkheires has 50 heads and 100 arms so that one is never caught off guard. The stones that it hurls with its 100 hands are as big as boulders, and those who have seen a hekatonkheires hurl such rocks and lived to tell the tale have said that it is as though an entire mountain is falling from the sky. In addition to their unworldly strength, hekatonkheires are known for their awesome control over the powers of lightning and thunder, and an individual hekatonkheires's arrival is often prefaced by an abrupt and tumultuous storm in the area. Like all titans, hekatonkheires are immortal, and do not die unless they are slain. A hekatonkheires is 50 feet tall and weighs 25 tons.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Ink Cloud (Ex) A tojanida can emit a 30-foot-radius sphere of ink once per minute as a free action. The ink provides total concealment in water, and persists for 1 minute. If used out of the water, the jet of ink is a line 30 feet long, and creatures in the area must succeed at a DC 16 Reflex save or be blinded for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Tojanidas are bizarre natives from the Plane of Water that resemble mixes between monstrous crabs and enormous snapping turtles. Originally elemental beings of water, tojanidas were bound into their strange forms long ago for unclear reasons, and no longer know how they might eventually return to their pure and formless state. Determined to preserve their pride, the grotesque tojanidas ply the waters of the planes seeking hedonistic pleasures- especially culinary ones-and the adoration of other races. Loquacious when addressed with the proper respect, they make excellent heralds and emissaries for more powerful beings, and often enjoy posing as such even when operating on their own. When riled, however, tojanidas make fearsome opponents, violent and eager juggernauts with snapping jaws and clacking pincers. Adult tojanidas are roughly 6 feet long and weigh several hundred pounds. When threatened, a tojanida can retract its limbs most of the way into its shell, which is an irremovable part of its body. The ring of eyes completely encircling the tojanida's shell along its rim makes the creature extremely difficult to catch by surprise. While tojanidas adore eating, as they find flavor and texture to be two of the most fascinating senses, they don't actually need to consume food, instead drawing sustenance directly from the currents of arcane energy all around them via the magic of their shells. Blessed (some might say cursed) with extremely long racial memories, tojanidas wander the oceans and lakes of innumerable worlds, attempting to find unusual physical pleasures or conversation capable of distracting them from the insufferable ennui and apathy born of remembering their ancestors' experiences. Though the tojanidas themselves may not appreciate the burden of memory, adventurers and scholars often seek the use of a tojanida's recalled lore.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Conductive (Ex) Anytime a tophet is affected by an effect that deals fire damage, determine how much damage the construct would have taken if it were not immune to fire. Creatures currently swallowed whole by the construct take fire damage equal to half of this amount. Swallow Whole (Ex) Once swallowed by a tophet, an opponent takes no damage, but is trapped inside the creature's hollow interior. The construct's maw locks down, preventing creatures from climbing back out. A creature can attempt to hack or smash its way out as normal, but a tophet's stomach has hit points equal to one-tenth its actual hit points plus its bonus hit points for being a construct (totalling 40 hit points for most tophets). Alternatively, a swallowed creature can attempt to pick the lock on the iron hatch in the tophet's stomach by making a DC 30 Disable Device check. If a creature exits by picking the lock, the tophet closes its hatch and can swallow whole again. These locks can also be picked from the outside, but only after the tophet is slain. A Large tophet's belly can hold 1 Medium creature at a time.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Known in some lands as furnace guards or iron gluttons, tophets have long served in the palaces and prisons of tyrants as vigilant sentinels and dreaded punishments. Appearing as rotund iron statues, often bearing the caricatured visages of past kings or dishonored nobles, these constructs all possess yawning maws, capable of easily gobbling up smaller creatures. Upon consuming a victim, the animate statue becomes a walking prison, holding its victim within with little chance for escape. The iron statue can then return its victim to the proper cell, the feet of its lord, or any other fate its creator determines. In the most feared case, tophets capture or are fed prisoners, then wander out into the desert heat or even rivers of molten rock, where their interiors attain hellish temperatures, torturing and often outright killing those trapped within. Tophets are often assembled in groups of up to a dozen, where cruel rulers incarcerate traitors and other criminals. Mindless creatures capable only of obeying their masters' whims, these unthinking constructs make incorruptible guardians and are endlessly loyal. Tophets stand 10 feet tall and weigh 3,000 pounds. CONSTRUCTION A tophet's hollow body is made of 3,000 pounds of iron or steel forged in heats comparable to those found in active volcanoes. Tophets can be made of other metals as well, such as bronze or cold iron. TOPHET CL 12th; Price 45,000 gp CONSTRUCTION Requirements Craft Construct, bull's strength, endure elements, creator must be CL 12th; Skill Craft (sculptures) DC 20; Cost 22,500 gp.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>All-Seeing Attacks (Ex) A jotund troll can make nine additional attacks of opportunity in a round, one for each head, although no more than a single attack for any given opportunity. Cacophonous Roar (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a jotund troll can emit a cacophonous roar from its nine heads. All creatures within a 60-foot spread of the troll must make a DC 19 Will save or become confused for 1d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. Multiple Minds (Ex) A jotund troll has nine different minds that are in constant communication with each other. The resulting jumble of tangled thoughts grants the troll a +4 racial bonus on all Will saving throws against mind-affecting effects. In addition, whenever a jotund troll must make a Will save, it can roll the saving throw twice and take the better of the two results as its actual saving throw.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Jotund trolls are gigantic, nine-headed horrors. Prowling frigid moors and marshes, these rapacious creatures have the same insatiable appetites of common trolls but require much more sustenance because of their excessive size. Jotund trolls stand 30 feet tall and weigh roughly 25,000 pounds. They can live for up to 100 years. The jotund troll's nine heads each have their own brains and senses, but they share, after a fashion, the same mind. Despite this, a jotund troll's heads often argue and bicker, particularly over which head gets to eat. The fact that all nine maws lead to the same shared stomach makes little difference in such culinary disagreements. Jotund trolls spawn with either their own kind or with other trolls. In the latter case, there is only a 5% chance the offspring will be a jotund troll. Apart from brief mating periods, jotund trolls are solitary, although some cull together bands of other giants into devastating war parties that can lay waste to entire regions.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Fear of Fire (Ex) A moss troll is shaken as long as it is within 30 feet of a visible fire or an open flame of at least torch size. Tree Climber (Ex) When climbing trees and other foliage, a moss troll's climb speed increases to 30 feet. If a moss troll falls while climbing in trees, it ignores the first 30 feet it falls for the purposes of calculating total damage from the fall. While climbing in trees, a moss troll gains a +4 racial bonus on initiative checks.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Moss trolls are bent and gangly creatures. They are smaller and thinner than normal trolls, yet their arms are unusually long and spindly for the creatures' size. Their flesh supports the growth of moss and mold as surely as tree bark. Although their appetites are notoriously powerful, moss trolls are sly killers rather than simple brutes. They travel in the trees, singing, climbing, and jumping with unnerving ease. When a moss troll spots prey, it reaches or leaps down from above, heedless of dropping great distances in its eagerness to sate its ravenous appetite. Moss trolls are fearless except in the face of fire, which does not stop a hungry moss troll from attacking, but can often cause a wounded one to retreat. However, those who fight moss trolls may be unpleasantly surprised to learn that acid has no special effect on a moss troll's regeneration. Moss trolls not only hunt from the trees, but also live, breed, and hide their treasure among the branches. Their weirdly long arms allow them to attack foes on the ground without ever needing to set foot on the earth themselves. Young moss trolls are adept at climbing and acrobatics, as much as they are at eating and killing. Like other trolls, adult moss trolls often drive juveniles away after training them to hunt and fight. Gangs and troops of moss trolls exist only where food is plentiful. While moss trolls can digest almost any organic material, they prefer fresh meat-particularly when said meat is served still alive and squirming after a particularly invigorating session of stalking and torture. A moss troll is 9 feet tall and weighs 550 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Disease (Ex) A trollhound's saliva is an infectious brew of contagion. Creatures bitten by a trollhound are often afflicted with bloodfire fever, a disease characterized by deep internal pain, as if the victim's blood were on fire. Additional symptoms include loss of muscular coordination, pus-filled blisters, and overall lethargy and fatigue. Trolls and trollhounds alike are immune to bloodfire fever, even though trollhounds often exhibit the pus-filled blisters that come with the disease. Bloodfire fever: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 14; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d3 Str damage, 1d3 Dex damage, and target is fatigued; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Slavering and voracious, trollhounds seem to be trolls in smaller canine form, and indeed, are often found as pets among gangs and tribes of trolls. Requiring vast amounts of food to fuel their regenerative metabolisms, packs of wild trollhounds range far and wide through the mountains of the north, their ravenous hunger driving them to hunt and consume any prey they can track down and kill. A typical trollhound stands 4 feet tall at the shoulder, has short but powerful legs, and weighs around 350 pounds. A trollhound's skin is somewhat scaly, with patches of rough, greenish-black fur. It has oversized jaws with a pronounced underbite, and its eyes are normally a dull, hateful orange. Trollhounds are believed to be the outcome of infusing particularly ferocious worgs with alchemically prepared troll blood. The resulting beast loses the worg's wicked intelligence but gains the ability to regenerate even the most grievous wounds, except those inf licted by fire or acid. Whatever their origin, trollhounds breed true and are often raised by trolls. Trollhounds are fearless on the hunt and in combat, relying on their ability to regenerate to carry them through. Not even the threat of fire is enough to repel them, as the beasts are too dull to recognize the danger it poses. Nevertheless, fire is one of the most effective tools in combating trollhounds, and canny hunters know to burn every last remnant of a slain trollhound, for as is true of trolls, even the smallest piece of trollhound flesh can eventually regrow back into a full-sized beast. Trollhounds are most often found in the company of trolls, who breed the beasts as hunters, guards, pets, and food. Trollhounds seem to have an affinity for their savage masters, and tamed trollhounds always regard trolls as alpha members of the pack. A trollhound will never attack a troll without cause-although trolls often enjoy violent roughhousing with these creatures nonetheless.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Scrimshaw Magic (Sp) When a tupilaq is created, its creator can inscribe a single spell he knows (as long as that spell is no higher than 2nd level and requires no material components) into the tupilaq as a complex scrimshaw design. The tupilaq gains the ability to use that spell as a spell-like ability (CL 7th) three times per day. The tupilaq's creator can inscribe a new spell onto the tupilaq if he wishes, replacing the previous scrimshaw. Inscribing a new scrimshaw requires 24 hours of work and an expenditure of 500 gp in materials. The tupilaq presented here utilizes invisibility in this manner. Erase can destroy a tupilaq's scrimshaw if it fails a Fortitude save against the spell. If a tupilaq's scrimshaw is removed in this manner, it loses access to the spell as a spell-like ability, and seeks out its creator to attack and kill him. The tupilaq's creator becomes the target of the tupilaq's seek target ability in this case. If a tupilaq's creator is already dead, the tupilaq instead seeks out the nearest living creature and attacks this new target on sight, continuing this spree of murder until it is itself destroyed. Seek Target (Su) A tupilaq's creator can place a drop of blood, lock of hair, or other portion of a creature's body in the tupilaq's maw as a standard action. From that point on, the tupilaq constantly knows what direction that creature is located in, and gains a +20 insight bonus on all Perception checks made to locate the creature. A new target cannot be assigned to a tupilaq in this manner until its previous target is dead. Shearing Jaws (Ex) All tupilaqs are crafted with oversized jaws capable of tearing and pulling. A tupilaq applies twice its Strength modifier to damage with a successful bite attack and threatens a critical hit on a roll of 19-20. A tupilaq is treated as Large for all checks made to move a grappled opponent.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Tupilaqs are small constructs crafted out of whale bones and whale teeth for the sole purpose of murdering the creator's enemies. A tupilaq's appearance can vary based on its construction, but all have prominent jaws and a small body with hands and feet fit for swimming. A tupilaq usually stands 3 feet tall and weighs only 30 pounds. Tupilaqs must be created in secrecy-if any other person discovers the tupilaq is being created, the attempt to build the construct immediately fails. As part of its creation, the creator invites or lures a host spirit to possess the tupilaq. Most often, the animus of a tupilaq is that of a dead child or other small humanoid, and the parity of size between the new vessel and the spirit's previous body is what gives the creature a speed and agility on land and in water that is atypical for most constructs. This trapped spirit is also what makes a tupilaq so savage and murderous. CONSTRUCTION A tupilaq is built from 30 pounds of whale bones, bound together with sinew. When the creature's creation is complete, the sinew falls away and the bones fuse together to create the animated creature. TUPILAQ CL 8th; Price 21,000 gp CONSTRUCTION Requirements Craft Construct, geas/quest, keen edge, locate creature, creator must be caster level 8th, creation must be done in complete secrecy; Skill Craft (scrimshaw) DC 20; Cost 10,500 gp</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Eclipse (Su) Anytime a tzitzimitl casts deeper darkness, any creatures in the area of darkness when it is created take 8d6 points of cold damage (DC 31 Fortitude for half). Any creature that takes damage from this effect becomes staggered as long as it remains in the area of darkness and for 1d4 rounds after it leaves that area. The save DC is Charisma-based. Eye Beam (Su) As a standard action, a tzitzimitl can fire a glowing beam of force from its eyes at a range of 100 feet as a ranged touch attack dealing 10d6 points of force damage and 10d6 points of electricity damage. Light to Dark (Su) As an immediate action up to three times per day, a tzitzimitl can convert a positive energy effect that affects it into negative energy. Doing so transforms the entire effect, such that it affects other creatures as well. A tzitzimitl can transform channeled positive energy in this way even if the positive energy would not otherwise harm it.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Enigmatic creatures of darkness, some cultures claim tzitzimitls attack and consume entire suns to "shut down worlds" in preparation for the end of days. Sages say that these creatures come from the cold, dark places between the stars, and that in the darkness of any eclipse, one can see their immense, world-darkening shadows. Some claim ancient and forgotten deities of death and destruction created the first tzitzimitls as instruments of apocalypse, while others speculate they come from faraway worlds where immense planets teem with creatures of this scale, and that the immortal dead of these dark globes are banished to other worlds to spread devastation. Tzitzimitls as a whole offer neither affirmation nor denial for these claims, and in fact seem to glory in such legends. Certainly, the arrival of a tzitzimitl upon a world heralds the advent of a time of great trouble, although whether or not the tzitzimitl actually presages such dark times or is the cause of them is a matter of debate. On some planets, tzitzimitls have already arrived, yet they lie dormant in ancient tombs, imprisoned ages ago by heroes who are long forgotten today. A tzitzimitl is 50 feet tall.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Battle Trained (Ex) A valkyrie is proficient with all armor. Armor never impacts a valkyrie's speed, nor does a valkyrie take armor check penalties on Ride checks. Choose the Slain (Su) A valkyrie can draw the soul from a newly dead body and store it in her spear for transport to the Outer Planes. This functions as soul bind, but the dead creature must be willing to have its soul taken. If the creature is unwilling, this ability has no effect. Holy Zeal (Su) A valkyrie adds her Charisma modifier as a deflection bonus to her Armor Class.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Valkyries are outsiders who scour the battlefields of the Material Plane for warriors of great prowess and legendary renown. With a glance, a valkyrie can tell who is near death and ready to give up life and who fights on to live another day, and can either claim the soul of the slain or aid the living to continue the fight. Valkyries are always female, and appear as strong and beautiful human, dwarven, or elven women. A human valkyrie is 6 feet tall and weighs close to 200 pounds. Valkyries serve a variety of deities, though they are most often associated with the gods of war, conf lict, valor, and courage. Although capable combatants in their own right, valkyries are almost always encountered mounted, typically on flying steeds such as dragon horses, pegasi, or sleipnirs.</Description>

    <Description>Jiang-shis (often known as "hopping vampires") are undead humanoid creatures that feed on the exhaled life energy of the living. A jiang-shi's appearance is based on the state of the creature's corpse at the time of its reanimation. Regardless of the state of decay, most jiang-shis wear clothing or armor that is at least one generation out of style. Additionally, each has a short parchment prayer scroll affixed to its brow by stitches; originally intended to protect the body from restless spirits, this scroll grants a jiang-shi immunity to magical effects unleashed by items like scrolls and wands. A jiang-shi is created when a restless spirit does not leave its corpse at the time of death, and is instead allowed to fester and putrefy within. At some point during the body's decomposition, the thing rises in its grotesque form and seeks living creatures to feed upon. CREATING A JIANG-SHI "Jiang-shi" is an acquired template that can be added to any living creature with 5 or more Hit Dice (referred to hereafter as the base creature). Most jiang-shis were once humans, but any creature that undergoes specific rites can acquire the template. A jiang-shi uses the base creature's stats and abilities except as noted here. CR: Same as the base creature +2. Alignment: Any evil. Type: The creature's type changes to undead (augmented). Do not recalculate class Hit Dice, BAB, or saves. Senses: A jiang-shi vampire gains darkvision 60 feet. It also gains the ability to sense the breathing of living creatures-a jiang-shi has blindsight to a range of 60 feet against creatures that breathe. A creature may hold its breath to prevent a jiang-shi from noticing it in this manner. Armor Class: Natural armor improves by +2. Hit Dice: Change all racial Hit Dice to d8s. Class Hit Dice are unaffected. As undead, jiang-shis use their Charisma modifier to determine bonus hit points (instead of Constitution). Defensive Abilities: A jiang-shi gains channel resistance +4, DR 10/magic and slashing, and resistance to cold 20, in addition to all of the defensive abilities granted by the undead type. A jiang-shi also gains fast healing 5. In addition, all jiang-shis gain the following defensive ability. Prayer Scroll (Su): The scroll attached to the brow of a jiang-shi grants immunity to any effects generated from spell-completion or spell-trigger magic items, such as scrolls and wands. Such magical effects treat the jiang-shi as if it had unbeatable spell resistance. A jiang-shi‘s prayer scroll can be removed with a successful steal combat maneuver (Advanced Player's Guide 322), which immediately ends the jiang-shi's immunity to these effects. If a jiang-shi's prayer scroll is destroyed (a standard action), the vampire also loses its fast healing ability. A jiang-shi may create a replacement prayer scroll by using any strip of parchment and a writing instrument, but doing so requires 10 minutes of uninterrupted work. Weaknesses: Jiang-shis recoil from mirrors or the sound of handbells rung within 10 feet of them. Cooked rice, which to jiang-shis mocks the fundamental fact that they no longer eat food, shames them into recoiling as well. These things don't harm a jiang-shi vampire-they merely keep it at bay for a period of time. A recoiling jiang-shi vampire must stay at least 5 feet away from the object of its revulsion, and cannot touch or make melee attacks against a creature brandishing the object during that round. Holding a jiang-shi vampire at bay takes a standard action. After being held at bay for 1 round, a jiang-shi vampire can attempt to overcome its revulsion of the object and function normally each round it makes a DC 20 Will save at the start of its turn. Destroying a Jiang-Shi: If reduced to 0 hit points, a jiang-shi vampire crumbles to dust but is not destroyed. It reforms in 1 minute with 1 hit point in the same space, or the nearest unoccupied space. Scattering the dust before the jiang-shi reforms destroys it permanently, as does mixing rice into the dust with a dose of holy water. Jiang-shi vampires are also susceptible to wooden weapons carved from peach trees, as such weapons represent the unity of all elements and life to these creatures. A wooden weapon carved from a peach tree automatically bypasses a jiang-shi vampire's damage reduction. Additionally, any successful hit from such a weapon that reduces a jiang-shi to 0 hit points immediately destroys the creature. Although they normally retreat from daylight, jiang-shi vampires are not destroyed by sunlight like regular vampires and can move around during the day without harm. Speed: A jiang-shi moves only by hopping. This mode of movement is somewhat less swift than regular movement, and thus a jiang-shi's base speed is reduced by 10 feet from the base creature's speed, to a minimum of 10 feet. This unusual mode of movement allows the jiang-shi to ignore the effects of difficult terrain on movement, and makes it impossible to trip. Other speeds (like fly or swim speeds) are not affected by this reduction. Melee: A jiang-shi gains a bite attack and 2 claw attacks if the base creature didn't have them. Damage for the bite attack depends on the jiang-shi's size, but its claw attacks do damage as a creature two size categories larger. For a Medium jiang-shi, a bite attack deals 1d6 points of damage and a claw attack deals 1d8 points of damage. A jiang-shi's claws are even more dangerous than this, though-see the "brutal claws" special attack below. A jiang-shi's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Special Attacks: A jiang-shi gains several special attacks. Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 the jiang-shi's Hit Dice + the jiang-shi's Charisma modifier unless otherwise noted. Brutal Claws (Ex): A jiang-shi's nails are brutally sharp and can extend and retract at will. They threaten a critical hit on a roll of 19-20 and grant the grab ability. A jiang-shi with monk levels gains this enhanced critical threat range and grab ability with its unarmed attacks, and uses its unarmed monk damage or its claw damage, whichever is higher, when making such attacks. Drain Chi (Su): Instead of draining blood, a jiang-shi vampire drains "chi," or life energy, from a victim's breath. When a jiang-shi makes a successful grapple check (in addition to any other effects caused by a successful check, including additional damage), the jiang-shi can attempt to drain chi by drinking the victim's breath. The victim can resist this attack by making a successful Fortitude save. On a failed save, the victim gains 1 negative level and is staggered for 1d4 rounds. Ability Scores: Str +4, Dex +6, Int +2, Wis +4, Cha +2. As an undead creature, a jiang-shi has no Constitution score. Feats: Jiang-shis gain Alertness, Dodge, Mobility, Skill Focus (Acrobatics), and Spring Attack as bonus feats. Skills: Jiang-shis gain a +8 racial bonus on Acrobatics, Perception, and Stealth checks.</Description>

    <Description>Vanaras are intelligent, simian humanoids who live in deep forests and jungles. They are both agile and clever, but saddled with boundless curiosity and a love of pranks that, while normally harmless, hinder ingratiations with those they encounter. A vanara's body is covered in a thin coat of soft fur, and individuals with chestnut, ivory, and even golden coats are common. Despite its fur, a vanara can grow lengthy hair on its head just like a human, and both male and female vanaras take pains to wear elaborate hairstyles for important social functions. The hair on a vanara's head matches the color of its fur. All vanaras have long, prehensile tails and handlike feet capable of well-articulated movements. A vanara stands slightly shorter than a typical human. Males weigh from 150 to 200 pounds at most, with females weighing slightly less. Vanaras live for 60 to 75 years. Vanaras live in large, tree-top villages connected by rope-bridges and ladders. Homes are carved out of trees but usually left open to the elements except for woven leaf canopies and overhangs. Vanara villages are typically led by the community's religious leader-usually a cleric, oracle, or monk. VANARA CHARACTERS Vanaras are defined by their class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. All vanaras have the following racial traits. +2 Dexterity, +2 Wisdom, -2 Charisma: Vanaras are agile and insightful, but are also rather mischievous. Climb Speed: Vanaras have a climb speed of 20 feet. Low-Light Vision: Vanaras can see twice as far as a human in conditions of dim light. Nimble: Vanaras have a +2 racial bonus on Acrobatics and Stealth checks. Prehensile Tail: See above. Languages: A vanara begins play speaking both Common and Vanaran. Vanaras with high Int scores can choose from among the following bonus languages: Aklo, Celestial, Elven, Gnome, Goblin, and Sylvan.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Poison Use (Ex) Vishkanyas are skilled with poison and never accidentally poison themselves when using or applying poison. Toxic (Ex) A number of times per day equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum 1/day), a vishkanya can envenom a weapon that it wields with its toxic saliva or blood (using blood requires the vishkanya to be injured when it uses this ability). Applying venom in this way is a swift action. Vishkanya Venom: Injury; save Fort DC 10 + 1/2 the vishkanya's Hit Dice + the vishkanya's Constitution modifier; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Dex; cure 1 save.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Vishkanyas are a race of exotic humanoids known for their guile and affinity for poisons of all kinds. A vishkanya's flesh is made up of fine scales that from a distance of even a few feet look just like particularly smooth skin. These scales are usually a single dark color, although some of them have complex patterns like stripes or even spirals. A vishkanya's tongue is forked like a serpent's tongue, and its eyes lack visible pupils. Although legends abound that the merest touch from a vishkanya can slay a mortal humanoid, these tales are patently false. A vishkanya's skin is no more poisonous than that of any human, but it is true that their blood, spit, and other bodily fluids can be dangerous. Vishkanyas are skilled in using their own spittle or even their blood to envenom their weapons, and those who fight them should be wary of exposure to the vishkanya's poison. A vishkanya is 6 feet tall and weighs 130 pounds. VISHKANYA CHARACTERS Vishkanyas are defined by their class levels- they do not possess racial Hit Dice. Vishkanyas have the following racial traits. +2 Dexterity, +2 Charisma, -2 Wisdom: Vishkanyas are graceful and elegant, but often irrational. Low-Light Vision: Vishkanyas can see twice as far as humans in conditions of dim light. Keen Senses: Vishkanyas receive a +2 racial bonus on Perception checks. Limber: Vishkanyas gain a +2 racial bonus on Escape Artist and Stealth checks. Poison Resistance: A vishkanya has a racial bonus on saves against poison equal to its Hit Dice. Poison Use: See above. Toxic: See above. Weapon Familiarity: Vishkanyas are always prof icient with blowguns, kukri, and shuriken. Languages: Vishkanyas begin play speaking Common and Vishkanya. Vishkanyas with high Intelligence scores can choose any of the following bonus languages: Aklo, Draconic, Elven, Goblin, Sylvan, and Undercommon.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Suffocating Water (Su) Once per day as a standard action, a vodyanoi can cause the water surrounding it up to a radius of 30 feet to grow thick and slimy, making it difficult for water-breathing creatures within the area other than vodyanois to breathe. A vodyanoi can control narrow currents of breathable water to provide oxygen to up to 3 other creatures in the area of effect-vodyanois themselves are immune to this effect. All other creatures in an area of suffocating water must hold their breath or risk suffocation. Once created, an area of suffocating water does not move-it persists for a number of minutes equal to the vodyanoi's Hit Dice. The slimy water does not impact swim speeds or visibility in any significant manner. A creature can make a DC 20 Perception check to notice the difference between suffocating water and any normal water that may surround it.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Vodyanois resemble humanoid salamanders. They have short noses, bulging eyes, and broad mouths covered with thickets of fleshy tendrils. Skin color varies wildly depending on the climate and terrain, from drab greens and grays to vibrant oranges and reds. Vodyanois stand roughly 5-1/2 feet tall and weigh just over 100 pounds. They can live up to 120 years. Vodyanois are well known as enemies to boggards- another amphibious race often encountered in proximity to vodyanoi lands. While vodyanois themselves are rarely evil, they are capricious and often quick to anger, particularly when they feel their territories have been intruded upon. Their hatred of boggards is another sure way to arouse their anger-a vodyanoi who suspects one of boggard collusion will often attack on sight. Those who live in close proximity to vodyanoi tribes learn quickly to leave the folk alone, and when visits or intrusions into vodyanoi lands are necessary (such as when one might need to seek out a vodyanoi for aid in curing a disease), gifts of magic potions and exotic fruits are highly recommended.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Blood-Freezing Howl (Su) As a standard action, a voonith can unleash a bloodcurdling howl. All creatures within a 30-foot-radius burst must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or become dazed for 1 round and then shaken for an additional 1d6 rounds. Any creature that makes a successful save against a voonith's howl is immune to the same voonith's howl for 24 hours. This is a sonic mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Cunning and aggressive, vooniths are amphibious nocturnal predators with voracious appetites and mild intelligence. A voonith's howl is said to freeze the blood and is more than capable of stopping a creature in its tracks. Vooniths usually howl when they see prey too far away from the water's edge to ambush. While the vooniths are native to the strange Dimension of Dream, many have found their way out of that realm and into the waking world to take up lairs in the swampy fens and remote coastlines of the world. How the vooniths originally managed to make this transition between worlds is unclear. Although they look like little more than wild beasts, vooniths are actually rather intelligent. While certainly not as sharp as the average human, a voonith is smart enough to know how to speak and often does so with others of its kind. Vooniths do not often choose to communicate with other creatures, giving rise to the misconception that they're little more than dumb animals, but on occasion, travelers in swampy regions tell tales of overhearing strange piping voices speaking among the reeds. Those few who know the secrets of the Aklo tongue can understand these words, although understanding of what the vooniths whisper in the night when they think no one else can hear is not always for the best. While not evil, vooniths have a decidedly dark sense of humor, and take great pleasure in concocting violent poems or grisly jokes. Punch lines in which non-voonith creatures-particularly humans, cats, and gnomes- meet gory and ironic fates are the most entertaining to vooniths. Some tales speak of canny travelers who, with the ability to speak Aklo, manage to strike up unlikely conversations with lurking vooniths. In truth, vooniths are quite social, and when one breeches the awkwardness arising from interspecies conf lict, a friendship with a voonith can be an unexpected reward. Vooniths who befriend travelers often escort them, quietly and unseen, through dangerous bogs, and when such travelers fall prey to other dangers of the swamp, a friendly voonith will provide what aid it can. Vooniths are 4 feet long and weigh 70 pounds, yet rumors tell of vooniths that have grown to much larger sizes than this.</Description>

    <Description>Though related to raptors and other birds of prey, vultures mainly feed on carrion they spot or scent from on high. Vultures have weak claws compared to predatory birds, but their sharp and wickedly hooked beaks tear living flesh as readily as the sharpest blade. Despite dining on carrion, vultures prefer their corpses newly dead rather than rotten. Some even hunt smaller prey when food is scarce.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Diseased (Ex) Due to their filthy eating habits and constant exposure to decaying flesh, giant vultures are harbingers of disease-much more so than the standard vulture. Any creature bitten by a giant vulture has a 10% chance of being exposed to filth fever, blinding sickness, or a similar disease (Core Rulebook 557). Once this check is made, a victim can no longer be infected by this particular giant vulture, though attacks by different giant vultures are resolved normally and may result in multiple illnesses. While vultures aren't immune to all diseases, they do gain a +4 racial bonus on all saving throws against such ailments.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Larger even than condors, giant vultures dwell only in regions where carrion is both large and plentiful, such as the primeval wildernesses where megafauna roam. They also flock to regions torn by war, feasting on the dead with no concern for allegiance or race. Giant vultures rarely wait for wounded creatures to finish dying before they feed, and are much braver than most wild animals. A giant vulture, for example, wouldn't think twice about swooping down on a heavily armored column of soldiers just to snatch up a few wounded stragglers from the end of the line. A giant vulture stands more than 13 feet tall, has a wingspan of over 30 feet, and weighs 500 to 600 pounds.

    <SpecialAbilities>Corpse Lure (Ex) By setting a corpse atop its stump and riddling the body with small, extruded filaments, a wolf-in-sheep's-clothing can crudely maneuver the corpse, manipulating it like a puppet. The corpse cannot leave the stump or perform complex actions, but is instead used to lure larger prey within range of the wolf-in-sheep's-clothing's tentacles. The largest corpse a wolf-in-sheep's-clothing can manipulate in this fashion is two size categories smaller than itself (thus Tiny creatures for a Medium wolf-in-sheep's-clothing). When a wolf-in-sheep's-clothing uses a corpse like this, it gains a +8 bonus on Disguise checks beyond its normal racial bonus. Implant (Ex) A wolf-in-sheep's-clothing can infest a creature with its eggs in one of two ways. A creature that eats a carcass used by the monster as a corpse lure automatically becomes implanted. Alternatively, up to once per day, a wolf-in-sheep's-clothing can implant an egg into a helpless or pinned creature as part of a grapple action. The target can resist being implanted with a DC 19 Fortitude save, but if it fails, the seed gestates and becomes a self-aware creature that slowly steals nourishment from its host before finally exploding free of its host's gut. The parasite can be cut free of the host's belly with a DC 25 Heal check, which takes 1 hour and deals 3d6 slashing damage regardless of success or failure. Remove disease (or any similar effect) also kills an implanted egg. Wolf-in-Sheep's-Clothing Egg: Infestation-ingestion; save Fort 19; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Str damage until host reaches 0, then 3d6 damage as parasite bursts free; cure 3 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>A wolf-in-sheep's-clothing appears at first to be little more than a tree stump sitting in a clearing, perhaps with a small animal sitting atop it. Only when a predator comes close does it become clear that the small animal is in fact long dead, given false life by tendrils springing up through its form, but by then it's too late, as the wolf-in-sheep's-clothing drags the would-be hunter into its waiting maw. Though intelligent, these monsters see little need for the company of others. Their method of reproduction is as hideous as their tactic of using corpses as lures, for they implant their parasitic eggs in living hosts, giving their spawn a fresh meal to eat upon hatching. A wolf-in-sheep's-clothing is usually about 4 to 5 feet across and weighs 200 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Amnesia (Su) Once per day as a standard action, a yithian can attempt to inflict amnesia on a target it is able to communicate telepathically with. A target can resist this attack with a DC 21 Will save. If the target fails its save, it takes a permanent -4 penalty on Will saving throws and all skill checks, and loses all memories save for those the yithian chooses to leave intact. This effect can be cured by heal or greater restoration. This is a mind-affecting insanity effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. Deadly Pincers (Ex) A yithian always applies 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier to damage dealt by its pincer attacks, and deals triple damage on a critical hit. Pincers are primary attacks for yithians. Mind Swap (Su) As a full-round action, a yithian can trade minds with another living creature it is able to communicate telepathically with. This functions as magic jar, except the two minds trade bodies. An unwilling target can resist the mind swap with a DC 21 Will save, after which that particular yithian cannot attempt to swap minds with that creature again for 24 hours. The yithian can end the effect of this mind swap at any time and over any distance as a full-round action, instantly returning both minds to the proper bodies-if the yithian wishes, it may attempt to use its amnesia power on the other mind as a free action when it ends the mind swap in this way. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. Scholar (Ex) Yithians treat all knowledge skills as class skills.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Untold eons ago, the yithians inhabited a dying world. To escape their doomed planet, they cast their minds through time and space, eventually coming to rest in the strange, alien bodies they possess today. While these strange beings now reside in a distant galaxy, the yithians make use of their ability to astrally project to explore other planets, eager to find new worlds to explore. When a yithian arrives upon a new world, it often swaps minds with the creatures it encounters there so as to experience that world as if it were a native. Those who spend time in a yithian's body rarely tell of the strange times they have experienced, for yithians guard themselves well, and leave those they use in this manner amnesiacs who remember the truth only as fragmentary nightmares.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Chilling Touch (Su) A yuki-onna's touch causes 4d6 cold damage. Whenever a creature takes cold damage in this manner, it must make a DC 20 Fortitude save to avoid being staggered by the supernatural cold for 1 round. This duration stacks. The save DC is Charisma-based. Fascinating Gaze (Su) Fascinated for 1d4 rounds, 30 feet, Will DC 20 negates. The save DC is Charisma-based. Snow Dependency (Ex) A yuki-onna is staggered if she is ever in an area without snow while her snowstorm aura is suppressed or otherwise not functioning. Snowstorm (Su) A yuki-onna is surrounded by whirling blasts of snow, even in areas that wouldn't allow for such weather, that comprise a 200-foot-radius spread. Within this area, the snowfall and wind gusts cause a -4 penalty on Perception checks and ranged attacks. The wind itself blows in a clockwise rotation around the yuki-onna, and functions as severe wind (Core Rulebook 439). A yuki-onna is unaffected by snowstorms or blizzards of any kind. Any effect that causes these winds to drop below severe (such as control weather or control winds) cancels the snowstorm effect entirely.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>A yuki-onna is the restless spirit of a woman who froze to death in the snow and was never given a proper burial. She roams the wilderness, constantly searching for intelligent creatures to kill and always appearing surrounded by swirling mists of snow and ice. Eternally jaded by her unjust departure to the afterlife, a yuki-onna seeks to impose the same cruel fate upon those who still live, particularly men and those who sympathize or cooperate with them. Many foolish individuals are lured to their deaths by a yuki-onna's unparalleled beauty, which remains even as the evil spirit steadily freezes and kills her victims with her powers over frost. The transition from life to undeath corrupts a yuki-onna's soul, and even a well-intentioned, good-hearted individual who freezes in the snow may become a treacherous yuki-onna. Most yuki-onnas immediately seek out those who wronged them in life, after which they reside in an area near what was their home, haunting and killing anyone who dares to come near. Yuki-onnas hardly ever make their presences known in rural areas with larger populations, and they prefer inhabiting the countryside and wilderness. When a yuki-onna is destroyed, her body melts as though ice, leaving only a small pool of water in its stead. A yuki-onna is 5-1/2 feet tall.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Otherworldly Touch (Ex) A zoog's natural attacks can strike incorporeal creatures as if they were ghost touch weapons. Spell Sight (Su) A zoog's eyes radiate normal light in a 15-foot cone and increase the light level by one step for an additional 15 feet beyond that area. Any magic effect in this area glows faintly. This glow does not reveal the magic effect's school or strength. A zoog can quell or renew this light as a swift action.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Spiteful, nasty creatures with a taste for the flesh of sentient beings, zoogs lurk in the shadowy, moldering places of the world. Often mistaken merely for otherworldly animals, zoogs possess base intentions and vicious demeanors that set them apart from lowly beasts. Congregating in loose, tribal societies, these sinister creatures claim the depths of dark woodlands or moldy forests as their homes, favoring lands where the boundaries between worlds and planes grow thin and strange creatures-not unlike themselves-slip between reality's cracks. Although lone zoogs shy away from attacking larger creatures, when zoogs outnumber an invader they launch deadly ambushes, leaping from sagging boughs and hidden dens to swarm foes. Only strangers with quick tongues and items that appeal to zoogs' interest in magical curiosities might manage to barter for safe passage through zoog territory. While many victims of zoog attacks are consumed on the spot, some less fortunate few are dragged back to the mystical, strangely carved stones that mark the center of zoog communities. There, such captives become the doomed focus of strange ceremonies before being sacrificed to the zoogs' depraved deities. Commonly, zoogs eat fungi and plants, but they also have a taste for the meat of sentient creatures, treating the butchering and consumption of such beings as a rare privilege. Zoogs also detest cats, and go to great lengths to slay felines of any sort and devour them. Occasionally a zoog allows a spellcaster of especial depravity, or with interests in the mysteries of realms and creatures beyond the mortal world, to employ it as a familiar. A spellcaster must have the Improved Familiar feat, be chaotic neutral, and have an arcane caster level of 5th or higher to gain a zoog familiar.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Corpse Call (Su) Zuvembies cannot speak, but their strange calls and whistles captivate the minds of those who hear them. Once per day, a zuvembie may call out, and all living creatures with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher within a 100-foot spread must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or move toward the zuvembie using the most direct means possible. If this path leads them into a dangerous area such as through fire or off a cliff, the creatures receive a second saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril. Captivated creatures can take no actions other than to defend themselves. A victim within 5 feet of the zuvembie simply stands and offers no resistance to the zuvembie's attacks. This effect continues for as long as the zuvembie continues its call as a standard action each round. This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect, and has no effect on deaf creatures. The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Tied to the dark forces of nature and unholy magic, zuvembies employ fear and the wild creatures of the land to take their vengeance upon the living. Zuvembies appear to be withered, animate corpses but possess ruthless minds and blasphemous vigor. Revenge fuels a zuvembie, a hatefulness directed toward those who wronged it in life. Yet even when the last one who maligned it lies dead, its rage remains, turning against all who live, especially the relatives of the target of its original hate. Most zuvembies willingly performed the vile rituals to attain vengeance through unlife, but the transformation can also be wrought upon a helpless victim. The method of transforming into a zuvembie involves the creation and consumption of a vial of oil of animate dead, plus the performance of additional dark rites that take a day to perform and cost 3,000 gp. The ritual kills the target, who must make a DC 20 Will save. Failure results in the victim's death, while success means it reanimates as a free-willed zuvembie. Zuvembies stand between 5 and 6 feet tall and rarely weigh over 100 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Acid Spit (Ex) A chon chon can spit a disgusting blob of acid at a single foe, making a ranged attack with a range of 30 feet and no range increment. A successful attack deals 1d4 points of acid damage and forces the target to make a DC 11 Fortitude saving throw to avoid becoming nauseated for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based. Jabber (Su) A chon chon endlessly mutters half-remembered spells and meaningless arcane formulae to itself. This jabbering creates a kind of magical static that interferes with spells being cast nearby. Any creature attempting to cast a spell within 15 feet of a chon chon must make a successful DC 11 concentration check or lose the spell. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect. The concentration DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Chon chons appear to be human heads with ears so grotesquely enlarged that they can serve as fleshy wings. Their jealous hatred of all beings with full bodies easily counters their comical appearance, however. Accursed creatures drawn to places of dark magic and arcane disasters, chon chons possess the desires of the most obsessed magic users, but their dementia and twisted forms prevent them from ever obtaining the power they seek. Although these crazed beings loathe all things, they do find a vicious kind of solace among their own kind, not out of any sort of commiseration, but rather by wallowing in the pain of their own kind. Such hateful swarms gather to bear witness to each others' misery, inadvertently increasing the deadly efficacy of the entire group. A single chon chon is no larger than a human head and weighs 10 pounds at most. The creature's ears give it a total wingspan of 3 feet, making it appear much larger and more menacing. Ecology A chon chon's winglike ears endlessly flap, serving as monstrous wings that give it surprising grace in flight. These creatures always seem distracted, carrying on perpetual one-sided conversations and listening to voices only they can hear, then replying aloud with magical recitations or snippets of botched arcane formulae in a gibberish amalgam of Common, Draconic, and meaningless noises. This blathering has no meaning, mundane or arcane, but sounds so similar to the common phrases and syllables of magic that it insidiously intrudes upon the minds of spellcasters working their craft, invading their thoughts like an arcane earworm. An individual chon chon can suppress this babbling to speak semi-intelligibly-as much as such an insanely erratic creature can be called intelligible-but rarely does so for more than a minute before lapsing back into nonsense. Groups of chon chons seem to have no ability to quiet themselves, being little more than a collection of raving lunatics inspiring one another to ever-greater heights of insanity. Although chon chons appear to be disembodied human heads, they are a unique race of creatures and not merely the victims of a magical curse-though some particularly demented spellcasters have discovered methods by which they might take the forms of these creatures to horrific effect (see below). How chon chons increase their numbers few scholars know-and far fewer care to find out. Hateful of all things, including others of their kinds, to say nothing of their lack of generative organs, they seem doomed to extinction. Many assume these terrors spread their terrible condition in a way similar to that of vargouilles, which many mistake them for at first glance. Chon chons, however, lack those outsiders' terrifying kiss. Beyond general appearance, few similarities exist between these two races. Secret of the Kalkus Certain nefarious sorcerers-known in some lands as kalkus-seek to mimic the horrifying shape and strange abilities of chon chons, or aff lict their foes with such a curse. To this end, they've created a terrifying draught with the power to transform the drinker into a being resembling a chon chon, though few can guess for how long.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Acid Spit (Ex) A chon chon can spit a disgusting blob of acid at a single foe, making a ranged attack with a range of 30 feet and no range increment. A successful attack deals 2d4 points of acid damage and forces the target to make a DC 13 Fortitude saving throw to avoid becoming nauseated for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based. Jabber (Su) A chon chon swarm mutters even more loudly than a solitary chon chon. Any creature attempting to cast a spell within 30 feet of a chon chon must make a successful DC 11 concentration check or lose the spell. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect. The concentration DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Chon chons appear to be human heads with ears so grotesquely enlarged that they can serve as fleshy wings. Their jealous hatred of all beings with full bodies easily counters their comical appearance, however. Accursed creatures drawn to places of dark magic and arcane disasters, chon chons possess the desires of the most obsessed magic users, but their dementia and twisted forms prevent them from ever obtaining the power they seek. Although these crazed beings loathe all things, they do find a vicious kind of solace among their own kind, not out of any sort of commiseration, but rather by wallowing in the pain of their own kind. Such hateful swarms gather to bear witness to each others' misery, inadvertently increasing the deadly efficacy of the entire group. A single chon chon is no larger than a human head and weighs 10 pounds at most. The creature's ears give it a total wingspan of 3 feet, making it appear much larger and more menacing. Ecology A chon chon's winglike ears endlessly flap, serving as monstrous wings that give it surprising grace in flight. These creatures always seem distracted, carrying on perpetual one-sided conversations and listening to voices only they can hear, then replying aloud with magical recitations or snippets of botched arcane formulae in a gibberish amalgam of Common, Draconic, and meaningless noises. This blathering has no meaning, mundane or arcane, but sounds so similar to the common phrases and syllables of magic that it insidiously intrudes upon the minds of spellcasters working their craft, invading their thoughts like an arcane earworm. An individual chon chon can suppress this babbling to speak semi-intelligibly-as much as such an insanely erratic creature can be called intelligible-but rarely does so for more than a minute before lapsing back into nonsense. Groups of chon chons seem to have no ability to quiet themselves, being little more than a collection of raving lunatics inspiring one another to ever-greater heights of insanity. Although chon chons appear to be disembodied human heads, they are a unique race of creatures and not merely the victims of a magical curse-though some particularly demented spellcasters have discovered methods by which they might take the forms of these creatures to horrific effect (see below). How chon chons increase their numbers few scholars know-and far fewer care to find out. Hateful of all things, including others of their kinds, to say nothing of their lack of generative organs, they seem doomed to extinction. Many assume these terrors spread their terrible condition in a way similar to that of vargouilles, which many mistake them for at first glance. Chon chons, however, lack those outsiders' terrifying kiss. Beyond general appearance, few similarities exist between these two races. Secret of the Kalkus Certain nefarious sorcerers-known in some lands as kalkus-seek to mimic the horrifying shape and strange abilities of chon chons, or aff lict their foes with such a curse. To this end, they've created a terrifying draught with the power to transform the drinker into a being resembling a chon chon, though few can guess for how long.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Steal Fire (Su) As a standard action, a kijimuna can call out to a nonmagical fire within 30 feet equivalent in size to the flames of a burning torch. Doing so causes the flame to become a light similar to that created by a dancing lights spell, under the control of the kijimuna. An attended object can make a DC 13 Reflex saving throw to avoid this effect. Unlike a dancing lights spell, a kijimuna's steal fire ability can cause a stolen fire to strike a creature, either ringing the target in light as per the spell faerie fire for 5 minutes, or dealing 2d6 points of fire damage (DC 13 Reflex, half ). Both save DCs are Charisma-based. A lantern, candle, torch, or similar item that has its flame stolen cannot be relit by any means for 24 hours.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The childlike kijimunas bear physical similarities to their Inner Sea cousins, the goblins, sharing their small size, leathery skin, and large, pointed ears. However, kijimunas' hair stands out as their most prominent features-long, wild manes of blazing red. These tricky creatures nearly always wear devilish grins, causing some who first see them to mistake them for trouble-making urchins. Kijimunas take pleasure in two pastimes: fishing and playing pranks. When a kijimuna grows distracted from its catch, it seeks out targets for its practical jokes. These hijinks often prove relatively harmless, but some escalate to the point of becoming injurious or potentially lethal. Most kijimunas genuinely do not understand how their "play" frustrates, harms, or otherwise impacts the targets of their tricks and are insulted when victims become angry rather than seeing the comedy of the situation. The insulted kijimunas then take retribution the only way they know how: with more elaborate pranks. A kijimuna stands only about 3 feet tall and weighs approximately 50 pounds. Its size belies its sinewy strength, gained from years of fishing and climbing tall banyan trees. Ecology Consummate fishermen, kijimunas while away the hours fishing on the shores of oceans or large lakes. Although they delight in the taste of fish-especially the eyes- they easily grow bored and become distracted, sometimes leaving their fishing spears and a pile of fish to rot onshore. The creatures alleviate their boredom by playing tricks on fishermen and villagers living near their cavern or treetop homes. A kijimuna makes every effort to hide its involvement in the tricks it pulls, more out of a sense of pride about a well-executed joke than fear of reprisal. A young kijimuna grows to adulthood in a matter of 5 months, but retains its childish appearance for the entirety of its life. In the unlikely event that its activities don't cause its premature demise, the creature lives for about 15 years. An elderly kijimuna, having reached the ripe old age of 12, settles down and does little else beyond fish in solitude, except perhaps to bargain with children from nearby villages for its catch. It extracts a promise from a child in return for the fish, as well instructions for a devious prank or practical joke to pull on an elder. Although their societies and world view differ wildly from those of the goblins of the Inner Sea Region and elsewhere in Golarion, physiologically kijimuna are little different. As true goblinoids, any sort of device, concoction, or magical effect that only affects goblins affects these erratic tricksters as well. Habitat &amp; Society Tribes of kijimunas maintain small lairs in seaside caves, amid groves of banyan trees, or in other secluded, enclosed areas near the shore. Their homes typically stink of rotten fish from catches brought home and promptly forgotten, while the walls often bear half-completed diagrams of pranks members intend to pull on neighboring creatures. Kijimunas rarely pull pranks on each other, mostly because they hold their peoples' cleverness in high regard, and believe that it's impossible to trick their own kind. Occasionally, however, some event leaves a kijimuna the victim of some accidental hilarity- well-placed meal scraps left on its face, tripping into a tide pool, falling down-such occurrences are the height of kijimuna comedy. Much like their Inner Sea cousins, kijimunas have a strong, bizarre hatred for a particular creature-in this case, the octopus. When faced with octopuses, kijimunas either flee in terror or desperately attack, their whoops and howls vastly exaggerating the threat the cephalopods pose. Kijimunas often share frightening stories about octopuses at night, scaring one another with fearful tales of squirming tentacles and clutching suckers. Occasionally these stories incite groups to action, leading them to go on raids of local tide pools and rocky beaches where the sea creatures regularly lurk. The resulting battles prove loud but brief, with skewered octopuses and the occasional "hostage" taken as supplies for the goblinoids' most startling jokes. Kijimunas have few strong feelings about other animals, especially as predators more dangerous than large lizards and the occasional hunting cat rarely occupy the same lands that they do. They delight in sharing their homes with large tropical birds, however, a sentiment that is hardly reciprocated, as they frequently employ the creatures (and the creatures' eggs) in their pranks and take endless delight in mimicking the birds' squawking. Spiders, with their numerous legs, are generally avoided by kijimuna, many of which suspect the insects might be just miniature octopuses in disguise. Kijimunas share goblins' affinity for fire, but this attraction manifests in a less overtly destructive way. These creatures have developed secret techniques allowing them to befriend small fires, calling such flames to them to light their paths, lead travelers into their pranks, or steal a lantern's ability to hold a light. No kijimunas remember how their people managed to make friends with small fires, just that they did a long time ago. Large fires remain dangerous to kijimunas, however, and not only do they have no power over such blazes, but they generally have nothing pleasant to say about any flame larger than a campfire. Kijimunas often form relationships with other humanoids who fish along the same shore. Some befriend such creatures, eagerly sharing all manner of trivial secrets-where the best fishing spots are, what trees grow the stinkiest fruit, and which rocks octopuses hardly ever visit. As a show of friendship, kijimunas make their companions favored targets for particularly embarrassing practical jokes. Those of a superstitious bent view kijimunas as evil spirits, pointing to the ghostly flames that often follow the creatures and their mischievous behavior as proof. Once in a while, someone discovers kijimunas' hatred for octopuses and carries one around as a ward. This typically backfires spectacularly, as the kijimunas then focus their ire on the person-who is obviously some sort of octopus spy or ally. Kijimunas reserve their most elaborate tricks for cephalopod sympathizers. The only counter to most humanoids' distrust and wariness regarding kijimunas manifests in times of famine or poor fishing seasons. In numerous such cases, a town on the brink of starvation has found its food stores replenished on a daily basis by an energized tribe of kijimunas, as these creatures apply their considerable fishing talents to feed their neighbors. After all, kijimunas realize that corpses are considerably less entertaining than living creatures, especially when serving as the butts of jokes. Thus, most communities accept that if their benefactors happen to play a trick or two on them, matters could be far worse.</Description>

    <Description>The Old Man is the herald of Irori, a teacher, mentor, guide, and trainer in the service of the god of knowledge. He can be patient or irate, confusing or enlightening, lenient or strict, depending on what his students need. He often wanders Golarion as a mortal man, bereft of his supernatural powers, instructing others and leading by example. If attacked when in this limited shape, he usually allows himself to be beaten or killed, especially if his "death" would provide a powerful lesson to an important student. If slain as a mortal, he simply reincarnates in his celestial form, unharmed, and never bears a grudge about it. The Old Man's true form is that of an elderly human man, perhaps of Tien or Vudrani ancestry but never clearly identifiable as such. He is typically bald and wiry, and usually wears a long white moustache or beard. Though he appears frail and may support himself with a cane, crutch, or staff, he is incredibly strong and can move with an alien grace when he so chooses. He may dress in a simple robe, an elaborate ceremonial garment, or a simple loincloth. He is often accompanied by one of five animals: a turtle, monkey, ox, rooster, or pig. When not acting on Irori's behalf, he likes tending to animals, planting gardens, meditating, practicing martial arts forms, swimming, and quipping with pretty young students. Ecology The Old Man enjoys exceedingly spicy food, good wine, hearty bread, plain rice, seasoned noodles, and many other kinds of Tien and Vudrani food. He of course does not need to eat, but he enjoys the taste and the act of sharing a friendly meal with mortals. He is normally an example of moderation, but once each year he indulges himself in an episode of gluttony and excess, telling raucous jokes, challenging others to wrestling matches, and pinching bottoms. His antics are meant in good fun, and the targets are usually folks too full of their own superiority to recognize their shortcomings- folks who could stand a good roast, throwdown, or goosing. The Old Man exists mainly to teach, but takes violent action when necessary to protect something of value to his god or destroy a threat to Irori's church. Because he can deal with threats in a nonlethal manner, he may try to subdue and humble an opponent who is merely arrogant or misguided rather than malevolent, but when necessary he has been known to crush the skulls of giants with his bare hands and break the spine of a raging dragon. When in battle, he takes great care to avoid damaging mortal structures, especially places of study, worship, or meditation, preferring to lure his opponents elsewhere-often by pretending to be a coward. Habitat &amp; Society The Old Man loves to see people achieving their potential, even if a person's lifetime limits that potential. He enjoys watching over favored students in successive lifetimes, guiding them in different ways each time. His soul is that of a teacher, and sometimes he claims to be one of Irori's first followers when the god was just a great mortal. If a person genuinely asks him for help with something (as opposed to an enemy asking as part of a ruse), he can't help but offer some assistance or guidance, even if he can only contribute a strong back and steady hands-but only if the person asking would otherwise be willing to do the work without help. He often says, "It is not enough to pray for a thing; you must work for it-the work is the prayer." The faithful claim that he has helped build hundreds of temples in Vudra, whether by moving heavy stones or simply carrying meals to hungry workers, never revealing his true identity or asking for payment, but accepting simple things if offered, such as a loaf of bread, a cup of wine, or a bowl of rice. When called to Golarion with mortal magic, the Old Man is not so generous with his efforts, for he feels that anyone powerful enough to call him can afford to pay for his services. He is not interested in gold and jewels, but accepts magic items that can aid young monks in their training and travels; rare books of history that contain valuable anecdotes; magic that increases Intelligence or Wisdom; and pledges to build or restore temples, shrines, schools, and monasteries of Irori in places that could benefit from such attention. While he often proves curt when summoned, he quickly assesses the honest needs of whoever called him and proves quick to act if their wishes parallel the will of Irori. In battle, the Old Man is fierce and direct in his attacks and elusive and flexible in his defense. He often uses his abilities to make himself nearly impossible to hit, striking carefully at his opponent to weaken or disable it so he can finish it off quickly. He prefers fighting with his hands or simple weapons such as a club or a staff, and against flying foes he throws individual pebbles the size of sling bullets, usually picking up a handful at a time but sometimes pulling them out of thin air. After a battle, followers of Irori look for any pebbles touched by the Old Man, noting the impressions of his fingerprints in the stones and the subtle aura of Irori's blessing. The followers use the pebbles thereafter as reliquaries in a temple or shrine, or incorporate them into magic items or simple jewelry. Sometimes, if the Old Man thinks a dangerous foe can be humbled by a crippling injury and might alter its character because of this, he tries to put out one of an enemy's eyes to teach it a lesson, and only destroys its other eye if the creature continues to fight (see page 193 of Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat for details on called shots). He uses his maneuverability on land, air, and water to his best advantage, especially if he can slow an opponent in difficult terrain. He considers no creature to be his enemy, but willingly battles those who choose to be his opponent. The Five Animals Sometimes the Old Man appears or travels with one of five animals. They do not have unique names, and he addresses them merely as Turtle, Monkey, Ox, Rooster, and Pig. They obey him as any well-trained animal might obey its owner, though they can be temperamental and sometimes refuse to follow commands. They do not appear to be more intelligent than common animals or have any unusual powers (nothing that couldn't be taught with conventional training using the Handle Animal skill), though they immediately vanish if attacked. The animals may actually be detailed, lifelike projections of animals from the Old Man's mind or perhaps something like a summoner's eidolon, used to present himself as a common man or provide lessons on patience and kindness, but he treats them as if they were individual living creatures he has known for a long time. There may be a secret significance to which animal he brings with him for a particular task (other than the obvious, such as using Ox to pull a plough, which of course Rooster cannot do), but his followers have been unable to spot a pattern in these choices.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Spiky Skin (Ex) An earth yai may grow spikes from its stony skin at will as a free action. These spikes are treated as armor spikes that deal 1d10 points of damage. Stony Missile (Su) As a swift action, an earth yai can fire an incredibly dense stone from its third eye. This attack has a range of 200 feet, with no range increment, and deals 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage. Upon striking the target, the stone immediately makes an Awesome Blow attempt against the target using the earth yai's CMB.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Although they possess the rocky physiques and near indestructibility of stone giants, earth yai scorn that race's humble ambitions, and instead prove as brutal and destructive as avalanches. For them, physical force and destruction are the ultimate demonstration of power. This belief doesn't necessarily require them to be the strongest or to go on gory rampages, though. After all, what is mere strength if a soldier can fire a catapult that brings down an entire tower, or an emperor can give the decree beginning a war that ravages an entire empire, using both their tools and words to sow ruin. Such ability to cause calamity grants one power over others; those who have the potential to cause the greatest devastation have the greatest power. Earth yai endlessly seek to hold the greatest power, leading many to become brutal warlords or bandit kings, but some to embrace more subtle, long-term machinations in their pursuit of gradual and far-reaching ruin. In its natural form, an earth yai stands 16 feet tall and weighs 3,000 pounds. Ecology Earth yai possess forms similar to the rocky bodies of the stone giants their otherworldly shapes mimic. While stone giants often appear to be sculpted from rock, earth yai tend to have a more rugged appearance, with features that seem to have been clawed from mountainsides, teeth and claws like sharp stones, and three eyes like angry red gems. Their skin is always as hard as rock, the cracks and ravines that riddle their bodies having no impact on their formidable resilience. Like their yai brethren, earth yai possess an unnerving third eye that serves as a portal through which destruction passes. Whenever one so chooses, it can cause a shard of stone to blast from its eye at the speed of a catapult shot. Those struck risk being crushed by the rock, but might also be thrown aside by the sizable projectile. Earth yai typically use this incredible ability not only to annihilate those who oppose them and intimidate witnesses, but also to tear down larger structures or sow greater devastations, like by using it to start landslides, break dams, or destroy bridge supports. Habitat &amp; Society Earth yai dream of conquest like many other oni, but how they pursue victory tends to vary from individual to individual. While all would agree that victory is only attained when one's foes are crushed and shattered, the methods used to accomplish this goal range from brute displays of power to the slow erosion of a foe till nothing remains. The scope of an earth yai's ambitions also seems largely dependent on its age, with younger oni proving content to raid territories and subjugate peasant villages, while older individuals seek greater conquests and the destruction of whole lands. Earth yai enjoy the moment when their long-term plans reach fruition, and might spend decades reveling in past successes before moving on to new conquests. An earth yai who manages to conquer a community or subjugate a region might spend this time acting as a brutal tyrant, installing itself in a palace or fortress and demanding that its slaves supply its every whim. Those who refuse are dramatically murdered. While one of these oni would never give up past conquests, most earth yai eventually grow bored and seek new challenges-if such opportunities don't present themselves during the oni's rule. These oni might move on to find new opponents, but still regularly return to their past holdings to reinforce their control and instill dread among their prisoners. While an earth yai does not have the greatest intelligence and cannot necessarily outwit a wise hero, most possess deep wells of patience and centuries of experience. An oni who finds itself bested time and time again might wait out foes or opposing alliances. Their ages of experience mean that earth yai can generally discern the amount of time they must wait before a threat to them passes- perhaps with the help of a few inconvenient disasters to accelerate an enemy's decline. When two or more earth yai encounter one another, they invariably engage in an extended strategic match, seeking to undermine and outdo each other in acts of cleverness and violence. All earth yai know that a battle between two of their kind must end in a face-to-face confrontation and brutal combat. Occasions for assassination or impersonal defeats might arise in such conf licts, but they are never exploited. These oni see a final battle between members of their kind as a form of honor, and all seek to avoid slighting even their weakest or most reviled kindred. Although all earth yai dream of being the masters of regal citadels dominating lands filled with fearful servants, few actually achieve this goal. Those still campaigning for their despotic dreams typically find lairs in mazelike mountain ravines and in large caverns near the earth's surface. These hideaways can prove notoriously difficult to uncover, as the oni often make use of their passwall ability to sink through solid barriers or walk past gates that don't appear to be portals at all. There they meditate and plot, seeing all the threads of probable events in their minds and determining which ones they need to pull on to shape the future to their liking. If any creature interrupts an oni in its lair, the oni violently attacks, viewing intruders as not just dangerous, but dishonorable, as they trespass upon the oni's private home. This obsession with privacy extends not just to yai in their secret lairs, but also to those with greater holdings. Most earth yai only tolerate creatures of living stone to share their homes, and only bear the intrusion of lesser creatures when they themselves demand the lesser creatures' presence. Earth Yai Daifu Just as stone giants develop a variety of special abilities related to their age, so too do earth yai grow in power as their years mount upon them. Known as daifus, such earth yai have Charisma scores of at least 20 and can use the following spell-like abilities once per day: stoneskin, summon monster XI (earth elementals only), wall of stone. Most earth yai daifus are sorcerers or oracles with abilities tied to the earth or destruction. Earth yai daifus add +1 to their CRs.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Change Shape (Su) On the Material Plane, a raiju typically assumes the form of a badger, cat, giant rat, monkey, weasel, or wolf (as per beast shape II) to blend in with native wildlife. Even in these forms, however, it typically has pale coloration and lightninglike patterns. Electric Body (Su) As an immediate action, a raiju can transform itself into a ball of living lightning. While in this form, the raiju gains the incorporeal subtype and incorporeal quality. It only takes half damage from corporeal sources if they are magical (it takes no damage from nonmagical weapons and objects). Additionally, it sparks with electricity while it is in this form. Any creature that touches the raiju with a natural or unarmed attack or whose square the raiju passes through during its movement must succeed at a DC 17 Reflex save or take 2d6 points of electricity damage. The save DC is Dexterity-based. In normal weather, a raiju can remain incorporeal for a number of rounds per day equal to its Hit Dice, though it can remain incorporeal for as long as it pleases during a thunderstorm. Shocking Burst (Su) Besides dealing normal slashing damage, the claw and tail of a raiju are considered to have the shocking burst weapon special quality. They deal 1d6 extra points of electrical damage on a normal hit and an additional 1d10 points on a critical hit.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Raijus are beings of living electricity that cross the border between the mundane world and their native plane, a region of the Plane of Air alive with endless thunderstorms. Raijus can be involuntarily hurled across the dimensions by a powerful lightning bolt originating in the Plane of Air, or might be called by magic users to do their bidding. When the weather is calm, raijus are quiet, and assume the forms of Tiny or Small animals such as cats, raccoon dogs, monkeys, or weasels. As weather gets worse, however, so do their tempers. In their real form, raijus appear as lean, foxlike creatures with long, sharp claws and luminous eyes, shrouded by crackling electricity. These swift, even panicky, creatures are charged with the electricity of their native realm, and those who touch them risk receiving a deadly shock. In times of great distress, they transform entirely into living electricity, a force that few barriers can contain and even fewer creatures can survive the passage of. In their natural forms, raijus measure about 3-1/2 feet long and weigh 40 pounds, but they often take the form of small mammals when not on the Plane of Air. They can be still recognized as raijus in this form, however, as they bear markings suggestive of jagged lightning. Ecology When they are born on the Elemental Plane of Air, raijus are semi-sentient, formless spheres of living electricity. Only after a period of weeks or months do they gradually take on a favored form, that of a vaguely rodent- or caninelike beast, agile enough to twist and bound amid the endless storms and debris that soar through their home plane. Sometimes particularly powerful elemental storms, strange eddies of magic, or drifting portals bring raijus to the Material Plane. When this happens, invariably during a thunderstorm, the creature spends but a little time regaining its bearings; it then uses its innate shapechange power to blend in with the local fauna, taking on the shape of a local animal-typically a cat, raccoon dog, monkey, or weasel. While such raijus constantly seek to return to their home plane, they aren't terribly uncomfortable on the Material Plane. When the weather is calm, raijus are likewise quiet, and remain in their apparently harmless animal forms all the time. As weather gets worse, however, they become increasingly energetic, racing and soaring about in rampages that occasionally prove accidentally destructive. They typically resume their natural forms during such storms, reveling in their memories of their home plane. Some scholars believe that raijus can return to their native plane when lightning strikes them, thus explaining the creatures' eagerness and agitation during such weather. Habitat &amp; Society Raijus are extraplanar creatures that have little organization on their home plane, roaming and romping as little more than wild animals in their dangerous planar wilderness. On the Material Plane, they gravitate toward areas where storms are frequent, or where the effects of lightning are apparent. This means they frequently occupy the windward sides of mountains and wet forests, eagerly making small dens in the trunks of lightning-blasted trees or scorched, rocky crevices. Raijus can live on the Material Plane indefinitely, though all seek ways they might return to the Elemental Plane of Air. Those separated from their native plane rarely manage to find their way home without the intervention of some other being. Although life on the Material Plane often means a raiju will never encounter others of its kind again, few seem to realize this fact, or, if they do, become despondent over it. Rather, many raijus adopt the habits and communities of the creatures they spend the most time imitating and live as such creatures-except, of course, during violent lightning storms. Many believe that despite their destructive natures, raijus are good luck. This belief comes from the creatures' propensity for finding warm spots to nestle into and rest in during the lazy times between storms. One story tells of a raiju that found a snug spot in the navel of a sleeping giant. The giant was exhausted after a day of tromping on a local town and stealing away an entire year's harvest of rice, so it didn't even notice the sleeping creature. When the giant finally awoke and felt the dozing creature's claws on its belly, it flew into a panicked rage. The sudden activity startled the sleeping raiju, and it immediately summoned a storm and called down lightning, which promptly electrocuted the giant-killing the villain on the spot. When the curious townsfolk saw the brief, explosive storm nearby, they stopped rebuilding their homes and came to investigate. What they found was a charred giant and a sleepy raiju, nestled amid their stolen rice. Raijus have been considered lucky spirits ever since, though many refuse to sleep face up during lighting storms lest their bellies seem like a comfortable place for a raiju to rest. Kaenju This rarer variant of the raiju dwells upon the Plane of Fire, in regions filled with smoke and wracked by firestorms and endless volcanic eruptions. Just as their kin from the Plane of Air, kaenjus may visit mundane worlds during volcanic eruptions or when huge fires devastate towns or forests. A kaenju is very similar to its cousin, but its substance is made of fire instead of lightning. Defensive Abilities: Kaenjus have the fire subtype (immunity to fire, vulnerability to cold) and resistance 10 to lightning. Special Attacks: A kaenju's tail and claws are considered flaming burst weapons. Special Qualities: All kaenjus' supernatural abilities are based on flame instead of lightning, and have the same effects but deal fire damage instead of electricity damage. Also, instead of a raiju's spell-like abilities, a kaenju can cast produce flame at will, and flaming sphere and quench 3 times per day.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Festering Heads (Su) Once the heads in a shenzuzhou's collection rot out naturally, it can hurl them as a thrown splash weapon (range increment 30 ft.) as a standard action. A thrown head ruptures on impact, releasing noxious gas that produces an effect identical to a stinking cloud spell (DC 22). The save is Charisma-based. A typical shenzuzhou carries 1d4 festering heads. The heads do not rupture if thrown by another creature.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Malevolent spirits looking to bolster their armies often look no farther than the burial grounds of giant tribes, where hardy corpses are typically left unguarded and forgotten. After a giant is animated, it is beheaded in a gruesome ritual, the stump of its neck is cauterized into a blackened lump of scar tissue, and a twisted face manifests across its torso. What was once a fearsome giant is now a shenzushou. It loses the ability to speak and eat and can do nothing but obey the commands of whoever possesses its head-often the necromancer or oni that created it. Thrall shenzushous are nowhere near as terrible as those shenzushous whose heads have been destroyed or transported to another plane. These latter creatures run aimlessly through the land, ever searching for new heads and the control they believe attaining them will bring over the monsters' damned existences. Seeking to steal their victims' heads for themselves, shezuzhous decapitate their kills, keeping grisly collections of heads from the victims they have slain. Even without their heads, shenzuzhous stand over 8 feet tall. Cords of thick muscle twist beneath the creatures' hairless gray corpse-flesh. Their skin is cold to the touch and their wounds do not bleed. A shenzuzhou carries little else except for its weapons and the heads of its victims, strung together by their hair and hung from its belt.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Breath Weapon (Su) A gashadokuro can expel a blast of jagged bone shards from its maw as a standard action. In addition to tearing through any creatures within range, the shards from this attack cover the ground in a thick layer of bone and detritus, causing the affected area to become difficult terrain. Corpse Consumption (Su) If a gashadokuro kills a creature by using its swallow whole special ability, the gashadokuro automatically consumes its victim's body, gaining a number of hit points equal to the victim's Constitution score. This ability cannot heal a gashadokuro beyond its maximum number of hit points. Consumed creatures cannot be resurrected by any effect short of a miracle or wish spell until the gashadokuro that devoured them is destroyed. Starvation Aura (Su) A gashadokuro emits a powerful aura that causes all creatures within range to feel the intense pains of starvation. Every creature within 60 feet must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude save or become fatigued and succumb to the supernatural starvation of the gashadokuro, taking 2d6 points of nonlethal damage at the end of its turn each round if it remains in the area at this time. Even after leaving the area or slaying the gashadokuro, an affected creature continues to starve and cannot heal from the nonlethal damage dealt by this ability until it gets food (see page 444 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook for rules on starvation).</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Gashadokuros are enormous skeletons that come into being as a result of mass starvation, the countless victims of such a tragedy fusing together into an undead colossus that continues to hunger even in death. Although a gashadokuro may at first appear to be the skeleton of some giant humanoid, the detritus sifting through its joints and its deadly ability to absorb creatures quickly reveal that the animated horror is something far more terrible. A gashadokuro's size depends on the scale of the famine that caused its emergence, with more devastating food shortages resulting in larger gashadokuros. A typical gashadokuro is 30 feet tall and weighs up to 5,000 pounds. Ecology Gashadokuros usually form in the wake of horrible natural disasters such as floods, droughts, or destructive storms that destroy crops and leave thousands without food. As hunger turns into famine and famine turns into death, the spirits of the dying sometimes leave a fragment of their pain and hunger embedded in their physical bodies. When the haunted corpses begin to decompose and sink into the ground, the bones do not fertilize the nearby grubs and plants as would normal bone meal, but instead become the devourers, absorbing countless vermin and showing the first sparks of undead energy as the bone shards and bits of marrow begin to move through the dirt of their own accord. The cursed bones of the starved victims congregate beneath the soil, and when they finally stitch themselves together and take the form of a gashadokuro, the undead monstrosity bursts forth and begins an endless search to satisfy its unearthly hunger. Although its body is composed mostly of bones and other organic material that never fully decomposed, a gashadokuro is far from mindless, and still possesses a flicker of intelligence. The combined intellects of so many once-living creatures weave together into a rudimentary but dark cunning, and the undead colossus uses its feral instincts to hunt living creatures, forever seeking to sate its ineradicable, collective memory of starvation. A gashadokuro's tombstone-sized teeth and jagged claws are more than capable of destroying most foes, but it wields simple tools-such as an unearthed tree trunk used as a club-when it needs some sort of weapon to crush its opponents. In a grisly mockery of human digestion, a gashadokuro may capture a dead victim in its jaws and incorporate the corpse into the innumerable bodies that churn within its massive chest cavity. In a matter of seconds, the corpse begins to turn into bleached, brittle bones, its indigestible possessions falling through the gaps in its skeletal frame as the giant lumbers on. Only when the gashadokuro's rib cage is completely filled with the bones of victims does its terrible hunger subside. But as the creature wanders and small vestiges of its meals tumble slowly from within, a gashadokuro starts to know hunger once again, and it resumes its hunt for new prey. A gashadokuro will hunt and kill anything, its appetite knowing no bounds. Nonetheless, it prefers larger creatures in the hope that such food will end its perpetual craving. Tales tell of ranchers who unknowingly raise their livestock in a gashadokuro-plagued area, awaking to find all of their cattle gone, a trail of prematurely bleached bones leading into the distance their only clue as to their animals' whereabouts. Although the bones cradled within a gashadokoru's torso serve to abate the creature's hunger, the behemoth also uses them as deadly weapons against more formidable prey. In combat, a gashadokuro sprays a wicked blast of fragmented bone shards at its foes, the deadly shrapnel flaying skin from enemies, stripping bark from trees, and punching through plate mail. After it has slaughtered its opponents, the gashadokuro picks up the bloody bodies and consumes them in its gruesome fashion, converting its victims' bones into additional fuel for its deadly attacks. Habitat &amp; Society Gashadokuros can arise from almost any terrain, although they are most common in harsh, resource-strapped lands like scorching deserts or icy tundra. However, even urban areas can give rise to one of these predatory horrors if its people succumb to the right mix of hunger and despair. Once formed, a gashadokuro's ability to range knows no bounds, and such terrors often travel hundreds of miles beyond their place of emergence to feed. Despite its ability to understand the common tongue of the starved individuals who make up its bulk, a gashadokuro cannot be bargained with and does not make allies, even among its own kind. Its voracity drives it ever onward, and it knows no distinction between good and evil victims, wreaking havoc wherever it goes with no regard for the target of its endless craving. A gashadokuro's single-minded destructiveness can often unite even the bitterest and most ancient of rivals in tenuous pacts to rid the land of its monstrous presence. Occasionally, evil clerics and powerful necromancers can bend a gashadokuro to their will and, if successful, unleash the monster as a scourge against their enemies. Few risk such an attempt, however, as most evil spellcasters know that should they lose control over such a powerful minion, the consequences would be dire. The intentional creation of a gashadokuro is almost unheard of, as the drawn-out suffering and deprivation required to create such mass starvation require time and a concerted effort few can muster. However, there have been instances of particularly heinous rulers who have sought the power of such an undead goliath, starving their people to death in order to use the ensuing monster as a weapon in war or for some other detestable purpose. More often, though, cruel warlords and merciless generals who wish to create such a horrific beast take the opposite route and attempt to cut off their enemies' access to food, effectively striking the targeted nations twice when the famished citizens starve, then rise from the earth as gashadokuros eager to destroy those whom they may have once called allies and kin.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Enticing Head-Fruits (Su) A jinmenju's head-fruits produce powerful toxins that cause hallucinations and compel nearby creatures to eat the rotten melons. As a swift action, a jinmenju can alter the appearance of any of its head-fruits to take on the particular face of any creature the tree has seen or has memory of. If it cannot determine what kind of face or form would be most appealing to a particular target by using its share memory spell-like ability, a jinmenju makes its head-fruit take the appearance of a delicious-looking melon. A jinmenju can alter its head-fruits into any combination of up to a maximum of six faces or shapes at one time. Any creature that begins its turn within 5 feet of a head-fruit must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or be magically compelled to immediately grab the head-fruit and eat it as soon as possible. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that jinmenju's enticing head-fruits for 24 hours. A head-fruit removed from a jinmenju's branch retains some of the tree's magic and maintains its shape for 1d3 hours before reverting to its natural form. The save DC is Constitution-based. In addition to tasting terrible, a jinmenju's head-fruits are incredibly poisonous, and anyone who takes a bite out of one suffers from the following effect. Head-Fruit Poison: Head-fruit-ingested; save Fort DC 22; frequency 1/round for 6 round; effect 1d3 Wisdom damage and confused for 1 round; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based. Intoxicating Stench (Su) Once per day as a swift action, a jinmenju can cause its fruit to immediately begin to ferment, emitting an unnaturally sweet aroma in a 60- foot spread that draws creatures toward the tree. Once activated, the aroma persists for 6 rounds unless dispersed by moderate or stronger wind. All creatures within the area must succeed at a DC 22 Will save each round or become captivated. Once a creature becomes captivated, it takes no actions save to approach the jinmenju via the most direct route possible. If this path leads it into a dangerous area, such as through fire or off a cliff, that creature receives a second saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril. A victim that is attacked by the jinmenju gets a new saving throw as a free action during each of the jinmenju's attacks to overcome the effect. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Constitution-based. Unsettling Drone (Su) A jinmenju's numerous head-fruits emit a low, persistent hum that unnerves any living creature who hears it. Any creature within 30 feet of a jinmenju must succeed at a DC 18 Will save or become shaken until it leaves the affected area and for 1d4 rounds thereafter. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that jinmenju's unsettling drone for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>One of the more disquieting plants native to Tian Xia, the jinmenju is an eerie tree that grows in hilly regions far from civilization. While a jinmenju otherwise appears to be nothing more than a twisted, gnarled cherry tree, the fruit that hangs from its branches makes it impossible to mistake for any other flora, for each fleshy melon possesses the semblance of a human head. In their natural form, a jinmenju's head-fruits-which sag from the branches and look entirely too heavy for the short, stringy vines they hang from-resemble dark brown melons with vaguely humanoid facial features. A jinmenju can alter these head-fruits to resemble virtually any form, making the rotting melons attractive or at least intriguing to potential prey. Using its ability to delve into nearby creatures' memories, a jinmenju simulates the appearance of whichever creature (or fruit) will draw prey within range of its branches, which it uses to pummel enraptured creatures to unconsciousness before devouring them. A jinmenju's head-fruit retains a magical connection to the tree that bore it, so even after it is lopped from its branch, a transformed melon still bears the likeness chosen by the jinmenju, though the tree's compulsion effects remain distinctly tied to the tree itself. Ecology A jinmenju's head-fruits are covered in a thick skin that is easy to bite into, with an outmost layer similar in texture to that of a lumpy peach. Whenever potential prey nears a jinmenju, it wills its fruit to prematurely begin the rotting process. In addition to enticing its prey with hallucinations, a jinmenju can instantly ferment its head-fruits, emitting a sweet, intoxicating odor that lures creatures to the tree and captivates them. Those who have tasted a head-fruit and lived to tell of the experience claim that the fruit's flesh has a mushy consistency that makes it hard to hold in one's hands, and as it slips from one's grip, the world seems to melt away as well. Jinmenjus are remarkably intelligent and versatile plants, and can augment their illusions by creating sounds to further convince creatures that the false images they are seeing are real as they near the trees' head-fruits. By making minute alterations to the structure of its dense but flexible bark, a jinmenju can produce a series of cracks, shudders, and pops that can be combined to imitate almost any sound, including a creature's voice or bursts of noise capable of damaging and deafening the tree's enemies. While a jinmenju can communicate in the common language of those it most often encounters, it rarely does so unless it has been given a suitable gift or is forced to speak by some other means. Habitat &amp; Society Jinmenjus are found primarily in hilly and mountainous regions, far from any civilization whose residents might seek to put an end to such a deceptive and ravenous creature. Eternally patient, jinmenjus usually reside in the same spot for hundreds of years, only changing locales if their current location runs out of food for an extended period of time. While most jinmenjus are simply hungry predators that have no interest in interacting with other intelligent creatures, some will communicate with others if given payment in the form of food, though many jinmenjus also desire particular magical or mundane objects they have learned of while scanning their targets' memories throughout the years. Once it has been befriended, a jinmenju may provide creatures with some of its vast wealth of acquired memories, though such a relationship is tenuous in the extreme, and only the most hardy creatures can withstand a jinmenju's magic long enough to provide the tree with an offering and ask for its knowledge. Brave or foolhardy adventurers seeking knowledge of their ancestors or perhaps lost loved ones may seek a jinmenju, hoping its expansive collection of memories might contain clues or information about the person they seek. Even if such folk do manage to convince the fickle tree to share some enlightening memory, they are often heartbroken when the jinmenju callously informs the memory-seekers afterward that it killed and devoured their sought-after friend, and so those who dare seek a jinmenju's knowledge should be careful of what questions they ask.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Roaring Gale (Su) As a standard action three times per day, a wind yai can select a point within sight on which to conjure a violent updraft, violently flinging its opponents into the air. When it uses this ability, the wind yai must make a single bull rush combat maneuver check (CMB equal to the wind yai's caster level + its Cha bonus; +21 for most wind yai) against all creatures in a 10-foot-radius burst. Any creature with a CMD score lower than the result of this check is hurled 1d6 x 10 feet straight up, and lands prone in a spot 1d4 x 5 feet from its original position. The wind yai selects the direction it wishes to throw its victims, and may select a different direction for each victim, though each must be thrown in a straight line. Creatures take falling damage for any impacts while traveling up or down in this way; if a creature collides with an object during its sideways movement, both the creature and the object take 1d6 points of damage and the creature is knocked prone in the space adjacent to the obstacle. Shocking Missile (Su) As a swift action, a wind yai can fire a bolt of electricity from its third eye as a ranged touch attack. This attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment, and deals 4d6 points of damage. If the creature struck is wearing metal armor or is made of metal, it instead takes 4d8 points of damage. Upon being struck by this attack, the victim must make a DC 25 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Wind yai may take after the graceful cloud giants in general appearance, but given their hard, icy stares and the brooding manner in which they carry themselves, observers may not immediately relate the two races. Whereas cloud giants wear their finely made robes and ornate jewelry with an air of regality and serenity, their oni imitators manage to make even the humblest garments and adornments seem ostentatious, and are always shrouded in an air of darkness that many liken to an ill omen. Though wind yai look as though they have one foot in the light of day and the other in the darkness of night, the shadow that perpetually swirls about the otherworldly beings is not the result of any natural source; in actuality, the supernatural night that constantly follows wind yai is a raw magical manifestation of their foul intentions and evil nature. Wind yai do not shape the winds-they force their will upon them, commanding the powers of the sky to commit acts of domineering brutality with none of the natural grace normally associated with the element. Whereas a cloud giant is always accompanied by a gentle breeze, the malicious wind yai brings with it only furious storms, the chaotic winds tossing its hair about and blowing dust into its unblinking triad of eyes. A wind yai is 20 feet tall and weighs over 5,000 pounds. Ecology A wind yai does not appear to walk upon the ground so much as glide across it-but even then, its exaggerated movements and overbearing demeanor make every footstep a thunderous stomp. An unexpected wayward breeze is enough to throw a stony-faced wind yai into a fit of rage, the delicate motions of nature an ever-present reminder of the wind yai's own blustering presence and lack of grace. Thus are wind yai desperate to gain some semblance of control over the capricious winds, and they use their sheer might and monstrous resolve to bend that untamable force to their will, taking pleasure in not only controlling nature, but also using it for unnatural acts of destruction. Wind yai tend to wear thick, showy robes and heavy jewelry, though their great strength still allows them to move swiftly and with ease. Like all yai, wind yai each possess a third eye through which they can emit rays of destructive energy. In the case of wind yai, this powerful beam takes the form of a lightning bolt, as the oni channel the very essence of the storm into their attacks, simultaneously electrocuting their opponents while rendering them deaf with the cacophonous boom of thunder that follows the attack. They also possess the unique ability to send their foes flying into the air, commanding bursts of wind to carry their enemies aloft and bring them crashing back to the earth. Habitat &amp; Society Cloud giants possess one other thing wind yai yearn to claim mastery over-their instruments. But rather than use such delicate tools to create melodious works of art, wind yai are interested in their more destructive properties, and have a particular respect for bards, especially those who bend others to their will with their music. Thus do they tend to seek out such rhythmically inclined individuals, and when faced with a foe who possesses musical skill, wind yai will invariably seek to keep that individual alive, so they can force it to serve as the wind yai's enslaved jester and musician. An ensnared performer is usually forced to entertain its master until its fingers are cracked and raw and it inevitably falters while playing. Wind yai are hardly patient creatures, but nothing sets them off in quite the same way as a weak or inept musician, and even the most innocent mistake can mean the fatal end for an indentured bard. When wind yai are not presented with a suitable performer to capture and dominate, they seek out magical instruments, having a particular affection for rare, magical instruments, especially those with strings. A wind yai takes great pride in its musical possessions, and also finds a unique pleasure in assembling masses of enslaved musicians to perform thunderous symphonies. Wind yai also take great pleasure in dominating cloud giants, perhaps even more so than bards, as they revere cloud giants' heavenly melodies above all others. Rather than apprehend these giants one by one, however, wind yai seek to dominate entire tribes of such beings, using their powers over the skies to trick particularly superstitious groups into thinking the oni are earthbound demigods or celestial messengers sent from on high. Groups of wind yai can be an even fiercer force, gathering entire legions of cloud giants under their command and leading them in aerial campaigns against helpless creatures on land. Evil cloud giants tend to make the best soldiers for wind yai leaders, though if the oni can manage to sway good-aligned cloud giants under their banner, the subsequent wars they wage are all the more satisfying.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Elongate Neck (Ex) A rokurokubi can stretch her otherwise normal-looking neck up to 20 feet in length, giving her reach with her bite attack and allowing her to threaten all foes within this range. In addition, she can deliver touch spells with her head. Nightfall Aura (Su) A rokurokubi can choose to surround itself with an aura that simulates the most terrifying aspects of night, creating a sphere of darkness and silence (as the spells) with a radius of 15 feet. A rokurokubi is immune to the effects of her own nightfall aura, and can activate or suppress this ability as a free action. The darkness and silence effects can each be dispelled; if either of these effects is dispelled, a rokurokubi can reactivate her nightfall aura as a free action on her next turn. Rokurokubi's Curse (Su) Curse of Silence: save Will DC 23; effect the target takes 1 point of Charisma damage per day, and its throat gradually closes in on itself, until the creature becomes permanently silenced after 1d4 days. Spells A rokurokubi casts spells as a 12th-level sorcerer.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Rokurokubis are evil, sorcerous humanoids with malevolent origins and even viler intentions. Always taking the form of women, rokurokubis seek to spread as much mayhem and despair as possible, using their wicked magic to ruin lives, tear families apart, and at worst, maim and murder innocents. Such monsters make their homes within civilized societies and disguise themselves as simple commoners, but they take the form of monstrous hags with serpentine throats during the night (and even in the shadow of daylight should the mood strike them), and delight in the taste and feeling of warm blood running down their gullets. At first glance, a rokurokubi looks much like any ordinary human woman. Upon closer inspection, however, her frail appearance and sickly hued skin begin to hint at the being's true nature. When a rokurokubi reveals her monstrous ability to stretch her neck to inhuman lengths or begins to weave her arcane sorcery, there can be no doubt as to her sheer otherworldliness. When she wills it, a rokurokubi may snake her long, rubbery neck up to 20 feet from her body. Down the length of this otherwise smooth, fleshy appendage, evenly spaced vertebrae show as sickening knobbles, lending further grotesqueness to the creature's already disturbing appearance. While most prefer to utilize their dark magic to devastate enemies from the shadows, rokurokubis are far from helpless when forced to face foes head-on, and can be exceptionally canny combatants if cornered, using their long necks to deliver devastating bites to short-limbed foes at a distance. The aura of darkness and silence that surrounds a rokurokubi makes combating the fiend difficult for creatures that rely on melee attacks to damage or disable their foes but lack the ability to see in the dark. When her neck is not distended from her body, a rokurokubi is 5-1/2 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds. Ecology Rokurokubis' wan skin ranges in hue from pale blue to muted green, and thus most cover up their flesh with makeup or wear concealing robes and gowns to disguise their identities. Their gnarly hands and fingers are perhaps the most difficult traits to hide, and thus many rokurokubis take to wearing loose-fitting gloves or clothes with oversized sleeves to mask their hands while in public. They use their bites in combat to gruesome effect, and their jagged teeth are like the creatures' necks in that they can be shortened and lengthened at will. Rokurokubis are born and raised by their mothers. In order to reproduce, a rokurokubi must seek an unsuspecting humanoid male as her partner, though she may also occasionally copulate with more monstrous creatures-race matters not to a rokurokubi, whose savage and rapacious nature knows no bounds. Regardless of her partner's race, the offspring of a rokurokubi is always a rokurokubi, and rarely do such monstrous children bear any resemblance to the father, instead acquiring almost all their features from the mother who bore them, though they undoubtedly carry a spark of the father's nature within them as well, usually manifesting as odd quirks or obsessions with particular hobbies or activities. A rokurokubi's sire rarely has the chance to see his child come into being anyway, however, as the man is usually slain immediately after he has fulfilled his purpose and his vile partner has tired of his presence. A rokurokubi's bizarre anatomy allows her to carry a child without her belly broadening noticeably, and she can even host multiple children of different fathers simultaneously, though with a third or fourth simultaneous pregnancy she does begin to show signs of fatigue as well as a widening girth, her already fragile body pushed to its absolute limits. Unlike most other monstrous humanoids, rokurokubis have no need for sleep, and are thus immune to magical effects that would cause them to do such. Nonetheless, they understand that other creatures require such rest and utilize this weakness, shaping their magic to render victims unconscious, at which point they cause their targets further harm in the form of relentless nightmares. As most other creatures sleep at night, rokurokubis prey upon unsuspecting victims during this time more than any other. Habitat &amp; Society Rokurokubis tend to make their homes in dark, dank, secret places, far from settlements and the activities of what they deem to be lesser races. Caves, long-forgotten burial mounds, and deserted or crumbling homesteads are all likely hideouts for these dangerous creatures. Solitary creatures by nature, rokurokubis leave their mothers shortly after they are old enough to survive on their own. When they do congregate, they usually do so only to execute complex, sinister plans that would be impossible to enact by themselves. Rokurokubis' affinity with the night and their unusual physiology make them natural rogues and hunters, apt as they are at peering around corners and through windows as well as trapping victims in clouds of inky blackness and silence. While some rokurokubis seek no allegiances and only wish to kill for the sheer sport of it, others see the advantages in forming tentative alliances and making themselves available as assassins and spies, and thus sell their services to those foolish or desperate enough to seek them out. The cost of such a monstrous mercenary is usually exorbitant; rokurokubis have been known to strike deals with those customers who can't afford to pay them but who still entice them with a particularly interesting or challenging job. Such bargains are usually for something even more valuable to the asker than money, often something tangible such as a first-born son or daughter (to later be stripped of flesh and eaten), ashes of a loved one, or even one or more of the hirer's limbs. Those who refuse such offers are met with either amused indifference or unforgiving hatred, the latter almost inevitably resulting in the offender's immediate death.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Rebuild (Ex) Aballonian machines are capable of improving and adapting their designs. Each Aballonian starts out with one of the abilities listed below. For every two additional abilities it possesses, its CR increases by +1. Aballonians may also add the customizable abilities of animated objects (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 14, Pathfinder Adventure Path #43 80), increasing their CRs by +1 for every 2 Construction Points spent in this way. (They are already considered metal.) Aballonians may adapt of their own volition, but it takes 1 day to add each additional ability beyond the first, and they must also possess the rare materials necessary to make such improvements. An ability can only be gained once unless stated otherwise. • Gain a plasma cutter that deals 1d6 points of fire damage on a melee touch attack. • Gain advanced treads that increase base speed to 60 feet. • Modify chassis to gain a burrow, climb, or swim speed of 60 feet. This ability may be taken multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time it is taken, it applies to a new movement type. • Add a radar dish that grants blindsight 120 feet. • Gain an additional claw or slam melee attack (1d6 damage). Lengthen arms to extend reach by 5 feet. • Gain the rend special attack (2 claws, 1d8+6). • Add armor plating to gain a +4 natural armor bonus to AC. • Harden systems to gain resistance 10 against a single energy type (acid, cold, electricity, or fire). This ability may be taken multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time it is taken, it applies to a new energy type. Shortwave (Ex) An Aballonian can communicate with nearby Aballonians via invisible waves. This functions as telepathy 100 ft., but only with other Aballonians. In combat, if any allied Aballonians within range can act in a surprise round, all of them can. Spark (Ex) As a standard action, an Aballonian can launch an arc of electricity at a nearby creature. This attack has a range of 20 feet with no range increment. In addition, whenever an Aballonian makes a check to maintain a grapple, it can use its spark attack against the creature it is grappling as a free action. Sunlight Dependency (Ex) Aballonians gain their energy from light. In areas of darkness, they gain the sickened condition.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Aballonians are intelligent, self-modifying constructs. The stat block presented here represents only the most basic type found on Aballon, with much larger or smaller variants taking the form of gargantuan excavators, gliding solar-powered flyers, ribbonlike serpent creatures, disembodied processor intelligences, or stranger designs.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Adaptation (Ex) A Brethedan's body is extremely mutable, and can adapt to respond to virtually any situation. Once per round as a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, a Brethedan can reshape its body and chemistry to adopt any of the following qualities. • Resistance 5 against a single energy type (acid, cold, electricity, or fire). • An additional natural attack (tentacle, bite, etc.) with damage appropriate to the Brethedan's size. • Change its slam damage type to slashing or piercing. • Increase its slam damage die by one step (from 1d6 to 1d8 for most Brethedans). • Gain a +4 natural armor bonus to AC. • Extend its reach to 20 feet. A Brethedan can only have one modification in effect at any one time-a Brethedan that selects a new adaptation loses any other in effect. More extreme adaptations are also possible (at the GM's discretion) but generally take days or even months to adopt. Combine (Ex) Thanks to their perfect communication, Brethedans can combine to work together as parts of a larger organism. As a swift action, a Brethedan adjacent to another can merge with it, becoming a single creature occupying both spaces. The merging Brethedan forfeits its actions to augment the other, and adds its hit points (though not its Hit Dice) to the new creature's collective total. At this time, it also chooses one adaptation-the combined creature gains this benefit, and it cannot be changed unless the combined creature uses its single adaptation action each round to do so. Any number of Brethedans can merge in this fashion, but each adaptation can be gained only once (though resistances to multiple energy types are allowed). The combined creature retains the ability to swap one adaptation each round (not once per component creature). Splitting into the component creatures again is a full-round action, in which all component creatures are released and the remaining hit points are divided evenly. For the purposes of Hit Dice-related effects, the Hit Dice of a combined Brethedan are equal to those of the component creature with the highest CR.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Brethedans are an adaptive race of floating, telepathic blimp-creatures that live on gas giant worlds. The culture disdains physical tools, instead solving problems by combining and modifying their bodies or producing tailored biological agents inside themselves. A typical Brethedan is 10 feet long and weighs 200 pounds.</Description>

    <Description>Once, the entities that would become known as Contemplatives were relatively normal humanoids, notable only for their extreme intelligence. At some point in the distant past, however, their race discovered a great secret within itself, unlocking the mind's potential for such sought-after mental powers as telekinesis. Evolution-whether natural or forced by the Contemplatives themselves-made their incredible brains the sole focus of their advancement, and as the Contemplatives grew to rely more and more on their psychic abilities, their limbs withered and shrank. Today, a Contemplative's massive brain makes up roughly 80 percent of its bodyweight. Below the pulsating and partially translucent sac that protects the vital organ, the rest of its body hangs almost vestigially, used for little more than breathing and processing food. Movement, speech, and the manipulation of objects are handled by the creatures' psychic abilities, resulting in a collection of eerily quiet figures that float slowly and precisely along the halls of their fortresses, mulling over ideas that only their advanced brains are capable of understanding. Though alien in appearance and demeanor, Contemplatives are rarely malicious; instead, when their unexplainable goals bring them into conf lict with other races, it can generally be assumed that they have good reasons for their actions, though this may be of little comfort to those inconvenienced by the far-seeing brain-people's schemes. Perhaps the most disturbing thing about the Contemplatives, however, is the chance that their abhorrent, brain-centric form may in fact be the ultimate destination of all humanoid evolution. A typical Contemplative of Ashok weighs roughly 100 pounds and measures 3 feet in diameter, though it prefers to float at the eye level of whomever it's talking to. Most become sages or arcanists, taking levels of wizard, sorcerer, bard, or other arcane spell-wielding classes; though divine casters are not unknown, most Contemplatives have little interest in the gods (or perhaps the gods take affront at the creatures' probing and presumptuous questions regarding the nature of reality). When they speak inside another creature's head, their voices are monotone and seeming to come from everywhere at once, and when multiple Contemplatives are encountered, they almost always speak as "we" rather than the individual "I."</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Rider Bond (Su) A dragonkin can form a permanent bond with its rider. Once this bond is made, a dragonkin cannot form another rider bond until its current rider dies. A dragonkin and its rider can communicate with each other as if they both had telepathy 100 ft. In combat, when a rider is mounted on his dragonkin, both creatures roll initiative separately and treat the highest result as their single result.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Somewhere between true dragons and brute drakes lie the dragonkin. Intelligent, even-tempered, and deadly in combat, dragonkin get along well with humanoids. Unlike many other dragons, dragonkin have enough dexterity in their front limbs to have adopted weapons, favoring huge glaives and long lances. The most unique aspect of dragonkin is their bond with other races. Dragonkin opposed to the depredations of evil dragons in the Drakelands recognize other cultures' potential, and such individuals often adopt humanoid riders. After it comes of age, a dragonkin may form an unbreakable partnership with a rider, who acts as a trusted comrade. In battle, a rider and her dragon are inseparable, in such constant telepathic communication that they almost seem to be one entity. When not fighting, the humanoids are responsible for caring and providing for their draconic companions, though this domestic role is more a social dynamic than outright servitude. Built for speed, dragonkin are long and sleek. Many adopt mannerisms from humanoid races, even going so far as to wear armor, and this, combined with the fact that dragonkin have thrown in their lot with humanoids, sometimes disgusts true dragons. A typical dragonkin is 15 to 20 feet long and roughly 2,000 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Capsize (Ex) An oma can attempt to capsize a spacecraft or airship by ramming it as a charge attack and making a combat maneuver check. The DC of this check is 25, or the result of the captain's Profession (sailor) check, whichever is higher. For each size category the ship is larger than the oma's size, the oma takes a cumulative -10 penalty on this combat maneuver check. Carrier (Ex) A creature swallowed whole by an oma can forgo attempts to cut itself out and instead make a DC 20 Reflex save on its turn. Success allows the creature to move into the creature's larger second stomach, where it can ride safely for an indefinite period without taking damage. When a passenger wishes to leave, it can cut its way free using the normal rules, or make an additional DC 20 Reflex save to be safely excreted in an adjacent square. An oma's carrier stomach can hold up to one Gargantuan creature (or twice as many creatures of the next smallest size, so two Huge creatures, four Large, etc.). At its option, an oma can choose to forgo the normal bite damage of swallowing whole, but not the acid damage of the first stomach. Starflight (Ex) An oma can survive in the void of outer space, and flies through vacuum at incredible speeds. Although exact travel times vary, a trip between two planets within a single solar system should take 3d20 days, while a trip to another solar system should take 3d20 weeks (or more, at the GM's discretion), provided the oma knows the way to its destination.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The titanic oma, sometimes referred to as "space whales," are some of the largest creatures spawned by the gas giant worlds. Capable of soaring through both dense gas and the vast gulfs between planets by means of magically projected electromagnetic fields, these docile beasts skim planetary atmospheres or trawl the rings of dust and ice surrounding some worlds, singing their crooning telepathic songs across great distances. Despite their size, oma are capable of feeding on even the smallest of prey, straining out life-sustaining molecules such as hydrogen with the electromagnetic fields in their energy baleen. When larger creatures or objects get in their way, however, oma are perfectly happy to swallow them as well. Anything ingested by the creatures in this fashion is blasted by electrical energy, dissolved by acid, and then sequestered in a surprisingly habitable second stomach before being eventually excreted. The Brethedans long ago took advantage of this second stomach to use the oma as living starships, telepathically guiding the colossi through the void between worlds. A typical oma is 150 feet long and weighs 250 tons.</Description>

    <Description>The fabled four-armed giants of Akiton are renowned across several worlds for their ferocity in battle. Most Shobhads are born and come of age in one of the fierce tribal clans known collectively as the Shobhad-neh, and disdain the "soft living" practiced by other humanoid races, seeing in the abandonment of nomadic culture a slippery slope that leads away from individual honor and into marginalization. Whether with flashing swords and lances or the mysterious longrifles capable of picking off targets on faraway horizons, the clans of the Shobhad-neh vie constantly for resources in the hard deserts and mountains where they live, their need to survive trumped only by a still greater desire for honor. While considered barbaric by many, the Shobhad-neh operate under strict codes of conduct that dictate how a warrior may gain status via ritualistic challenges or daring coups in territorial squabbles. Unfortunately for other races, these rules almost always apply exclusively to interactions with other Shobhads, and "lesser" races are frequently seen as little more than sheep to be culled by the Shobhad wolves. Typical shobhad warriors stand 12 feet tall and weigh 500 pounds, and their lean bodies are corded with ropes of muscle. Clothing is either practical-such as hide armor and wrappings to protect against biting sandstorms-or ceremonial, with chieftains and shamans wearing brightly colored skins and feathers, yet most shobhads prefer to go naked save for loincloths and the all-important leather harnesses that crisscross their chests and secure their weapons. While Shobhads are occasionally found alone in the various cities of Akiton, such urban individuals are the exception rather than the rule. In a human city, their shamans preach, an individual is little more than a faceless cog in a machine, remembered by none. Yet a shobhad warrior who rides heroically into battle atop her armored reptilian steed is never forgotten-not by her own kin, nor by the families of those she defeats. Thus, in battle, a Shobhad is made immortal.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Attach (Ex) When a tidepool dragon hits with a claw attack, it automatically grapples its foe, dealing automatic damage with that claw each round. Breath Weapon (Su) When a tidepool dragon uses its breath weapon underwater, it creates a 10-foot cone of superheated water rather than a line of fire (as noted above). This effect deals the breath weapon's damage to any creatures in the cone's area, though victims can still save to take only half damage.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Aquatic dragons similar in size and fickleness to faerie dragons and pseudodragons, tidepool dragons rule as whimsical tyrants over miniature realms comprising coral forests, sand dune mountains, and low-tide menageries. Preferring to inhabit coastal regions throughout the world's warmer climes, these dragon-kin make their lairs amid balmy lagoons and hidden coves, favoring any seaside setting devoid of stronger predators. A combination of chitinous shell-similar in shade to that of a blue crab-and scales the color of clear tropical waters covers every tidepool dragon, the shade deepening through twilight hues to a shade as dark as a ocean abyss. Tidepool dragons typically measure about 2 feet long and weigh approximately 14 pounds. They are known to live for about 300 years. Ecology Despite their size, tidepool dragons are hardy and well suited to their environment. Their sweeping fin-wings work equally well both above and beneath the water. While underwater, these dragons use their fins to make languid, powerful strokes, propelling them forward in graceful bursts, but the strong, flexible musculature beneath the fins also allows them to make quick, dramatic turns essential in pursing eels, small fish, and other agile prey. Above the water these same appendages work like wings, the membranous skin spreading over bones and cartilage to catch currents of air. Many observers who have glimpsed these creatures both above and below the waves claim that they do not fly so much as swim through the skies. The tiny dragons' dense muscle mass, particularly in their tails, allows them to create momentum strong enough to break the surface of the water and send them skyward in their characteristic glides. Although they prefer to eat fish, tidepool dragons often use their flight to chase seabirds off the surface of the waves and high into the sky, while the small, tough teeth that line every tidepool dragon's mouth can easily crack the hard shells of crabs and other shellfish. The tidepool dragon is amphibious, possessing both gills and lungs, and can exist outside of water indefinitely. While it is in flight, muscles stretch its gill slits so they lie flat along the body, decreasing resistance to the wind. At the apex of the dragon's complex respiratory system, near the base of the creature's throat, a pair of small bones hang down. Tidepool dragons can vibrate these bones at an almost unthinkable speed, and the furious motion gives off intense heat. They can then draw water through their bodies from their gills and push it out of their mouths. As this torrent of water passes the vibrating bones, it heats to temperatures beyond scalding, capable of burning flesh and even melting glass. Even when not submerged, tidepool dragons can draw moisture from the air through their gills to power their breath weapons. But despite the potency of a tidepool dragon's breath when used in flight or on land, these creatures usually employ their breath weapons while underwater. When the dragons are submerged, their scalding gout of water diffuses into a small cloud of boiling water, allowing them to affect entire schools of fish or other groups of prey in a single boiling burst. Habitat &amp; Society Tidepool dragons get their name from their tendency to frequent small coastal pools, where they bask and sleep because they are usually safe from other predators there and their shell-like hides blend well with the brilliant colors of local aquatic fauna. Those attempting to capture or otherwise contain a tidepool dragon find it a challenging task, as the creature's freedom of movement ability makes most nets, ropes, and simple attempts to grab it near useless. "Slippery as a tide wyrm" is a phrase often bandied about by sailors and other seafarers when trying to cross treacherously wet decks or wrestle the rigging of a loose and blowing sail. Despite being almost impossible to catch, tidepool dragons can be bargained with rather readily, as their interests, while fickle, are quite simple. Those seeking tidepool dragons' favor-or, at least, hoping not to incur their mischief-can make offerings to the dragon, typically in the form of coins, gems, or particularly shiny shells so that the miniature wyrms can mimic their larger kin. Additionally, most tidepool dragons enjoy rare fish that cannot be found in their home waters, or fruits and vegetables from far inland that they've never sampled. Capricious and self-serving, these miniature dragons possess a less savory reputation than their faerie dragon or pseudodragon cousins, making enemies as easily as they make allies. Highly territorial, most tidepool dragons take offense if the waters and coasts near their lairs are intruded upon, blasting trespassers with their breath weapons or perpetrating various pranks upon them. If satisfied, though-typically by being bribed with shiny baubles or salty food-tidepool dragons can prove quite helpful, serving other creatures for the promise of more rewards. Clever sailors have been known to leave trails of enticing foods in their ships' wakes in an effort to draw the attention of tidepool dragons. If successful, a vessel can gain a valuable helper, capable of acting as a lookout both far above and far below the water. Several aquatic species, such as merfolk, tritons, aquatic elves, and even sahuagin, also recognize the benefits of keeping tidepool dragons as allies, and some explorers have recorded colonies of such aquatic humanoids where well-fed clutches of these dragons act as sentries or scouts. When left to their own devices, tidepool dragons live in small coastal caves, usually in mated pairs or related family clutches. These lairs always contain exit shafts into the sky beyond since tidepool dragon eggs and new hatchlings are a favorite prey of bunyips. Tidepool dragon eggs are about the size of a chicken or crocodile egg, but are marked with the same colors that will eventually grace the hatchlings' scales. Parents hatch their young and then raise them until they are capable of surviving on their own, around age 3. At that point, young tidepool dragons set off to find mates and indulge their species' rampant curiosity. Single youths also band together to form non-familial pods for hunting and adventure. Tidepool Dragons as Familiars Although difficult to approach, tidepool dragons sometimes choose to serve as the familiars of unruly spellcasters and those who go out of their way to feed them rich or exotic foods. Spellcasters of 7th level or higher with an alignment within one step of chaotic neutral can gain a tidepool dragon as a familiar by taking the Improved Familiar feat.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Puppetmaster (Su) As a full-round action, an incutilis can drive its lesser tendrils into any helpless Small or Medium creature it occupies the same square as, and pump the victim full of poison and chemicals. The victim is killed instantly and becomes a zombielike creature under the incutilis's control. This zombie is not treated as being undead, and is immune to spells and effects that only affect undead (like damage from positive energy). The incutilis is attached to this zombie-typically by the head-occupying the same square and moving along with it. The incutilis can make attacks with its tentacles independently of the zombie's slam. It can also retract its tendrils as a move action, but doing so causes the zombie to collapse and revert to a normal corpse. The incutilis must retract its tendrils before it can move away from a zombie it's attached to. Any attack that deals damage to the zombie also deals 1 point of damage to the incutilis, regardless of how much damage is dealt to the zombie, while area-affecting spells affect both the puppeteer and zombie. A character can attempt to attack just the incutilis, but takes a -4 penalty on the attack roll. Killing the incutilis destroys the zombie.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Scholars know life began in the sea, and some- either paranoid or visionary-claim that the sea has manipulated the course of humanoid life through ages beyond reckoning, citing the incutilis as evidence of this. A strange sort of sea creature that appears to be little more than an oversized cephalopod, an incutilis hides a significant intelligence behind its unassuming appearance. Though most incutilises live their entire lives amid the deepest trenches of the darkest seas, some venture to the border between water and land, revealing terrible control over land-dwelling flesh and an alien disregard for sentient life. Limited in their ability to cross this border and travel on land by their aquatic physiologies, these aberrations overcome this hurdle with a lethal solution, slaying land dwellers and commandeering their flesh to bear the incutilis on shore. To what ends these beings seek to explore the surface remains a mystery-perhaps they do so out of hunger, perhaps out of curiosity, or perhaps because they were sent. A typical incutilis weighs approximately 25 pounds, 30 with its shell, and measures 4 feet from the tips of its longest tentacles to the top of its shell. Ecology Although incutilises can live as bottom feeders, their favorite foods seem to be higher life forms-sharks, whales, and sentient ocean dwellers-and they appear to make little distinction between the living and the dead. They also make no obvious distinctions between sentient and nonsentient victims, a trait that comes across as either an extreme form of racial arrogance or total ruthlessness. At the same time, incutilises exhibit strong self-preservation compulsions, going out of their way to avoid dangerous predators and large groups of other sentient beings, and preferring instead to operate from the shadows. Incutilises' most remarkable physical process is their ability to invasively take over dead flesh. So long as a body is relatively intact, the aberration can extend the smaller, more delicate tendrils it typically keeps retracted into its shell. These tendrils are covered with myriad tiny barbs and smaller fibrous filaments it can wind into even the finest internal apertures of a living body with shocking speed and ease. Once the tendrils are in place, the strange chemical laboratory that makes up a incutilis's internal organs allows it to secrete strange chemicals and toxins directly into the body's muscles, causing deliberate contractions, releases, and convulsions that give freshly dead bodies the semblance of life, while those longer dead appear undead. This process requires the incutilis to be latched onto its victim, directing its every motion. If it retracts its tendrils, its host body collapses back into a pile of dead flesh. Despite the remarkable nature of incutilises' corpse animation process, it is far from subtle. An incutilis cannot easily hide its prominent tendrils and gleaming shell, meaning that any corpse looks far from normal in well-lit conditions. In the dark or at a distance, however, the illusion can prove somewhat convincing, though still unnerving as the body twitches and jerks with the spasms caused by its aquatic master. Typically, witnesses who see a corpse animated by an incutilis believe it to be some sort of waterlogged undead, a misidentification that has led to the demise of more than one well-intentioned cleric. Incutilises can survive both on land and at sea, though they are at an obvious disadvantage out of water, as their bodies are specialized for swimming, not dragging themselves along dry terrain. This limit to their mobility seems to be the primary reason they seek out corpses to take control over or unsuspecting humanoids or animals to overwhelm, claiming their bodies as convenient conveyances. Despite this, their actions rarely seem deliberately malicious, but rather result from a decision made out of dispassionate necessity. Whether they realize that their method of taking over the bodies of other living creatures is an affront to such beings or even have any concept of what death means proves entirely unclear. Habitat &amp; Society Those few aware of incutilises rarely know the creatures by name. Rather, tales of their terrors-of shambling, flesh-garbed cephalopods and whole villages overwhelmed by invaders from the deep-spread through ports and among crews of sailors, the stuff of tall tales and the lies of drunks. But regularly enough, coastal fishing communities or the fortresses of petty pirate kings turn up deserted, their occupants vanished except, occasionally, for a few strange, oversized nautilus shells. Incutilises can turn up in nearly any body of saltwater, but seem to favor warmer climes. More than even seeking warmer waters, however, these aquatic aberrations most frequently appear near deep undersea trenches. This is possibly because of some preference for the pressure of the depths or the darkness, but some also propose that incutilises are natives of the Darklands and inhabit the lightless seas of that realm in numbers unprecedented in the seas of the surface. This somewhat unpredictable range of habits has resulted in rumors of incutilises appearing in the most unusual places, like freshwater ponds, inland fishing holes, even wells. Incutilises prove highly logical in their decision-making, seeming to know nothing of or care nothing for emotion or sympathy. This causes many who first encounter them to believe they're nothing more than ravenous creatures, flesh stealers driven to hunt beyond their native environments. In truth, groups of incutilises act with great eff iciency and deliberateness. Such bands also gauge the potential of a possible new food source before acting to claim it, avoiding acts that would eliminate their entire food source too quickly. They might kill off a few coastal communities, but avoid wiping out entire coastal populations in a region. In other cases, a group of corpse-riding incutilises might capture a signif icant portion of a community's population, trapping their victims in sea caves where the incutilises can come an go as they please, where others of their race can come and collect bodies to use on land, or where their prey are sequestered like herd animals.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Fighter Training (Ex) The herald counts its Hit Dice as fighter levels for the purpose of qualifying for feats and other abilities. Keelhaul (Ex) If the herald hits a creature with two or more incorporeal touch attacks in 1 round, it can perform a reposition combat maneuver as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If the herald moves the target into or through a square adjacent to it (including over or under itself ), the target takes 1d6 points of slashing or bludgeoning damage (herald's choice) for every 5 feet of this movement. If this movement results in the target being underwater, the target must hold its breath or begin to drown. Alternatively, if the herald can reposition the target to the center of its space, it can attempt to force the target into its cargo hold and snap the doors shut, holding the target in place as the swallow whole ability. The herald can hold up to four Medium or smaller creatures or one Large creature with this ability. Rush (Ex) Once per minute for 1 round, the herald can move at a swim speed of 150 feet, even downward. Telekinesis (Su) The herald makes ranged attacks by telekinetically hurling objects or creatures on its deck as weapons. This ability functions as the spell telekinesis (CL 18th). It can use the ability on objects or creatures of up to 375 pounds, dealing 1d6 points of damage per 25 pounds of the hurled object or creature. If the herald attempts to hurl a creature with this ability, that creature can resist the effect with a successful Will save (DC 18). The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Besmara's herald is Kelpie's Wrath, a haunted ship that is a living being. It looks like a storm-battered pirate vessel with the skull and spine of some great sea creature mounted on the prow, with eerie lights flickering on its deck and streaming from its masts. The ship is the source of many horror tales of abandoned ships found in the ocean or spectral ships crewed by ghosts, but it is actually an independent creature with a malign, vengeful intelligence. On the rare occasions when it comes to the mortal seas at Besmara's bidding, it usually does so to punish some buccaneer for a horrid blasphemy against the Pirate Queen. Far more often it is left to its own devices, sailing mortal waters, the Ethereal or Astral Planes, or strange dream-realms in search of plunder, danger, and glory. The ship's origins are mysterious and legends about it are contradictory. In some stories it was originally the flagship of a notorious pirate king who swore to forever serve Besmara, and when he finally died she merged his spirit with his ship so he could continue his service. Other tales tell of a demon-tainted kelpie that grew to a monstrous size and was kept as a beloved pet by the goddess like a mad dog until it was slain by adventurers and resurrected in this form to continue its predations. Still others speak of a devout priest-captain of Besmara who swore to bed no other woman so he could service the goddess in the afterlife, but then fell in love with a girl in a coastal village; according to this tale, the goddess cursed the priest to always roam the sea and never touch land so he would always pine for the love he could not have. The ship does not answer queries about its origin, and if pressed on the matter it has a habit of grabbing its interrogators, diving hundreds of feet under the water, and casually watching them gasp out the last of their air before it tears them limb from limb. The ship is completely animate and needs no crew- it can tie and release its lines; raise, lower, and adjust its sails; open or close all of its doors; and so on. It moves about foreign objects (such as cargo) using telekinesis, and it sometimes does the same to its rare passengers, slamming doors on hands or throwing people overboard if it feels a lack of respect. Though it has a wheel and rudder, it resists mortal attempts to steer it as if it were a mundane ship- something it considers very disrespectful. Ecology Kelpie's Wrath has no need to eat, drink, or even breathe. Because it can "swim" in any direction, including underwater, it may be found on the surface, cruising deep beneath the sea, or even skimming the bottom of the ocean. If facing an opponent it cannot easily defeat, it is likely to retreat deep underwater (assuming its foe cannot easily follow) or use teleport or plane shift to reach a safe place. It prods old wrecked ships for loot, storing its prizes within itself and only relinquishing its treasures when the goddess desires something it carries. Many loot caches on the sea floor actually belong to the ship, buried and marked in its memory for later counting. When called by mortals, it demands treasure as payment for its services, preferring chests full of gems and gold coins. It has a lecherous, voyeuristic streak, however, and has been known to lower its price if arrangements are made for mortals to perform carnal acts on its decks-while it telepathically murmurs approvingly. If properly bribed, it serves with grudging loyalty until the task is done, then leaves. It is best suited for tasks requiring the destruction or terrorizing of enemy ships or fleets, though it can easily transport dozens of people or tons of cargo anywhere in the world or even to another plane. It is also willing to serve as a lure or decoy, disguising itself as a slow, loot-rich merchant vessel or mysterious shipwreck in a cove. The ship is fully mobile in waterlike environments on other planes, including the Ethereal and Astral Planes. It enjoys sailing the "waters" of the ethereal sea and raiding xill settlements, or changing through clusters of soul-predators in the Astral Plane. It also finds pleasure in the bizarre seascape of the Maelstrom and has ventured into watery parts of the Abyss, though it is always ready to plane shift if it suspects a trap or a shift in the terrain that would trap it. Habitat &amp; Society Kelpie's Wrath sometimes follows Besmara's ship, the Seawraith, at a respectful distance on its travels through the planes, like a well-heeled dog afraid to attract too much attention to itself. When commanded by the goddess, it immediately complies, mixing a need for approval with an abject fear of punishment for any perceived disobedience. The ship acts like the only thing it cares about is the goddess, and is willing to sacrifice itself for her approval-it would swim through lava or acid, or run itself aground on a beach of adamantine spikes to please her. Though the ship has no need of crew, it sometimes offers to save drowning sailors in exchange for a number years of service. Those who accept vanish and are not seen again-unless the draugr it summons are actually the revenant forms of these rescued sailors. Whether these souls think half-life at the ship's beck and call is better than actual death is unknown, for they do not speak of it. Some pirate-priests believe the ship is searching for a soul great enough to take its place, becoming the new mind in charge of the living ship and freeing whatever controls it to live again or pass on to Pharasma's Boneyard.</Description>

    <Description>These flightless birds typically inhabit isolated tropical islands devoid of predators. Their size and unfamiliarity with natural dangers contribute to a kind of racial boldness-or what some would call stupidity-causing them to bumble into precarious situations and making them easy targets for other creatures. The birds can easily be caught and slain, but their meat has a most unpleasant taste. Few shipwrecked sailors would turn it down, however.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Hold Breath (Ex) A dwarf caiman can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to 4 x its Constitution score before it risks drowning. Sprint (Ex) Once per minute, a dwarf caiman may sprint, increasing its land speed to 20 feet for 1 round.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Dwarf caimans are a small species of crocodilian predators that live primarily amid the fast-running streams of tropical rainforests and nearby coastal waters. While hunting birds, lizards, fish, and other small prey, these patient predators sometimes lie in awkward positions for hours before they strike, their mottled scales making them appear to be nothing more than floating wood.</Description>

    <Description>Giant isopods are carnivorous scavengers that scour the ocean's floor. They vaguely resemble the common woodlouse in appearance, though they can grow to be up to 2-1/2 feet long and weigh nearly 4 pounds.

They prefer rocky beaches, upon which they rest, raise their young, and dive to hunt fish, squid, sea birds, and other small aquatic creatures. They are well known for their vocal communications consisting of barks, grunts, and flipper slaps, traits that cause many humanoids to remark on their intelligence and the ease with which they can be trained.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Breath Weapon (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds, an Aashaq's wyvern can emit a cloud of noxious fire in a 30-foot cone that deals 6d6 points of fire damage. Creatures that take damage are also temporarily blinded by the fumes as though by glitterdust for 4 rounds. A DC 19 Reflex save halves the fire damage and negates the glitterdust effect. The save DC is Consitution-based. Poison (Ex) Sting-injury; save Fort DC 19; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Con; cure 2 consecutive saves.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Aashaq's wyverns resemble the typical wyverns commonly found throughout the Inner Sea region in many regards, but they have been warped by magic. Unlike their more mundane cousins, these wyverns have bifurcated tails that allow for two stinging attacks, and are able to emit a noxious blast of gas that burns and blinds those in its path. Aashaq's wyverns reside in the natural caves that honeycomb the cliffs of Dahak's Teeth, and were common wyverns until the evil dragon Aashaq commandeered the islands. Seeing these beasts as the perfect deacons for her dark cult, Aashaq twisted the very fabric of the wyverns until she settled upon the form now most commonly encountered on Dahak's Teeth. Their very name is indicative of the wyverns' servitor status, and they are occasionally even ridden as mounts by Dahak cultists. Aashaq gives her wyvern minions a remarkable amount of freedom, but most never stray too far from the three islands that make up Dahak's Teeth. Mariners who make their way past the dreaded isles know to watch out for the beasts, which assail unprepared ships from both sky and water in order to feed upon their crews and capture their cargo for Aashaq. The corrupting inf luence of Aashaq's chaotic manipulations has also provided these unpredictable creatures with resistance to acid, fire, and magic. A typical Aashaq's wyvern is 18 feet in length (including its bifurcated tail) and weighs 2,500 pounds. Their scales can vary in tint, but are usually purple. Though only slightly more intelligent than their common kin, the Dahak-worshiping wyverns enjoy lording their "superior" status over the lesser specimens found on other islets.</Description>

    <Description>Priests of Besmara are common fixtures on pirate vessels sailing the Shackles, simultaneously serving as healers and spiritual guides for comrades who often have no time for religion until death is already grinning in their faces. While clerics of Besmara often end up captaining ships of their own, they usually spend most of their pirating careers as first mates or ship's surgeons. When not needed to confront a more immediate peril, a cleric of Besmara sees to the health of the crew, purifying spoiled food and water, healing the inevitable injuries sailors acquire in the course of their duties, or curing crew members of the diseases so widespread in the tropics and the sordid brothels that are a staple of every seaside town. If these duties spare her any time, a Besmaran priest goes out of her way to assist others in their tasks onboard and learn everything there is to know about running a ship and crew, for there is no telling what duties will be required aboard Besmara's own Seawraith should the cleric earn a coveted berth in the afterlife. In addition, every priest of Besmara is expected to make a pilgrimage to the mysterious island called Besmara's Throne at least once in her life, and shipmates greeting a cleric upon her return are often struck by the renewed fervor with which she sets about her tasks.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Blood Link (Su) Three times per day as a standard action, the Blood Queen may psychically link to up to 23 Hit Dice of kuru within 100 feet of either itself or one of its kuru surrogates; it may choose which specific kuru it would like to affect with this ability, but HD that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. Any kuru linked to in this way must succeed at a DC 28 Will save or be forced to carry out the Blood Queen's telepathic commands to the best of its ability. In addition, a linked kuru gains a +4 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution and is immune to mind-affecting effects. The blood link lasts for 1 minute or until the Blood Queen ends the effect (a free action). When the blood link is broken, the affected kuru takes 1 point of Intelligence damage and cannot be linked to again for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based. Horrifying Bellow (Su) Three times per day as a standard action, the Blood Queen can release a terrifying bellow that affects a 30-foot-radius spread. Any creature within the affected area must succeed at a DC 34 Will save or be paralyzed for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based. Surrogate Senses (Su) In addition to its blindsight, the Blood Queen can constantly see and hear through its unholy kuru surrogates as though with a permanent clairaudience/ clairvoyance spell. If at any time one of the Blood Queen's surrogates is killed, it is dazed for 1 round. Unholy Gestation (Ex) Whenever the Blood Queen swallows an unconscious humanoid or renders a humanoid unconscious with its swallow whole ability, it moves the victim through its digestive track, where the victim no longer takes damage, but rather begins to gestate within the Blood Queen's transformative stomach for 1d4 rounds. After the creature has finished gestating, it is regurgitated from the hindquarters of the Blood Queen, encased in an opaque mucous pod. Any attempt to remove a gestated humanoid from its pod causes massive system shock, and the humanoid takes 6d6 points of damage unless it succeeds at a DC 25 Fortitude save or those releasing it succeed at a DC 25 Heal check. As a swift action, the Blood Queen can send strong telepathic emanations to any pod within 100 feet, causing it to violently explode. The resulting spray of bilious ooze deals 6d6 points of acid damage to the creature encased in the pod and to any creatures in a 15-foot-radius burst. Alternatively, the Blood Queen may allow an encased humanoid to continue to gestate for at least 24 hours, and after that duration may release the fully metamorphosed creature from its pod at any point. When released, the victim completes its transformation into a kuru surrogate (see the Kuru Surrogate section below). The Blood Queen may create any number of pods, but can only possess up to six kuru surrogates at any one time (if the Blood Queen releases a seventh kuru surrogate from its mucus pod, the oldest surrogate immediately dies no matter where it is and the Blood Queen is dazed for 1 round). The save DCs are Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Millennia ago, when the repugnant cyclops empire of Ghol-Gan populated the Shackles, its foul and alien gods sent powerful servants from beyond to act as their intermediaries, guiding and corrupting the empire until its ignominious collapse, at which point the gods and their minions fled Golarion altogether. However, one of these vile servants remained even after Ghol-Gan's collapse, a wretched horror known as the Blood Queen. It has dwelt for centuries in its foul subterranean chamber in a ruined Ghol-Gan temple called Ganagsau in the Cannibal Isles, and it was this blasphemous being who transformed the kuru into the degenerate race they are today, convincing them that it is a living goddess worthy of their veneration. The Blood Queen has a kuru high priest who goes by the name Bukrugsor, and this devoted thrall sees to it that his dark patron is brought regular sacrificial victims and offerings of blood. The Blood Queen has no eyes, per se-rather, what look like angry pustules all over its bloated body act as sensory organs. In addition, it is able to see and hear the world through the various kuru surrogates its followers have interspersed throughout the Cannibal Isles. Its grotesque mouth is capable of articulating a number of languages, though if it deigns to speak with a creature it usually does so via its telepathy. While the Blood Queen uses the short tentacles that extend from its mouth to devour prey and sacrificial offerings, the tentacles that emanate from its hindquarters are long, muscular, and tipped with bonelike stingers that allow it to manipulate objects and electrify victims. The Blood Queen is nearly immobile, being a massive, swollen beast that sits in the middle of a huge underground temple chamber in its ruined cathedral. While it may slowly undulate its bulk in one direction or another, in the years since its appearance on Golarion, the Blood Queen has grown far too large to fit through any of the limestone chamber's exits. Only the Blood Queen's high priest, those destined to become surrogate kuru, or sacrifices to the behemoth monster are allowed within this foul throne room. Sometimes unwilling sacrifices are dropped into the chamber from a hole in the ceiling and the exits are sealed so that the Blood Queen may toy with its food before it feeds. A being of monumental evil, the Blood Queen expresses its rage at its divine abandonment by spreading as much pain and havoc as it can. Whether it ever escapes its ancient, self-made prison remains to be seen, though all right-thinking creatures that know of its existence shudder at the prospect. Kuru Surrogates The Blood Queen's favored deacons are known as kuru surrogates, and such monstrosities are created when the horror digests a creature and entombs the victim in one of its paralytic sacs for long enough. The creature that emerges is essentially brain-dead, having been completely stripped of its wits and nervous system. A kuru surrogate remains in its vegetative state until it starves, is killed, or is affected by a heal spell or a similar effect of equal or greater power. Kuru surrogates are revered among the Blood Queen's devout, who transport the immobile things around the Cannibal Isles, perpetually caring for the "blessed" individuals. The Blood Queen acts through these surrogates and uses them to augment and command its kuru followers, linking with its minions in order to capture any who oppose it or its wicked cult of cannibals.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Blessed Trill (Su) Once per day as a standard action, a chickcharney can emit a melodious trill that grants all creatures within a 20-foot radius a +1 morale bonus on saving throws for the rest of the day. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect. Ill Luck (Su) When a chickcharney hits a creature with one of its natural attacks, the target is exposed to the chickcharney's curse. Curse of Ill Luck: save Will DC 14; effect the creature takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks. A creature can be affected by a curse of ill luck multiple times (up to a maximum cumulative penalty of -4). Chickcharneys are immune to this curse. The save DC is Charisma-based. Maddening Screech (Su) Three times per day as a standard action, a chickcharney can emit a piercing cry that affects all other creatures within a 30-foot radius. An affected creature must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or become confused for 1d3 rounds. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Chelish explorers first came upon this strange magical bird during their early voyages to the Shackles. While the unusual creature was initially laughed at for its unsightly appearance and awkward gait, the tempestuous bird has nonetheless proven to be a force to be reckoned with in its own way. A chickcharney can grant good luck to those it deems worthy of its gifts, but its favor can just as easily turn to scorn, and a mere scratch from a chickcharney's accursed beak or claws has spelled the end for countless unwary seafarers. Naturally curious and trusting, chickcharneys freely approach most non-threatening humanoids, even accompanying them for short times and often leaving their nesting spots unprotected if they have no eggs or mate. However, they are fickle things, and if they recognize hostility or rudeness, they inf lict all manner of chaos upon those who provoke them. Chickcharneys fiercely protect their eggs and young, their eggs being highly coveted by predators as well as humanoids. The shells are thought to possess alchemical properties that can be employed in numerous formulae, and many alchemists are willing to pay exorbitant sums for intact specimens. While some pirates of the Shackles continue to insist that encountering a chickcharney is a good omen, a much larger contingent gives the ornery and erratic bird a wide berth. A chickcharney is 3 feet tall and weighs 50 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Aquatic Reconstruction (Ex) Whenever a coral golem is touching a body of saltwater of a size equal to or greater than its own size, it gains fast healing 5. Immunity to Magic (Ex) A coral golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. • Any spell with the water descriptor heals a coral golem of 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster (maximum 10d6). • Transmute rock to mud slows a coral golem (as the slow spell) for 1d6 rounds (no save). • Transmute mud to rock increases the golem's bleed damage to 2d6 for 3 rounds. • Soften earth and stone causes a coral golem to lose its damage reduction for 3 rounds. Powerful Blows (Ex) A coral golem applies 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier on damage rolls made with its slam attacks and threatens a critical hit on a roll of 19-20.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Coral golems are constructs made entirely of a colony of living coral drawn from the ocean. While their sharpened appendages are capable of performing tasks that require meticulous precision, they are equally useful in martial combat. Wizards and sorcerers employ these golems to collect delicate specimens of plant life from local beaches, spear and retrieve fish from the ocean for meals, and protect valuable locations such as their master's home or veins of minerals and other potent resources. A coral golem is 9 feet tall and weighs 1,000 pounds. Construction A coral golem's body is made of a healthy colony of living coral weighing at least 1,000 pounds, infused with rare organic substances and minerals worth 3,500 gp. Coral Golem CL 11th; Price 57,500 gp CONSTRUCTION Requirements Craft Construct, animate object, geas/quest, keen edge, limited wish, water breathing, creator must be caster level 11th; Skill Craft (sculpture) DC 15; Cost 30,500 gp</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Ravenous Hounds (Sp) Once per day as a standard action, a duppy can bring into being a pack of incorporeal hounds for 1d4+3 rounds. The ravenous hounds attack as a single unit, have a +11 attack bonus, deal 2d6+3 points of force damage on a successful hit, and threaten a critical hit on a natural 20. This ability is otherwise identical to mage's sword (CL 7th). Resurrection Vulnerability (Su) A raise dead or similar spell cast on a duppy destroys it (Will negates). Using the spell in this way does not require a material component. Strength Drain (Su) Creatures hit by a duppy's touch attack must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Strength drain. On each successful attack, the duppy gains 5 temporary hit points. The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>A duppy is the spirit of a cruel and brutal sailor who died by violence on land, away from his ship and crew, and thus was unable to receive a proper burial at sea. While its ghostly form is evidence enough of its twisted hatred, a duppy also possesses power over a pack of faithful, otherworldly hounds that share in their master's malignance. Duppies typically seek out sailors and pirates to exact their vengeance on, seeking to inf lict great violence on those living creatures who remind them of what they lost in life. For this reason, duppies are most often found in seaside towns or nearby beaches, and settlements that rely on the ocean know to fear and hate these ghastly beings. The presence of a duppy is often preceded by the distant sound of unearthly howling. While a duppy's incorporeal form ensures that it cannot be captured via mundane means, those who do manage to trick a duppy into a trap are wise to keep the horror confined until day, when its otherworldly abilities are hindered and it can be more easily defeated. However, few creatures can muster powers strong enough to cage a duppy, whose hounds confound enemies and allow the ghostly monster to attack victims from all sides.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Blinding Breath (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds, a gholdako can exhale its noxious breath in a 20-foot cone, permanently blinding any creatures in the affected area unless they succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save. The save DC is Charisma-based. Disease (Ex) Seaside rot-claw; save Fort DC 22; onset 1 minute; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Str and 1d4 Dex; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>A gholdako is a dreadful undead cyclops created by the foul priests and necromancers of the fallen empire of Ghol- Gan thousands of years ago. A gholdako's eyeball is sunken and milky, and its body and limbs are wrapped tightly in ragged strips of soiled linens much like a mummy, though disturbing and incomprehensible glyphs remain scribbled on the ancient cloth, written in what appears to be dried blood. Layers of skin continually flake off of the monster's parched, exposed flesh, which is a sickly, pale yellow. The average gholdako stands 9 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds. Gholdakos are nearly always guardians of some special relic or tomb in Ghol-Gan ruins, having been ordered to protect the object or location in life and remaining faithful to their duties even after dying. While they strive to keep their wards safe from depredations, gholdakos are nonetheless short-tempered and easy to lure away from their posts, though being caught by the undead giant almost always spells a gruesome and untimely end for most would-be tricksters. Dread Gholdako (+1 CR): Some gholdakos were created specifically to guard the tombs of Ghol-Gan royalty. Such dread gholdakos possess a bluish-white halo of smoke around their perpetually peeling scalps. A dread gholdako generally possesses additional Hit Dice, and can inf lict paralysis (1d4 rounds, DC 10 + 1/2 dread gholdako's racial HD + dread gholdako's Con modifier) on its foes with its bite attack.</Description>

    <Description>Perhaps nowhere in the Inner Sea region are tengus a more common sight than aboard a pirate vessel in the Shackles. Superstitious by nature, many sailors in this region have assigned to these feathered humanoids the dual role of good luck charm and mascot, based on the misguided belief that tengus can absorb ill omens and bad luck. Where this notion came from is anyone's guess, though some scholars have suggested that tengus may have been confused with the chickcharney, with whom they have nothing in common aside from their feathered forms. While this old sailor's conceit may earn such tengus, referred to as "jinx eaters," some special treatment aboard ship, perhaps exempting them from the rough bullying so common in pirate crews, it does not mean they do not have the same responsibilities and duties of all mariners engaged in piracy. Jinx eaters must be able to hold their own in a fight, though most adopt methods of avoiding such conf licts altogether, honing their skills of guile and misdirection instead of brawn and steel. Jinx eaters are typically mad for plunder, especially seeking out jewelry and other such baubles, at times even lifting them from unsuspecting shipmates. Such pilfering inevitably leads to angry confrontations onboard, and the kleptomaniacal tengu must rely on his reputation as a source of good luck if he is to be spared a severe beating at the hands of his cohorts. Several settlements around the Shackles host rookeries of decent size, and it is common to find retired jinx eaters in such districts; often these are particularly boastful individuals who have given up on the life at sea or have been ousted from their old ship by their increasingly jaded crew members.</Description>

Kuru Characters Kuru are defined by their class levels (they don't possess racial Hit Dice) and have the following racial traits. +2 Dexterity, +2 Constitution, -2 Intelligence: Kuru are abnormally fast and hardy, but bloodlust clouds their thinking. Low-Light Vision: In dim light, kuru can see twice as far as humans. Blood Courage: See above. Cannibalistic Vitality: See above. Light Sensitivity: See the universal monster rules in the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary. Natural Weapon: Kuru possess a natural bite attack that deals 1d6 points of damage.

    <SpecialAbilities>Befuddling Gaze (Su) Three times per day as a standard action, a larabay can employ a befuddling gaze attack in a 30-foot cone. Creatures that fail a DC 21 Will save become dazed for 1d4 rounds. Creatures that successfully save are dazzled for 1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based. Mischief (Su) A larabay can channel its magical energy through whatever one-handed weapon it wields to mystify and disorient foes. Creatures hit by a larabay's weapon must make a DC 21 Will save or take 1 point of Dexterity damage and become confused for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Larabays are capricious fey creatures that gravitate toward coastal regions with warm and temperate islands. They are especially fond of toying with sailors and fishermen, playing pranks aboard ships or in seaside towns by assuming various shapes and using their otherworldly powers of mischief. A larabay's idea of fun can quickly become quite serious, however, when its love of trickery begins to outweigh its sympathy for humanity, and a larabay's well-executed joke may result in a potentially fatal situation for those involved. In their never-ending pursuit of a good laugh, larabays have been known to employ their supernatural illusions to draw ships and their crews into precarious situations such as hazardous waters or hidden shoals, and the depredations of a larabay are often only realized after it's too late. On land, larabays entice their unknowing dupes off cliffs' edges, through monster lairs, or into hidden ravines or pools of quicksand. Larabays use their shapechanging abilities to craft intricate webs of social intrigue, though such schemes are always concocted in an effort simply to conduct a masterful hoax, usually resulting in the devastation or heartbreak of one or more of the parties involved rather than any concrete gains on the fey's part. While larabays have been known to inadvertently perform acts of good in the process of gulling cruel-hearted individuals, their unpredictable and precarious natures make them difficult allies, and one can never be sure just how long a larabay will remain faithful to a particular cause before getting bored or whether its companions are simply its latest victims.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Poisonous Suckers (Ex) A creature constricted by a lusca's tentacles is exposed to its deadly venom. Lusca Venom: Constrict-injury; save Fort DC 28; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Dex; cure 2 consecutive saves. Rend Ship (Ex) As a full-round action, a lusca can attempt to use four of its tentacles to grapple a ship of its size or smaller by making a combat maneuver check opposed by the ship's captain's Profession (sailor) check; the lusca receives a cumulative +4 bonus on the check for each size category smaller than Gargantuan the ship is. If the lusca grapples the ship, it holds the ship motionless; it can attack targets anywhere on or within the ship with its tentacles, but can't attack foes at all with its shark heads. Each round it maintains its hold on the ship, it automatically deals bite damage to the ship's hull. Tenacious Grapple (Ex) A lusca does not gain the grappled condition if it grapples a foe with its tentacles.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Luscas are among the most feared predators in the open ocean, their snapping shark heads and writhing tentacles spelling the end for many crews. A lusca's presence can first be felt in the air, as its body naturally conducts electricity, and sailors who have encountered the being claim that thunderclouds seem to roll in alongside the creature. Ravenous and unpredictable, a lusca claims wide swaths of territory in order to maximize the number of ships it can sink and crews it can feast upon. While luscas prefer to make quick meals of the sailors onboard a ship, they will eat just about any aquatic creature, and even giant octopuses and whales know to steer clear of a hungry lusca. The average lusca is 90 feet from tentacle to snout and weighs 3,800 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Hypnotic Display (Ex) Once per day as a standard action, a nirento can sway and dance in such a way that it attracts any who see the tree within a 60-foot radius. Any creatures other than nirentos in the area must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or become entranced by the nirento's graceful movements, thereafter believing the nirento to be a perfectly normal tree. Affected creatures become passive for 1d6 minutes and refuse to attack the nirento during this time. Affected creatures can attempt a new Will save each round that the nirento attacks an ally-if a hypnotized creature is attacked by the nirento, it gains a +4 bonus on its Will save to see through the hypnotic display. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Nirentos are predatory plants with brutish intelligence, their thorny vines able to tear foes limb from limb. A nirento lures prey toward it by swaying its branches and vines in a visually stimulating dance, striking at victims mercilessly once they are within range of its natural weapons. Slain prey then piles up around the tree's base and is absorbed through its roots. Nirentos' spongy bodies ensure they absorb most physical blows, though they remain susceptible to slashes and cuts, and when so injured, a translucent green sap oozes from their wounds. Elder nirentos are individuals that have lived for well over a century, and have absorbed nutrients from countless victims over the years. A typical nirento is 15 feet tall and weighs 1,000 pounds, while elder nirentos can reach heights of up to 25 feet and weigh over a ton.</Description>

A judicious application of diplomacy, intimidation, charm, and inducement is necessary to maintain one's position as captain, and while most pirate captains are elected by their crews, they are just as easily unelected, either by vote or a well-placed blade. Pirate captains are typically both fighters and rogues, as the occupation necessitates a strong arm as well as a firm grasp over various skills. Clerics also make for potent leaders, their ability to confront various perils emboldened by their comprehension of divine powers as well as magical anomalies.</Description>

    <Description>Officers are the captain's most trusted mates, individuals who see to it that their leader's orders are obeyed and ensure the ship's safety and autonomy. Many officers are either bards or fighters, though any seasoned buccaneer who gains the captain's trust may take on such a role. Dealing directly with grievances, identifying troublemakers, meting out punishments, and advising the captain are all part of a pirate officer's daily duties.</Description>

    <Description>The average pirate is a free-spirited renegade who would have great difficulty surviving in the cultured depths of polite, civilized society. Rogues and fighters typically make up the majority of a pirate ship's crew of sailors, as they possess both the skill and brawn necessary for day-to-day raids and heists. These colorful, adventurous characters chafe at society's laws and restrictions, and the exciting life of the buccaneer is well suited to pirates' ferocious independence.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Acid Jet (Ex) Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a sea scourge can shoot a stream of acidic juices in a 30-foot line, dealing 2d8 points of acid damage to any creatures in the area (DC 18 Reflex save for half damage). The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>On watch at night in warm seas, wise sailors are especially vigilant for the hated sea scourge, an ooze that has adapted itself so well to its maritime habitat as to become a significant hazard to native oceanic creatures as well as to humanoid seafarers. While its typical diet consists of sea turtles, dugongs, and other aquatic prey, the sea scourge will feed on whatever creatures it can manage to get a hold of, and is known to prey on humanoids both in shallow waters and at sea, even going so far as to board seagoing vessels. A sea scourge's acid is capable of dissolving wood in addition to flesh and bone, making it a particularly dangerous threat to most boats. Though it can swim beneath the waves indefinitely, a sea scourge more often tends to search the surface of the ocean for prey, camouf laged as a large clump of ambergris or other seaborne excretion. Variant Sea Scourges Most sea scourges are encountered off the western coast of Garund in the Arcadian Ocean, but some breeds have been known to stalk other parts of the high seas. Coldwater Scourge (+0 CR): Stalking the watery expanses of the northern Arcadian Ocean and Inner Sea, the coldwater scourge is a menace to merchant ships and war galleons alike. A coldwater scourge is immune to cold damage, and creatures that fail their Ref lex saves versus the scourge's acid jet are also staggered for 1 round. Steaming Scourge (+1 CR): The steaming scourge plagues the open waters of the Obari Ocean, sapping the life from unsuspecting marine animals as well as unwary fisherfolk and small seaside settlements. A steaming scourge possesses additional Hit Dice and the heat universal monster ability, and emits so much energy that any water in a 10-foot-radius spread around it begins to boil, dealing 1d6 points of damage to creatures that begin their turn submerged in it.</Description>

    <Description>This nasty water-dwelling creature is a particular bane to fisherfolk in tropical seas, occasionally getting caught up in their nets and striking angrily at unwary sailors as they spill their catch out onto the deck. The sea snake tends to follow schools of fish and pick off stragglers, choosing to hunt smaller prey instead of larger foes and only attacking more formidable enemies if it feels threatened. A sea snake's anatomy is particularly well adapted to its environment, and its single lung takes up its entire length. The average sea snake is 4 feet long from tail to head and weighs 10 pounds.</Description>

    <Description>The giant sea snake is one of the biggest reasons many sailors of the Shackles have a downright visceral and phobic response to the thought of falling overboard. These patient predators are known to follow sailing ships, swimming just below the surface of the water while they wait for the opportunity to strike at any unfortunate crew members who might fall over the side. Particularly hungry giant sea snakes have been known to climb the side of a vessel and snatch unwary sailors right from the deck. Giant sea snakes typically reach up to 30 feet in length and weigh 500 pounds.</Description>

    <Description>For the vast majority of ships, the shackled sorcerer provides the main artillery in skirmishes, sending sheets of flame at enemy vessels or targeting burly, hostile sailors with blasts of arcane might from the rear of a boarding party. Most buccaneers give their sorcerers a wide berth, knowing their destructive power, and thus sorcerers sometimes find themselves ostracized from the rest of their crewmates, misunderstood by their less gifted and more superstitious compatriots. In battle, however, pirates do all they can to protect their magic-wielding allies from harm, knowing that their powers can mean the difference between victory and swinging from a gibbet. The majority of shackled sorcerers are considered officers, but they rarely assume traditional positions of authority such as a captain's first mate. Instead, they are considered advisers as well as weapons, and powers such as the ability to locate treasure or change the direction of the winds are highly prized among sea-faring magic-wielders. While the bloodlines of shackled sorcerers are often connected in some way with life at sea-including the Aquatic or Stormborn bloodlines-any gifted arcane casters who can hurl destruction are welcomed aboard most ships.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Detonate (Su) As a standard action, a soucouyant in her fiery form can choose to explode in a 30-foot-radius burst of fire that deals 8d6 points of damage (DC 19 Reflex save for half damage) to all creatures in the area. Using this ability returns a soucouyant to her humanoid form. Fiery Form (Su) As a standard action, a soucouyant who has removed her skin can assume the form of a flying ball of fire similar to that created by a flaming sphere spell (CL 8th) for up to 8 rounds. Upon returning to humanoid form, a soucouyant must wait 1d4 rounds before she can assume fiery form again. A soucouyant who enters the same space as a creature stops moving for that round and deals 3d6 points of fire damage to the creature unless it succeeds at a DC 18 Reflex save. A soucouyant in fiery form retains her usual AC, but is immune to nonmagical attacks and effects. A successful targeted dispel magic spell or dealing 20 points of cold damage to a soucouyant in fiery form forces her to return to her humanoid form. A soucouyant can assume fiery form a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier (6 for most soucouyants). The save DC is Charisma-based. Mask Evil (Su) During the day, a soucouyant has the appearance of an old woman, an illusion created by an effect like alter self; at night the illusion fades, revealing her monstrous nature. While she is "wearing" her skin, a soucouyant's evil nature is masked as though by a constant undetectable alignment spell.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Soucouyants are insidious monsters also known as blood crones. They prefer to live near small humanoid societies, assuming the appearance of a wizened old woman. It is only at night that she assumes her true form, when her wrinkled skin peels back and reveals the monstrosity that lurks within, which seeks the blood of those sleeping, unsuspecting neighbors who know her merely as the eccentric widow living at the edge of town. Soucouyants prefer to capture victims for their cruel experiments when possible, and drain such unfortunates of their blood over a course of days or even weeks to sate their sanguinary appetites. A typical soucouyant is 6 feet tall and weighs 120 pounds. The most powerful soucouyants take it upon themselves to further their spellcasting abilities, and usually possess levels as witches.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Aerial Attack (Ex) A canopy creeper gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls when battling a creature that is not touching the ground or otherwise braced on a solid surface (such as a ship's deck). This bonus applies on combat maneuver checks and to CMD. Camouflage (Ex) Because a canopy creeper blends in with the foliage that is its natural habitat, a DC 20 Perception check (modified for distance) is required to notice it before it attacks for the first time. Any creature with ranks in Survival or Knowledge (nature) can use either of those skills (also modified for distance) instead of Perception to notice the plant. Feed (Ex) When a canopy creeper grapples a creature with its tendrils, it begins to drain the creature's bodily fluids through the target's pores or other body orifices with its tendrils. This feeding deals 1d8 points of damage and 1 point of Strength damage to the target. If the vine tendril is severed or the target breaks the grapple, this feeding ceases until a new grapple is established. Vine Tendrils (Ex) A canopy creeper can take control of any network of vines it has attached itself to and use up to four of those vines as weapons to strike out at targets up to 100 feet away. The vine tendrils have 10 hit points, DR 5/slashing, and a Break DC of 21. If one of these vines is destroyed, the canopy creeper can assume control of another vine as a move action to bring it to bear in combat.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>A little-known menace of the jungles and forests of uncharted southern Garund, the canopy creeper is a semi-sentient plant that blends in with the foliage of the forest canopy and makes use of the flora's own outgrowth to trap and feed upon its prey. The canopy creeper resembles a mass of thickly knotted and twisted jungle vines that correspond to the colors and varieties of its native habitat. It has a larger knot of this tangle at its center mass, which also conceals a large, beaklike maw. The canopy creeper can spread itself over a broad area to resemble little more than this network of vines, or it can draw itself up into a large, coiled mass with its beak exposed. The actual vines that coil together to form the canopy creeper are hundreds of feet long altogether in an adult specimen. When spread out, these tangles of vine cover an area 20 feet in diameter. They congregate into a mass approximately 10 feet in diameter when drawn in together. The mass of a canopy creeper weighs about 3,000 pounds in total. A canopy creeper can live for hundreds of years in a hospitable climate if sufficient sunlight and food sources are available. Ecology Canopy creepers are plants naturally evolved to take advantage of their surroundings. They grow amid the lush foliage of jungles or rain forests where a diverse array of vine plants proliferates. The canopy creeper climbs up among the tree tops and intertwines its own vine-grown body with those that grow naturally, enabling it to gain control over the naturally occurring network of vines to use as a source of both defense and sustenance. While a canopy creeper does gain food and energy from photosynthesis, it cannot maintain its active metabolism when relying only on the nutrients gleaned from sun and rain. For maximum efficiency, it uses the vine tendrils that it gains control of to detect by scent, to entrap, and to draw prey toward itself. It is also able to use these vine tendrils to procure food as they draw the nutrient-rich fluids from creatures entangled within their embrace, which are then conveyed back to the controlling canopy creeper. While the canopy creeper's primary method of attack is through its vine tendrils, it does have a large beak mouth composed of a hard, hornlike material. This beak is normally concealed within the center of its vine mass, but when creatures approach that prove able to resist its vine tendril attacks, the canopy creeper tries to draw them in close enough so that it can attack with its beak as well. It can consume prey with this mouth, but this is not its preferred method of feeding as most of the prey's fluids are lost as the beak tears the creature apart, resulting in fewer nutrients than if it were to feed solely through the vine tendrils. A canopy creeper naturally mimics the appearance and growth of the types of vines that grow in its environment, so when one is concealed among the vine-tangled foliage above, it is difficult for even an experienced outdoorsman to detect. This is further exacerbated by the fact that it is usually hanging about 100 feet above the ground, making its appearance even more difficult to discern. Canopy creepers' preferred prey is Medium or larger creatures since these tend to hold more of the nutrient-rich fluids that the creepers feed upon; meanwhile, Small and smaller creatures-such as small monkeys-can often be seen cavorting around and even suspended from a canopy creeper, oblivious to its presence. However, during starvation conditions when the creeper is forced to rely upon photosynthesis for its survival, it readily preys upon such smaller creatures as well. The result of this preference, however, is that the canopy creature typically focuses its attacks on opponents of at least Medium size. Canopy creepers store a great deal of moisture from their normally wet habitat in their vine structures, making them difficult to burn. However, this fact, as well as their adaptation to warm climates, makes them particularly susceptible to cold attacks, which cause them to become brittle and prone to fractures in their vine structures. Habitat &amp; Society A canopy creeper out of its habitat is a canopy creeper in serious trouble. The creature relies on the prolific presence of other vine growths to camouf lage its presence and to provide an aerial habitat from which it can feed safely above most creatures that might prey upon it. As a result, if a canopy creeper is caught on the ground away from screening foliage, it flies into a berserk frenzy, lashing out with its beak as it attempts to make for the nearest tree or high ground to escape. A well-fed canopy creeper buds once every 4 or 5 years and drops dozens of small seedlings to the ground. Most of these shrivel up and die from lack of sustenance, but one or two usually manage to survive on rats and other vermin until they grow large and strong enough to become mobile, a process that usually takes about a month. These seedlings then instinctively begin looking for a new hunting area away from their parents and siblings, since the plants are naturally solitary and avoid encroaching on each other's hunting territory. A successful seedling reaches full size in 2-3 years if it finds a location with suitable prey to feed upon. During the time when the plants are seedlings, opportunistic horticulturists have been known to contain and transport canopy creepers, transplanting them elsewhere and raising them as potent guardian plant creatures.</Description>

Quills (Ex) Any creature attacking a giant blowfish with light or one-handed melee weapons, natural weapons, or an unarmed strike takes 1d8 points of piercing damage. A creature that grapples a giant blowfish takes 2d6 points of piercing damage each round it does so. Creatures damaged by a giant blowfish's quills must also save or be poisoned. These gigantic cousins of common blowfish, covered in poisonous spearlike quills, can reach up to 10 feet in size, and nearly double that when fully inf lated.</SpecialAbilities>

    <Description>The unpredictability and viciousness of the sahuagin race isn't just an aspect of their sharklike temperament- it seems to be inherent in their very beings. The unusual and typically deadly mutants common to the race attest to this, their forms altering and becoming more deadly based either on the needs of the community or ambiguous environmental factors. Whatever the case, sahuagin mutants often rise to positions of respect and inf luence in sahuagin communities, their innate advantages instantly placing them among their people's rulers. Of these mutants, four-armed sahuagin brutes and malenti- sahuagin with the appearances of sea elves-arise most commonly, though these are in no way the only sahuagin mutants known to the savage seas. Sahuagin Alterations Both the four-armed sahuagin and the malenti use the stats presented on page 239 of the Bestiary as their foundations, with the following alterations. As sahuagin are such common menaces over the course of the Skull &amp; Shackles Adventure Path, their variants are included here to make encounters with the shark people even more unpredictable and deadly. Four-Armed Sahuagin: These mutants gain Multiattack and Toughness as bonus feats and the multiweapon mastery ability. These changes do not include an increase in such a mutant's Hit Dice, but do increase its CR to 3. Despite the advantages these additions give the creature, its hit points are on the low side for a CR 3 monster. GMs should consider giving four-armed sahuagin armor considerably better than that usually worn by CR 3 monsters to make up for this relative glass jaw. Giving the creature leather armor (or an aquatic equivalent, such as shark leather armor) grants it a +2 armor bonus, increasing its AC to 18-above the average for its CR, but a considered benefit to help balance out its weakness. Four-armed sahuagin excel as barbarians, fighters, rangers, and warriors. Malenti: These mutants gain a +4 bonus to Dexterity and Charisma, Deceitful and Skill Focus (Bluff ) as bonus feats, and command as a spell-like ability (representing increased telepathic inf luence over aquatic creatures). Additionally, a malenti's natural armor bonus decreases to +2 and the malenti loses its light blindness and natural weapons. The benefits a malenti gains largely offset those it loses, resulting in no change to the creature's CR. Malenti excel as bards, oracles, rogues, and wizards. Other Sahuagin Mutants Although four-armed sahuagin and malenti are the most common sahuagin mutants, they are not the only abnormalities to arise from sahuagin stock. The following mutants are also sometimes found in sahuagin societies. While rarer than other mutants, they too quickly garner the respect and fear of their piscine brethren. Prehistoric Sahuagin: Also known as adacthys, these sahuagin mutants are throwbacks to some even more savage epoch; they are Large, have a +7 natural armor bonus, and can speak with aquatic dinosaurs and megafauna in addition to sharks. They are usually found in the same waters as prehistoric creatures or waters that are somehow strangely affected by the flow of time. Shark-Blooded Sahuagin: These sahuagin mutants have overly large maws filled with rows of sharklike teeth, and the fins and tail of an oversized thresher shark (or other local variety). These abnormalities give them the appearance of monstrous merfolk, a swim speed of 80 feet, and a bite attack that deals 1d6 points of damage. Shark-blooded sahuagin are most typically found in sahuagin communities with unusually high numbers of shark guardians and near shark breeding grounds. Spined Sahuagin: Covered in hundreds of needle-like spines, these sahuagin can raise these piercing protrusions to impale creatures that attempt to grab or consume them. Any creature that grapples a spined sahuagin takes 1d4 points of piercing damage. Additionally, these mutants gain Defensive Combat Training as a bonus feat. Spined sahuagin most commonly appear in depths that also serve as the hunting grounds of sea serpents, thalassic behemoths, or other massive aquatic predators.</Description>

    <Description_Visual>This fierce creature has the forebody of a great cat, with two powerful, clawed legs under a threatening mouth of sharp claws. Colorful fins cover its back and torso, leading to a sleek tail, like that of a great fish.</Description_Visual>
    <Source>AP 56</Source>
    <IsTemplate>0</IsTemplate>
    <Description>The feral sea cat (sometimes referred to as the sea lion, sea tiger, or sea leopard) is among the most vicious and ubiquitous of coastal predators in the world's tropical oceans. The upper body of a sea cat is that of a typical large cat-be it a lion, tiger, leopard, or cheetah- complete with a pair of clawed paws capable of rending the flesh from its prey. In place of back legs, however, the sea cat has a sleek and powerful tail that allows it to move quickly and silently through the water. While only the back half of a sea cat looks fishlike, its entire body from the neck down is covered in fine scales and fins, making it a formidable swimmer. Among individual sea cats, these scales vary greatly in color and pattern, often inf luenced by the primary habitat of a given specimen; most sea cats, however, have bright coloration in striped or spotted patterns. The typical sea cat is 12 feet long and weighs upward of 800 pounds. Ecology Unlike many aquatic animals, sea cats can survive in both fresh and salt water and in any subarctic climate, though they prefer warm seas to temperate lakes or rivers. Sea cats rely on speed and ferocity in the hunt, and are thus not built to withstand extreme cold, as they lacks fur or fat to insulate them in frigid waters. Most sea cats live in the ocean, where the diversity of life allows for a varied and consistent supply of food, though prides of sea cats and particularly adventurous individuals of the species have been known to follow prey into river deltas and beyond to inland lakes if pickings become slim in the sea. A sea cat's diet consists of small fish, crustaceans, and aquatic mammals such as seals and otters, but the creature's overpowering predatory and territorial instincts often lead it to attack ocean birds, humanoids, and even other aquatic predators such as sharks and crocodiles. Coastal fishermen in areas where sea cats are known to dwell vigilantly look out for the predators, because the beasts have learned that netted or hooked prey is easier to kill and steal from the line, using less energy. As if the theft of a hard-earned catch weren't enough to keep anglers on guard, a sea cat that finds itself unsated by a net of fish or a trapped crab will often turn its sights on the other end of the fishing line and attack the very fisherman who helped it gain its meal. When not hunting, sea cats can be found on coastal rocks, coral islands, or even isolated beaches sunning themselves and digesting their most recent meals. When in a state of rest, sea cats are typically less alert and more vulnerable, and thus often lounge in pairs or larger groups so that one can act as lookout. This is especially true of mothers rearing cubs, which have been known to stay awake for as long as a week straight to allow their young rest in their most vulnerable time of life. Sea cats are ferocious hunters and when taken by the primal urge to fight, do so to the death, with little regard for anything but their prey. Whether hunting or protecting its territory, a sea cat generally attacks immediately upon discovering a target, even when faced with a much larger or more dangerous foe. A sea cat uses its claws and bite frantically, only ceasing its assault when the target is dead. If faced with multiple opponents, a sea cat attacks the nearest target and single-mindedly fights until that creature is dead. Pairs or prides of sea cats use pack tactics when hunting or defending their territories, wearing opponents down until a single beast can dispatch it, often allowing those of the larger group to escape while the entire pack focuses on a single target. A sea cat's physical characteristics are as much a product of the animal's environment as they are a result of genetics, and a sea cat's coloration often directly mimics its habitat. Sea cats living among colorful coral or particularly vibrant vegetation are often marked with spots and stripes of vivid red, orange, violet, and yellow, while those specimens on rocky or sandy beaches take on more earthy tones and mottled patterns. Habitat &amp; Society Sea cats are born in litters of between one and six cubs, and mothers raise their young in isolation from the rest of a pride until the young are between 6 and 9 months in age. During this time, the mother teaches the young to hunt, mark their territory, and defend themselves against intruders. When a litter of sea cats reaches maturity, their sea cat mother simply abandons them and returns to her pride, leaving the young to fend for themselves. Some young find their way back to the pride and are quickly assimilated into the group, while others form new prides centered around the location where their mothers abandoned them. A pride typically consists of a single male (called a bull) and as many as a dozen mature females who do a majority of the hunting and defending of the territory. Males without a pride of their own remain solitary hunters and are called stags. Each year, at mating season, stags approach a pride's territory and attempt to lure females away from the rest of the group as the females keep vigil over the pride's territory. When a male has a single female isolated, the two battle with all the ferocity of their species. Whichever sea cat has the upper hand relents in the last moment before killing its foe as a sign of acceptance of the mating offer, and if the other sea cat remains peaceful and does not use the moment of hesitation as an opportunity for counterstrike, the courtship dance is considered a success. Occasionally, a particularly willful stag encroaches on a bull's territory in an attempt to wrest his pride from him. In these cases, all females abandon the males to their duel, returning the following day and taking up loyalty to whichever male remains alive. The typical pride changes leaders once or twice a year, while more volatile prides see a change in leadership as often as five or six times annually. A sea cat's territory generally extends between 2 and 5 miles from its den, though most sea cats patrol only as far as a mile or two from the shore. Since a sea cat can't breathe water and must come up for air, only the bravest or most foolhardy sea cats venture farther than 2 miles from land, meaning a creature wishing to bypass a sea cat's territory can often go around it by traveling farther out to sea than the cat itself is willing to swim to protect its realm. A sea cat releases a powerful pheromone into the water to mark the boundaries of its territory, and thus must trace the borders every day or two in order to maintain them, as the constant flow of water dilutes the scent to the point of ineffectuality within 4 days depending on the strength of currents and tidal and weather conditions. The sea cat's generally low intelligence and high level of ferocity makes it incredibly difficult to train or domesticate, but merfolk, aquatic elves, locathahs, and even surface-dwelling pirates and sailors have occasionally been known to take a cub and raise it as a pet. Whether these are simply legends meant to frighten away potential enemies or true accounts of taming a sea cat are not widely known, but the sea cat's natural territorial instincts make it a formidable guardian if properly trained. Additionally, some pirate ports are known for capturing sea cats and pitting them against one another for sport.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Curse (Su) Instead of poison, the spines of black spots bear what is for some a minor annoyance, but for sailors nearly a death sentence. The save DC is Charisma-based. Spines-injury; save Fort DC 13; onset 1 round; frequency constant; effect target takes a -10 penalty on Swim checks and cannot hold its breath. If forced underwater, the target must save each round (Core Rulebook 445) or drown. Leaping Charge (Ex) A black spot ignores rough terrain and gaps less than 10 feet wide when charging. Additionally, its charges do no provoke attacks of opportunity. Spines (Ex) A black spot's spines can swivel to face any approaching creature. Any creature that attacks a black spot urchin with an unarmed strike or a natural attack is automatically attacked by the black spot's spines as an immediate action. If the spines hit, they can curse the target as well. Stability (Ex) All giant urchins and similar creatures-like black spots-receive a +8 bonus to CMD when resisting a bull rush or trip attempt.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Though not actually intelligent, black spots are terrifyingly adept at locating prey and potential threats, leaping forth from tide pools in great bounds to skewer their victims. However, the true danger of a black spot urchin comes not from its gnashing, star-shaped beak or its needle-pointed spines, but rather from its weird magical nature. Instead of simply poisoning those it punctures, a black spot urchin in fact curses them, inhibiting their ability to swim. How exactly black spots came by such a strange ability and what they gain from drowning their victims days or even years after first encountering them are anyone's guess, but sailors stung by one of the beasts often refuse to go to sea again for fear of their lives. A black spot urchin is typically several feet in diameter, but is mostly made of its long spines and so weighs only a few pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Jet (Ex) While underwater, a ravenous urchin swarm can jet as a full-round action at a speed of 70 feet. It must move in a straight line, but does not provoke attacks of opportunity while jetting. Poison (Ex) Swarm-injury; save Fort DC 12; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Dex and reduce movement speed by 10 feet (to a minimum of 5 feet); cure 1 save. The venom of ravenous urchin swarms stiffens muscles and locks joints into painful configurations. The save DC is Constitution-based. Underfoot (Ex) Each time a creature moves through a space occupied by a ravenous urchin swarm or starts its movement in such a space, it runs the risk of a ravenous urchin moving underfoot. The creature must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex save or take 1 point of damage plus poison. Additionally, the affected creature's movement speed is reduced by half because its foot is wounded. This movement penalty lasts for 24 hours, until the creature is successfully treated with a DC 15 Heal check, or until it receives at least 1 point of magical healing. A charging or running creature must immediately stop if it steps on a ravenous urchin. Any creature moving at half its speed or slower can pick its way through a tidal pool of ravenous urchins (but not a ravenous urchin swarm) with no trouble. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Unlike most urchins, the creatures that make up the infamous urchin swarms are capable of propelling themselves beneath the waves at furious speeds, creating a dangerous threat to pearl divers and other aquatic creatures-often one that's dismissed as a myth until it's far too late.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Poison (Ex) Spines-injury; save Fort DC 18; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Con and stunned for 1 round; cure 1 save. Great diadem urchin venom is shockingly painful and feels acidic at the moment of contact-though the worst of the pain fades after a moment. The save DC is Constitution-based. Spines (Ex) A great diadem urchin's spines can swivel to face any approaching creature. Any creature that attacks a great diadem urchin with an unarmed strike or a natural attack, or any Large or smaller creature that attacks with a one-handed weapon or light weapon, is automatically attacked by the hunter urchin's spines as an immediate action. If the spines hit, they can poison the target as well.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Enormous and brilliantly colored diadem urchins are often sought after by terrestrial collectors or aquatic creatures seeking to simultaneously decorate and defend their throne rooms, yet such beasts are never truly trainable, and attack anyone who comes close.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Corrosive Strikes (Ex) When a tiberolith becomes heavily damaged, the caustic fluid that gives it its glow begins to leak, dealing extra damage to creatures it strikes. A tiberolith with 30 hit points or fewer remaining deals an additional 1d6 points of acid damage with each successful slam. Shockwave (Su) Three times per day, as a standard action, a tiberolith can harness the energy powering it and unleash a burst of electricity. This blast deals 12d6 points of electricity damage to all creatures within 30 feet (Reflex DC 16 for half). The save is Constitution-based. Spell Trap (Su) Anytime a tiberolith is targeted by a spell that allows spell resistance, it may attempt to resist that spell as normal. If it fails, the spell still does not affect it, instead becoming trapped within the runes on its body. If another spell is cast upon the tiberolith that overcomes its spell resistance, that spell becomes trapped within its runes and the first spell immediately affects the tiberolith. Any spell caught within a tiberolith's runes dissipates after 24 hours. A tiberolith's runes can only trap one spell at any given time.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Eerie animate ruins thought by many to be remnants of the long-vanished Ghol-Gan civilization, tiberoliths were created to protect their vicious masters' villages and citadels. Found among isolated or submerged ruins, these ancient defenders are hewn from great slabs of stone and held together with mysterious, sinewy materials that sometimes look frighteningly like human flesh. Even more sinister, though, is the mysterious technology imbued within these terrifying sentinels. When disturbed, tiberoliths transform from monolithic watchers to glowing avengers, wreaking destruction on all in their paths. Because of their painstaking fabrication process, no two tiberoliths look exactly alike. Each individual's body is covered in a unique pattern of markings-often depicting horrific, cannibalistic rituals-that blaze azure when the guard activates. Genderless, bare-fisted warriors, the creatures often display features meant to further strike fear into the hearts of intruders, such as enormous tusks, a lion-shaped head, or a crown of spears. With fists the size of boulders, tiberoliths typically stand 18 feet tall and weigh 7,000 pounds. Ecology Nearly as old as the land and seas themselves, tiberoliths have been the subject of countless native myths. Some insist that in fervent devotion to their dark religion, the Ghol-Gan created tiberoliths as playthings for their gods. Others claim the ancient people sacrificed entire villages of souls to a powerful, bloodthirsty deity in exchange for the tiberoliths' protective technology. Most scholars, however, believe the Ghol-Gan spent centuries building tiberoliths to serve as the guardians of their most treasured assets. It still remains unclear, however, why these mighty defenders have survived while their creators did not. Though quite rare, tiberoliths have been the focus of much obsession among those few who know of their existence, primarily because of the enigmas that continue to surround them. Some who live near one of the ancient colossi believe the blue fluid flowing within an activated tiberolith acts as a panacea, or is otherwise a magical agent. However, those seekers lucky enough to have defeated one of the guardians invariably find themselves disappointed. Far from mystical, the fluid exhibits no magic whatsoever, and is as caustic as any acid, burning through flesh as easily as through fabric. Given the combination of both acid and electricity inside the tiberoliths, some alchemists have posited that the tiberoliths are powered by enormous techno-magical batteries. Perhaps more terrifying is the thought that the tiberoliths might actually be batteries, meant to be gathered together for some great magical undertaking, in which case the greatest treasure a tiberolith guards may be the tiberolith itself. For some industrious adventurers, especially those of an arcane or alchemical bent, a tiberolith represents an opportunity to cultivate a powerful, forgotten technology-yet such experimentation rarely succeeds, more often resulting in the pulverized or acid-eaten corpse of the would-be scholar. While tiberoliths' limbs all bear hollows securing puzzlebox-like devices, modern scholars have yet to determine the exact nature of the apparatuses, and how they relate to the constructs' operation. Based on reports of tiberoliths' unpredictability in battle, both historical and recent, it seems the Ghol-Gan never quite perfected the technology, either. Over the years, adventurers traversing former Ghol-Gan strongholds have recorded numerous sightings of these rare creations. Tiberoliths do not patrol their homelands, however. When undisturbed, they resemble frightful statues resting in ruined cities, standing outside crumbling ziggurats, or breaking the canopy of thick jungles. It's only when uninvited humanoids venture past that these hulking statues come to life, oblivious to the fact that those they once served have long since vanished from this world. Habitat &amp; Society Tiberoliths are typically found alone among Ghol-Gan ruins, particularly those located in the Isles of the Shackles. It's said tiberoliths are most numerous on islands such as the horrifying Cannibal Isles, the eerie Devil's Arches, the haunted Yoha's Graveyard, and the intrepid Ushinawa Isles, despite the efforts of the latter's samurai inhabitants to eradicate the behemoths. On rare occasions, tiberoliths are found slumbering in squads of three or four, usually positioned to protect the ruined entrances of their lost creators' most sacred structures. Whether alone or in groups, many tiberoliths have been inactive so long they've become obscured by overgrowth or claimed by rising sea levels. They might nearly blend in with the environment, but the sound tiberoliths make when activated-a high-pitched whirring not unlike the shriek of an eagle-is unmistakable. Although tiberoliths are generally considered unintelligent servants of their vanished masters, an ancient legend speaks of an uncharted island in the Shackles where tiberoliths appear to have gained some measure of sentience. This tale states that, within the hollow of an inactive volcano, a terrifying number of whirring tiberoliths go through the motions of the most heinous Ghol-Gan rituals in a ghostly tribute to their lost masters. However, because of the story's dubious origins- and the sheer unlikeliness of its claims- most people regard this as little more than a fireside tale. Construction A tiberolith is created from three to four slabs of naturally occurring stone such as limestone, typically weighing 2,000 to 2,500 pounds each. These slabs must be bound with vegetative- or sinew-based lashing materials treated with rare unguents costing at least 7,000 gp. The processes by which tiberoliths are created are exceptionally rare, and most of the secrets to doing so were lost with the fall of Ghol-Gan. Certain explorers, scholars, and magic-users from the Shackles might possess these secrets and be willing to share them, but they could cost upward of 10,000 gp. Tiberolith CL 12th; Price 48,000 CONSTRUCTION Requirements Craft Construct, acid fog, limited wish, stone shape, creator must be at least caster level 11th; Skill Craft (sculptures) or Craft (stonemasonry) DC 18; Cost 24,000 gp</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Cytillesh Flash (Su) Once per day, a cytillipede can cause the cytillesh patches that grow along its body to release a bright flash of blue light that provides bright light in a 20- foot radius and dim light in a 40-foot radius. All creatures within the area of effect must succeed at a DC 22 Will save. Those within the area of bright light are stunned for 1d4 rounds. Creatures within the area of dim light are confused for 1d2 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus. Cytillipede Poison (Ex) Bite- injury; save Fort DC 20; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3 Dex and dazed; cure 1 save. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Derros have long used other creatures in their experiments with alchemical and magical augmentations. For the most part, these experiments are not altogether failures, though they don't usually have the results the derros had in mind. However, on rare occasions they actually get it right. The cytillipede is one of those rare occasions. For years, they adapted the diet of a species of giant centipede to eat nothing but cytillesh fungus. After years of exposure to the fungus and certain magical augmentations, the result was an entirely new breed of giant centipedes that the derros named cytillipedes. A cytillipede has a gray segmented body of hard chitin. Patches of cytillesh fungus grow along its back, which gives the creature an eerie blue glow. Because of its constant glowing, a cytillipede out in the open is fairly easy to spot. Most of the time, a cytillipede is encountered in the company of derro patrols that use their creations as mounts or to guard their lairs. In combat, a cytillipede simply rushes at its opponent and makes bite attacks, relying on its cytillesh venom to stun its enemies so it can bite them repeatedly while they deal with the disorientation of sudden short-term memory loss. A cytillipede normally only uses its cytillesh flash ability when it has been seriously wounded or threatened by multiple opponents. A trained cytillipede may also be commanded to use this ability by its rider. Because of their long exposure to cytillesh, derros are unaffected by the cytillesh-based attacks of cytillipedes. Cytillipedes are usually encountered as part of a derro patrol around a derro lair. A typical cytillipede is a little over 10 feet long and 3-1/2 feet high, and weighs about 600 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Powerful Jaws (Ex) The teeth of the angustiden are so sharp and tough that they make light work of almost any material. When the angustiden makes a successful grapple attempt following the use of its grab ability, it automatically makes a sunder attempt against the armor worn by the creature grappled as a free action. Each round the grapple is maintained it makes another sunder attempt against its victim's armor.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The angustiden is a gargantuan hunter of the deep sea. The size and ferocity of this behemoth are matched only by those of the megalodon, and it counts even the great white shark among its prey. Its foot-long, dense, and jagged teeth tear through anything they choose to clamp down on, and very few creatures manage to leave such an embrace with all of their body parts.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Whorled Jaw (Ex) When a helicoprion hits a Medium or smaller creature with its bite it can, as a free action, attempt to grapple and then pin that creature should the initial grapple be successful. Once the target is pinned, the helicoprion continues to do its bite damage (including bleed) for as long as it maintains the pin.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The helicoprion is a bizarre beast to behold. The remarkable physiology of its mouth allows it to flick out its bottom jaw, unrolling the whorl of teeth and snaring prey along its length. As its powerful muscles roll its jaw, the prey becomes trapped in a spiral of ragged, brutal incisors. Once it has captured a hearty meal, the helicoprion retreats in a thickening cloud of its victim's blood to patiently await the slowing of struggles and the imminent demise of its dinner.</Description>

    <Description>A ship in a bottle signifies patience and devotion. Parts are assembled through an obstinate hole to create the illusion of something impossible. The average model maker devotes months of delicate handling and blinding eyestrain to its creation. Most ships in bottles are built by sea captains and modeled after their vessels. As the devotion of a captain to his ship compares to that of a marriage, a ship in a bottle could be seen as the offspring of that relationship. This devotion is palpable well beyond the Material Plane. Water sprites, tiny elemental spirits from the Plane of Water, see boats as perversions enabling landlubbers' insistence on venturing where they do not belong. These water spirits commandeer ships in bottles and sail them through the air to chase off the sailors who invade the high seas. Even if the ship in a bottle is destroyed, the water spirit at the helm claims victory, having effectively forced a captain to destroy his offspring. A ship in a bottle is about 1 foot long and weighs about 5 pounds. Ecology Model ships in bottles stand prominently on shelves in the quarters of captains and admirals, usually made to perfectly replicate their creators' ships. Once brought to life by a water spirit, a ship in a bottle maneuvers through the air on waves of mist. The strings of its miniature ballistae winch with enough tension to fire, and the water spirit turns a tribute into something that is both a weapon and a parody at once. Not all ships in bottles are captained willingly. Captains or admirals who desire more dramatic tributes to the ships they have commanded sometimes have mundane ships in bottles seemingly brought to life via magic. Through either great devotion or greater gold, they gain access to the magic necessary to bind water spirits to their model ships. The magic binding a water spirit to a ship in a bottle also enchants the elemental spirit into believing it is the captain and crew of a typical vessel. Magically bound water spirits follow the orders of either the caster who bound them or the maker of the ship in a bottle, treating him or her as their admiral. Habitat &amp; Society A ship in a bottle's life is on the high seas, and its water spirit captain sets sail toward the nearest body of water. Its mission is to seek and destroy land creatures on the seas, and tales of ships in bottles' voyages rarely speak of glory. When a ship in a bottle manages to survive long enough to log journeys, what can be extrapolated from its miniscule logbook makes for fascinating insight into the elemental mind. The ways in which the water spirit captain justifies the world as seen from its viewpoint reads like a mix of mythology and a child's bathtime story. The spirit inhabiting this construct determines the nature of the crew and replicates tiny sailors on deck. These are solely to unnerve onlookers, as the spirit operates the ship in a bottle's sails and weaponry hydraulically. A water spirit magically bound to a ship in a bottle agains its will often crews the vessel with manifested sailors based on the bottle's owner, or his descriptions of the original ship's crew. A ship in a bottle sails alone only when it has no other choice, and usually welcomes the opportunity to join, form, or lead a fleet with other water spirits, flying tiny flags designed seemingly at random. Usually unbound water spirits captain all the ships in a bottled armada, although sometimes an unbound water spirit takes advantage of naive bound water spirits. A chance meeting between individual ships in bottles is not the only manner in which fleets form. Water spirits sometimes conspire to commandeer multiple ships in bottles together, and nautical museums have reported dozens of ships in bottles flying off shelves and out to sea. Construction A ship in a bottle can be created through a binding ritual undertaken by a powerful spellcaster. The ritual requires a masterwork model ship in a bottle that must be built from materials worth 100 gp, and DC 30 Craft (woodworking) skill checks made over 2 consecutive weeks. Alternatively, a masterwork model ship in a bottle can instead be purchased for the ritual, but it must be worth at least 600 gp. Ship in a Bottle CL 9th; Price 5,100 gp (5,600 gp) CONSTRUCTION Requirements Craft Construct, animate object, magic jar, suitable spirit of a living creature, 2 ranks in Craft (woodworking); Cost 2,600 gp (3,100 gp)</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Salted Wound (Su) Any living creature damaged by a ship sentinel must make a successful DC 16 Fortitude save or take a -1 penalty on attack and damage rolls for 1 round as salty brine drips painfully onto the wound. On a successful critical hit, the target takes an additional 3d6 points of damage as its flesh cracks and withers from dehydration. The save DC is Charisma-based. Ship Sight (Su) A ship sentinel is treated as having tremorsense out to 100 feet while onboard a ship, as its senses permeate the vessel's timbers. It can only detect creatures in contact with the vessel or on objects in contact with the vessel. It cannot use this ability to detect creatures not in contact with the ship, even if they are within the ability's 100-foot radius.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Ship sentinels are animated constructs that are bound to a specific vessel and to that ship's captain. Crafted to resemble a humanoid figurehead, a ship sentinel normally rests at the prow of its ship, granting good fortune and protection to the crew. But in times of dire need, the captain can also activate the ship sentinel, causing it to spring to life and fight alongside the vessel's crew. Although individual features of ship sentinels may vary, all ship sentinels are made of wood and have the same general statistics. A ship sentinel stands roughly 6 feet tall and weighs 400 pounds. Ecology A ship sentinel's form is carved and shaped by skilled woodworkers, but cannot truly be brought to "life" without offerings from the sea. Most spellcasters who endeavor to create these guardians crush a mixture of sand, shells, and valuable pearls and mix it with saltwater and oils, creating a grainy varnish. The carved figure is coated with the solution and then brought to the shores of the sea and affixed to the bowsprit of the craft it will protect. Only then is the construct's creation finally complete. Unlike with most constructs, however, control of the creature does not fall to the creator, but rather to the captain of the ship to which it is affixed. If the captain of the ship changes, control of the construct passes to the new captain. Although resistant to most hazards of sea and storm, all ship sentinels eventually wear down after a time and require polishing, cleaning, and recoating with the specially prepared varnish used during the construct's creation. If maintained in this fashion, however, a single ship sentinel can guard a ship-passing from captain to captain-for decades or even centuries. Habitat &amp; Society Ship sentinels are solitary creations, and a single construct is capable of defending even the largest of ships. Their presence is an undisputed boon to all aboard-though most captains prefer not to speak of their crafts' guardians, preferring to keep the constructs as secret weapons. When the sentinel is needed, the captain must shout a word or short phrase to bring the construct to life. An awakened ship sentinel is able to recognize loyal members of its crew, placing them under its protective wards, and directs its attacks against any living targets that it does not ward, though the construct's master can point it toward specific targets. In combat, ship sentinels can pulverize flesh and bone with their heavy wooden hands, but normally wield a weapon of some kind-usually a spear, rapier, shortsword, or other light weapon. Stories even exist of elven vessels that armed their ship sentinels with huge bows, or of daring Brevic sea captains who gave their constructs the fabled Aldori dueling swords of their homeland. Regardless of these variations, most weapons used in a ship sentinel's construction draw upon the construct's inherent nimbleness, an agility belied by the figurehead's wooden form. But whether their weapons are forged or natural, all ship sentinels can infuse the sting of seawater and salt air into their blows, wracking their foes with crippling pain. Ship sentinels are resilient foes, their wooden bodies capable of turning aside most attacks that cannot pierce or gouge them. Unfortunately their construction also makes them vulnerable to fire-their greatest weakness-and any magical fire quickly dries a ship sentinel's body to a nearly immobile brittleness. Variant Ship Sentinels Ship sentinels can be crafted in a wide variety of forms and are often embellished and customized similarly to mundane figureheads. The following are some of these constructs' most common customizations. Ballista Marksman: Some ship sentinels have a light ballista built into their forms; these sentinels are usually designed to look like an archer with an oversized bow, a beauteous lillend, or a cruel erinyes. Such ship sentinels rarely have a melee weapon, resorting instead to slams if unable to use their ballistae to make ranged attacks. Statistics for ballista marksmen are modified as follows: Ranged light ballista +12 (3d8 plus salted wound /19-20). See Chapter 3 of Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat for additional details on siege engines. Mariner's Muse: Sculpted to resemble harp-playing angels or armored heralds, a mariner's muse ship sentinel can use the inspire courage effect of a bard's bardic performance once per day for 5 rounds as if it were a 5th-level bard. It always uses all 5 rounds of its performance at the same time and can never use the performance multiple times in 1 day for any duration. Sea Sorcerer: These ship sentinels are often crafted to resemble wizards, sea serpents, or abstract orrery-like sculptures, and possess limited spell-like abilities. They can only use these abilities while onboard a sailing vessel. These spell-like abilities can each be used 3 times per day, and include animate objects, grease, and obscuring mist. Construction A ship sentinel is built from 400 pounds of wood. The creator or a hired artisan must then shape the creature into the desired likeness, usually after a fashion common to the nautical vessels of the region. Afterward, a special varnish is made from a mixture of sand, seawater, crushed pearls and shells, and magically treated oils- the varnish is worth a total of 250 gp and is applied to the entire form. If the creator intends for the ship sentinel to wield a weapon, a masterwork or better version of that weapon must also be supplied. Ship Sentinel CL 9th; Price 21,250 gp; 21,750 gp (ballista marksman); 23,250 gp (mariner's muse); 25,250 gp (sea sorcerer) CONSTRUCTION Requirements Craft Construct, animate object, limited wish, creator must be caster level 9th; Craft (woodworking) check DC 25; Cost 10,750 gp; 11,000 gp (ballista marksman); 11,750 gp (mariner's muse); 12,750 gp (sea sorcerer)</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Channel Energy (Su) The voidstick zombie can channel negative energy as a 15th-level cleric. Sacrilegious Aura (Sp) The overwhelming entropic energies and the sheer number of voidsticks animating the voidstick zombie warp and augment negative and positive energy around the creature. As with all voidsticks, an aura of intense negative energy extends in a 30-foot radius from the zombie functioning as the spell desecrate. Undead within this aura receive a +1 profane bonus on attack and damage rolls and the DC to resist channeled negative energy increases by +3. The voidstick zombie constantly gains the benefits of this effect (the attack and damage bonuses are already incorporated into its statistics). In addition, this miasma of void energies also interferes with wielding positive energy. Any creature attempting to use positive energy in this area-such as through a cleric's channel energy ability, a paladin's lay on hands, or any spell with the healing descriptor-must make a DC 25 concentration check. If this check fails, the effect is blocked, consuming one use of the ability, or the spell is lost.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The voidstick zombie is the hateful creation of wicked shamans and necromancers, who use voidsticks to animate the dead. One voidstick is required for every Hit Die possessed by the base creature. These vile devices, each of which is 6 to 10 inches in length, are pierced through the living or dead body of a creature, pumping the dark energy of the void into its form. Packed with the bitter entropy of negative energy, the creature rises, seeking out the life force of others with endless sadness and insane determination. Its single goal is to extinguish life and smother any source of positive energy. Multiple voidsticks in a creature's form feed one another, augmenting their standard abilities and imbuing the touch of the voidstick zombie with the power to drain life from anything it touches. The zombie becomes almost a sliver of the void itself, existing in a state of such negative power that its very proximity can tamper with other creatures' abilities to summon the powers of the Positive Energy Plane, and with the perpetual sadness that numbs its own intellect it gains the power to enhance and inf luence other creatures that depend on negative energy. These sad creatures, wracked with soulless negative energy, constantly hunger for destruction, delighted at every chance they get to snuff the spark of life from the living. They hunt the islands throughout the Shackles, especially the Cannibal Isles, where their creation began long before its current inhabitants made their home there. As the brutal and savage kuru people of the Cannibal Isles explored the ruins of Ghol-Gan, they discovered the foul magic involved with the voidsticks, and as they turned to barbarism and cannibalism, their shamans carved these devices and created the first voidstick zombie seen on Golarion in thousands of years. The kuru use voidstick zombies for war against each other and to serve as ruthless hunters, culling humanoids who wander too close to their blood-drenched islands. Kuru shamans create the vile voidsticks in order to enhance their own necromantic strength as well as to animate voidstick zombies. In some tribes it is seen as a great honor to be transformed into one of these powerful creatures, and some aged shamans on the eve of their death elect to undergo this transformation instead of becoming a ritual meal for their tribes. Since the rediscovery of voidsticks, those interested in necromancy and the creation of new undead have sent emissaries to the Shackles eager to buy them. These enterprising necromancers experiment with the devices and unleash voidstick zombies into Avistan and Garund to fulfill their murderous intent. Voidsticks In remote parts of the world, it is not always practical for the faithful to visit holy places with any regularity. In particular, the weak, the sick, and the dying may be in no position to trek across plains or risk dangerous water crossings to see their spiritual leaders. In response to this, the godstick was born-a crafted rod that serves as a portable shrine, carried by shamans and witchdoctors and pushed into the ground to focus devotion at any location. Ingenuity is not just the way of the benign, however, and just as often it is the way of evil. Before long, shamans who worshiped more hateful deities corrupted this notion; they created the voidsticks and drove them into bodies, living or dead, charging those bodies with the power of the endless void and creating rattling, hungry abominations. Voidstick Aura faint necromancy [evil]; CL 5 Slot special; Price 2,500 gp, Weighs 1 lb. DESCRIPTION Each voidstick is 6 t0 10 inches long, with a diameter of about an inch. Carved from single pieces of polished darkwood, they often display markings or symbols sacred to the deity of their creator, but can just as easily be plain and smooth. Planting a voidstick into the ground with an appropriate prayer is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. The device floods the area with negative energy, producing an effect identical to the desecrate spell in a 20- foot radius. In addition, any evil divine caster within 20 feet of the voidstick may cast her spells without the need for any material component with a value of 10 gp or less, or any focus item with a value of 50 gp or less. This ability functions only for the individual planting the voidstick and persists until the stick is uprooted. While this is a useful tool for shamans in locations poorly serviced by trade in magical goods, it pales in comparison to the voidstick's most potent function: the creation of undead. Creating a voidstick zombie requires an hour-long ritual during which foul symbols are drawn across a corpse's flesh. At the end of the hour, the creator must make a DC 25 Knowledge (religion) check before driving the first voidstick into the victim's heart. If this check succeeds, the victim is transformed into a voidstick zombie. To fully animate the creature, one voidstick must be used for each Hit Die the base creature has. In 12 rounds, the creature rises under its own power, eager to spread its negative energy and snuff out life nearby. Undead created using voidsticks are not under the control of their creator but can be commanded using channeled negative energy, spells, or similar effects. Voidsticks can also be driven into a living body to slay the creature and transition it to undeath. If a living body is used, the creature must be pinned or otherwise helpless for the duration of the entire ritual. When the ritual is complete and the first voidstick is inserted, the creature must make a DC 18 Fortitude save. If this save succeeds, the creature is reduced to 0 hit points and is dying, but the magic of the voidstick and the ritual are wasted and the ritual must be performed again, using another voidstick. If the save fails, the creature dies and the ritual is successful, transforming the base creature into a voidstick zombie. Undead that contain such an item benefit from the +2 bonus hit points per Hit Die for having been created in the area of an enhanced desecrate spell. CONSTRUCTION Requirements Craft Wondrous Item, animate dead, desecrate; Creator must have 5 ranks in Knowledge (religion). Cost 1,750 gp</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Illuminating Flames (Su) As a standard action, a comozant wyrd may shroud the upper halves of any Small or larger creatures it can see within 30 feet in cold, buzzing flames similar to the wyrd's own. Any degree of electricity resistance blocks this effect, unless the target willingly submits. Otherwise the flames persist until the wyrd is out of range. Because of the flames' glow and buzz, targets of this effect take a -10 penalty on Stealth checks. A comozant wyrd can communicate empathically with creatures subject to this effect, gaining a +4 racial bonus on Sense Motive checks when doing so. Interacting with a wyrd in this way still uses standard social skills and rules. While communicating in this fashion, a comozant wyrd can confer unexpected insight or information equivalent to the result of a divination spell. Lightning Lash (Su) As a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, a comozant wyrd can shock any creature or object within 30 feet to which it has line of effect, dealing 2d8 points of electricity damage. The wyrd can choose for this damage to be nonlethal. If the target is currently affected by the wyrd's illuminating flames, the target is stunned for a round and the flames are dispelled. A creature affected by the combination can resist being stunned with a successful DC 16 Fortitude save. The DC is Charisma-based. Plasma Form (Ex) Although incorporeal, a comozant wyrd cannot hide inside solid objects. It must start its turn attached to the outside of something solid and of Small size or larger, or it takes 5 points of damage. Anyone attacking the wyrd must take a -4 penalty on the attack roll, or resolve the attack against whatever the wyrd is attached to as well.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>A comozant wyrd appears to be approximately 3 feet of heatless blue or violet plasma jutting from solid, protruding objects (usually a mast or spar of a ship). It flickers like flame, and its only static features resemble those of a humanoid face. Manifested on the Material Plane, the creature emits an uncanny buzzing, hissing noise, but does not consume creatures or objects it touches. Creatures adjacent to it or to targets of its illuminating flames often find their hair literally standing on end and their bodies crawling with harmless but unnerving sparks. Ecology Comozant wyrds are most often encountered in the hearts of Golarion's greatest storms, particularly the Eye of Abendego and the smaller storms it spawns. They are incredibly rare, and almost always solitary; no sightings on land have ever been reported. Because they are so rare and their natural environment makes detached study improbable, few creatures on Golarion even know of comozant wyrds, let alone understand their nature. Citing their command of storms, some speculate that the wyrds are infant forms of an unknown breed of storm elementals, but others say they are fey spirits, born in the moment they appear and existing only for the brief time they shine. Habitat &amp; Society Comozant wyrds have no society as such. Seafarers regard them with considerable awe for the danger and mystery that attend them, but few are brave enough to attempt conversation with living plasma on a wooden ship, especially mid-tempest. Displaying such mettle is a sure way to earn considerable respect from any ordinary sailor-persuading a wyrd to abate its storm could inspire outright awe. Comozant wyrds rarely speak even to those fluent in Auran, preferring to communicate in a more primal way, using their illuminating flames. Those who have "conversed" with a wyrd in this way describe an alien mode of communication that is as much raw emotion and image as it is concept and word, and a mysterious mixture of knowledge and ignorance. For instance, when first encountered, a wyrd apparently does not understand how different from itself mortals are, or how dangerous storms are to mortal creatures. Overlying everything is an unsettlingly alien but somehow childlike inquisitiveness, mixed with rage or fear if the wyrd feels threatened. The form this interest takes can vary widely. One report describes spending half an hour in communion with a wyrd, exchanging detailed mental images of elemental and humanoid creatures' anatomies and behaviors while the storm raged unheeded around them. Another speaks of a wyrd chasing the entire crew of a pirate schooner around the deck of the ship with electrical attacks, punishing those who slowed, and stopping only when half the crew was dead. A third author writes of being flooded with comprehension of the nature of the cosmos in a single ecstatic instant, only for the wyrd to banish its own storm and disappear. Such vanishing is a reasonably common occurrence in non-hostile encounters with comozant wyrds. Several accounts agree that once wyrds understand the peril in which storms place mortals, they use their command of the weather to end the storm, even though this apparently forces them to either leave or vanish altogether. To some, this suggests that comozant wyrds possess at least some respect for life, and that what seems like cruelty may simply be uncomprehending curiosity, even playfulness. Naturally, those who have suffered at a wyrd's whim are unsympathetic to this view. One of the few things almost all accounts agree on is that the touch of a comozant wyrd's illuminating flames seems to confer sudden insight. Judging by images glimpsed in wyrds' minds, they appear to know, but not always understand, things that they glimpse in the thoughts, pasts, and entanglements of those with whom they converse. On one occasion, this has led to a traveler learning that one of her companions was in the pay of a hated rival. Other authors recount glimpses of scenes relevant to them that were happening at that precise moment halfway around the world, scenes of which nobody on board could possibly be aware. One way or another, very few of the available reports fail to mention the author glimpsing a secret she could not otherwise learn, an answer-or at least a hint- to a puzzle she had been attempting to solve, or a flash of inspiration that enabled her to complete some great work. These tales lead some desperate souls to seek out storms to sail into, hoping for answers they can find nowhere else. Comozant wyrds themselves do not seem to have a discernible agenda from moment to moment, or indeed to place very much weight on past experience. They will attack-or, conversely, stop fighting and "parley"- without hesitation, based purely on whether they feel their immediate situation warrants it. This is not to say that they forget past behavior, but they seem to bear few grudges. They react badly when they detect deception, however, seemingly regarding it as only a short step down from outright violence.</Description>

    <Description>Perhaps no beasts were trusted into the afterlife so much as felines, however, who were almost without exception buried alongside deceased pharaohs or at the very least inscribed into their burial chamber walls. Those cats that rose from the dead- either because of the foul magical energies of a pharaoh's crypt or thanks to the necromantic magic of a restless undead pharaoh herself-were known as ubashki. Ubashki were prized for being stealthy, agile, and preternaturally perceptive sentries that made for effective spies and watch guards for the tombs of Osirian god-kings. Emperors often filled their crypts with the bodies of strangled and mutilated cats before they themselves were entombed, believing that a feline's suffering in life would translate to strength in undeath. Whether or not such theories were true is up for debate, but those felid creatures that did rise from death with their masters were indeed beasts to be reckoned with, and a sizeable pack of the mummified things could very well spell the end for would-be tomb raiders. Ranging from tiny housecats to desert-roaming mountain lions, the feline enshrined with a deceased pharaoh varied in type depending on the predilections of its master, but all were known to be signif icantly more powerful than their living iterations.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Piercing Howl (Su) When an ubashki lynx howls, all creatures except other undead within a 300-foot spread must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or become frightened for 1d4 rounds. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect. Whether or not the save is successful, an affected creature is immune to the same ubashki lynx's piercing howl for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based. Ubashki Rot (Su) Curse and disease-bite; save Fort DC 16; onset 1 hour; frequency 1/day; effect 1d6 Str and 1d6 Wis; cure -. Ubashki rot is both a curse and a disease and can only be cured if the curse is first removed, at which point the disease can be magically removed. Even after the curse element of ubashki rot is lifted, a creature suffering from it cannot recover naturally over time. Anyone casting a conjuration (healing) spell on the afflicted creature must succeed at a DC 20 caster level check, or the spell is wasted and the healing has no effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>

    <SpecialAbilities>Burst of Speed (Ex) Once every 1d4 rounds, a ngoga can summon a burst of energy in order to move twice its base speed in a single move action.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>In the tropical rainforests of the Kaava Lands and the Mwangi Jungle lurk animalistic offshoots of the cyclopes that once dominated the region. Known as ngogas, these half-orangutan, half-cyclops hybrids are infamous in the folktales of the Mwangi peoples, who fear them for their unpredictability and unnatural agility. In cyclops legends, the ngogas were a gift to the Ghol-Gani from their otherworldly patrons near the collapse of the empire, magical beings infused with the brutality and insight afforded cyclopes, but lacking the intelligence that would make them viable competitors. Ghol-Gani soldiers often trained these beasts to follow them into battle and fight alongside them, and present-day cyclopes who encounter ngogas inevitably feel a sort of kinship to the similarly monocular beasts, enticing them with gifts of fruit and meat in order to gain an ally in their destructive conquests. Since the fall of Ghol-Gan, ngogas have proliferated throughout the dense jungles of central Garund, and many of their kind can be found as deep as Usaro, where the destructive Gorilla King trains them as war-mounts for his smaller minions and relies on their bestial speed to stage ambushes against any who would dare t o intrude upon his realm.</Description>

    <Source>Lost Kingdoms</Source>
    <IsTemplate>0</IsTemplate>
    <SpecialAbilities>Castle (Ex) A behemoth golem has a small stronghold built onto its back. Up to eight Medium creatures can occupy this tower by climbing onto the behemoth golem with a DC 25 Climb check (DC 10 if the golem is willing). A creature occupying the tower can choose either to hide in the castle's interior, gaining total cover as long as it remains within the structure but losing the ability to attack anything outside of the tower, or to stand on the parapet around the perimeter of the tower, gaining partial cover thanks to the battlement surrounding the walkway. A behemoth golem's castle moves with the creature itself, and though creatures occupying the castle count as occupying the same square as the golem, they cannot be engaged in melee unless their opponent is also occupying the castle. A behemoth golem can shake off unwanted occupants by making a combat maneuver check as a full-round action; any creatures currently occupying the castle must succeed at a Reflex save (DC equal to the result of the behemoth golem's combat maneuver check). Creatures standing on the parapet that fail their save fall out of the castle, landing in the nearest empty square and taking 5d6 points of falling damage (6d6 if standing on the uppermost parapet); creatures hiding within the castle that fail their saves are jumbled about and take 10d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC for half damage). Immunity to Magic (Su) A behemoth golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and abilities function differently against the creature. • A stone to flesh spell negates a behemoth golem's damage reduction for 1 round. • A transmute rock to mud spell slows a behemoth golem as the slow spell for 1d4 rounds (no save). • A magical attack that deals acid damage heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A behemoth golem gets no save against acid effects. Quake (Su) As a standard action once per day, a behemoth golem can stomp its two front feet down, creating a ripple of destruction in a 60-foot cone. This effect is otherwise identical to earthquake (caster level 17th).</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Behemoth golems are elephantine constructs once crafted by the artificers of the ancient Jistka Imperium. Rather than use elemental spirits to fuel the constructs' animation, artificers made pacts with demons, daemons, and devils from the evil Outer Planes, and bound their spirits to these titanic horrors to bring them to life. Though from a distance they resemble armored mammoths with a castle attached to their back, a behemoth golem's flesh is in fact made of tons of mined stone, and its tusks and teeth are carved from rare minerals similar in density to ivory. The main body of a behemoth golem is 40 feet tall, with the highest part of the tower reaching 60 feet. Construction While the methods for creating a behemoth golem are largely considered lost along with so much Jistkan lore, a character who finds herself in possession of one of Jistka's fabled behemoth golem manuals gains the knowledge required to construct such a mammoth being. A behemoth golem is built from 70,000 pounds of rocks and rare minerals treated with profane oils worth 25,000 gp. Behemoth Golem CL 18th; Price 305,000 gp CONSTRUCTION Requirements Craft Construct, earthquake, geas/quest, mage's magnificent mansion, wish, creator must be at least caster level 18th; Skill Craft (stonemasonry) and Knowledge (history) DC 26; Cost 165,000 gp</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Gibber (Su) Vescavors yammer the endless chorus of the Abyss. Any creature within 15 feet of a vescavor swarm or inside it must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or be confused for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting compulsion insanity effect. A creature that saves cannot be affected by the same vescavor swarm's gibbering for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based. Ravenous (Ex) Vescavors can devour nearly anything, with the exception of adamantine. If the swarm attacks an object or structure, the vescavors ignore its hardness if it is made of any substance other than adamantine. Additionally, every round that a creature is in the same space as the swarm, the vescavors begin devouring one object on the creature. The object takes half its maximum hit points in damage and gains the broken condition. If the vescavors attack an object with the broken condition, it is destroyed. An attended or magic object can make a DC 15 Reflex save to negate this effect. The save DC is Constitution-based. Traumatizing (Su) Vescavors embody the meanest depravities of the Outer Rifts, and walking among them is akin to being trapped in the Abyss itself. Any creature that spends more than 3 rounds inside a vescavor swarm must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or gain one of the types of madness presented on page 250 of the Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide. Roll on the Types of Insanity table to determine which type of insanity affects the creature-the creature does not make another Will save against the specific insanity. This affliction is permanent, but can be healed as detailed in the Curing Insanity section of the Sanity and Madness rules. The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>And those who linger near the Worldwound eventually discover that more than demons clawed through the rift between worlds. Once known only to the lightless crevices and shrieking half-live jungles of the Abyss, the yammering, gnashing stray teeth of the Outer Rifts have also been unleashed upon Golarion-the gluttonous vermin of the Abyss called vescavors.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Claws (Ex) An inverted giant can channel arcane energy into its fists whenever it makes a successful claw attack, dealing 1d6 points of energy damage (cold, electricity, or fire, chosen when the inverted giant attacks) in addition to the damage its claws normally deal. Runes (Ex) Whenever a rune giant is affected by a spell or spell-like ability, it can cause the runes covering its body to flash with light. All creatures within 10 feet of the giant must make a DC 21 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1 round. The saving throw is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Perhaps one of the most disturbing of the runelords' creations was the inverted giant, a hideous monstrosity created when a runelord was displeased with a particular giant minion. Through despicable arcana long lost to the ages, giants were ritually bound and transformed so that they would continue to live and think, but only as monstrous caricatures of themselves, their bodies turned inside out in the most painful and gruesome of punishments. Needless to say, few inverted giants tried their masters' patience again, and the unimaginable pain they suffered throughout the rest of their days served as a maddening punishment that would remind them of their insolence until their merciful deaths. Before the Starstone fell and obliterated Thassilon, many of the runelords and their servants enchanted their inverted giant minions, freezing the tormented creatures in stasis so that centuries later they would continue to protect their masters' holdings, their mutilated organs providing sensory information among cunningly-looped entrails and viscera preserved by rune magic. Those who find themselves exploring Thassilonian dungeons and ruins sometimes stumble upon such horrors, inadvertently releasing the monsters and restoring them to raging life and madness, the pain of their mutilated bodies having long since driven them to insanity and burning hatred. No two inverted giants look the same, though some features remain fairly consistent between them. Instead of a head, most possess little more than a gaping maw the size of their neck, jagged bones and bits of skull serving as teeth for a monstrous mouth. They have no true eyes-what oracular systems they once had are now embedded somewhere near their sternums-but instead possess an innate sense of direction, and through the dark arcana that surges through their beings they can sense the location of their prey perfectly. Their moist, splotched bodies are marked with runes, and their muscles and bones are often visible through their translucent flesh. Inverted giants understand speech, but their deformed mouths rarely work well enough for them to be understood by others. The average inverted giant is over 20 feet tall and weighs 1,400 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Greater Flash of Insight (Su) Once per day as an immediate action, a cyclops can peer into an occluded visual spectrum of possible futures, gaining insight that allows it to select the exact result of one die roll before the roll is made. This effect can alter an action taken by the cyclops, and once per week the oracular cyclops can apply this ability to one creature of her choosing. The target of this boon must be within 30 feet of the oracular cyclops and be able to be seen. Protective Foresight (Su) An oracular cyclops can peer into the future to protect itself. This ability grants the cyclops a +4 insight bonus to AC.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>A cyclops oracle retains more of the powers of foresight than most of its kin. In addition to a cyclops's typical flash of insight ability, an oracular cyclops can share its gift with others, granting them a boon on a future challenge. While often smaller than others of its kind, an oracular cyclops gains the ability to foresee danger coming its way. The statistics above depict a cyclops who is served by a cult of worshippers, and is therefore in good health. Other oracular cyclopes are sometimes kept as chained prisoners, at the mercy of their captors.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Cursed Bite (Su) A coral capuchin can deliver a bite that bestows some of the creature's benefits and weaknesses upon the victim. The curse delivered by this bite persists for 1d6 hours, and cannot affect the same creature more than once in a 24-hour period. Affected creatures begin drying out when exposed to air, but can hold their breath for double the normal amount of time. Targets of this cursed bite take 1d6 points of damage for every 10 minutes they are out of water, though spending a full-round action to bathe the victim in any sort of water halts this damage. Victims must succeed at a DC 12 Constitution check to avoid this effect. Remove curse ends this curse's effect as normal. The save DC is Constitution-based. Moisture Dependency (Ex) A coral capuchin can breathe both air and water and survive indefinitely on land, but the creature must regularly be either submerged in water or thoroughly wetted down, or else it dries out in the air. A coral capuchin can survive out of water for a number of hours of equal to its Constitution score before it takes any negative effects. After this time, the creature takes 1d6 points of damage for every hour it remains dry. Bathing the creature in water of any sort resets this time frame.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Coral capuchins, when encountered outside of the water, look like a wizard's practical joke-they have the body of a small monkey, slick pink skin, a fishlike head, and membranous appendages that are a cross between a bat's wings and a fish's fins. They possess a monkey's innate intelligence and curiosity, displaying little fear of humanoids, but are also compulsive pickpockets that love the glimmer of gold and jewels, and posses the manual dexterity to relieve unsuspecting sailors and dockworkers of their hard-earned pay. An adult coral capuchin is a foot and a half in length, with a foot-long tail, a 4-foot wingspan, and a weight of 25 pounds. Ecology Sages believe coral capuchins evolved from highly adaptive creatures living in the world's oceans. It is believed these creatures first developed as wholly aquatic creatures much like fish, and lived among brightly colored coral reefs where they used a form of camouf lage to hide and escape predation, much like a cuttlefish or octopus. The creatures developed multiple methods of locomotion through evolution, and these biological changes allowed these creatures to crawl from the sea and walk on land. Eventually their fins transformed into wings, granting the creature greater mobility, and the ability not only to breathe the air above the waves, but also to soar through it. Coral capuchins are capable of surviving out of the water in their air-breathing form for part of the day, although they quickly deteriorate and die if they do not keep their bodies moist. They spend most of their lives below the waves, subsisting on small fish and all manner of vegetation, but often venture onto land to find a particularly tasty morsel, or to satisfy their overactive natural curiosity. They also love to fly and can often be seen circling the crow's nests of ships entering and leaving harbor. On land, they hunt small rodents, pick nuts and berries, and find the eggs of birds a particular delicacy. Coral capuchins also display an intense interest in the food and belongings of all manner of humanoid species. They are especially drawn to small, shiny objects, and can be counted on to abscond with anything interesting that is not nailed down. Coral capuchins' hands allow them to manipulate objects, but they cannot wield weapons. A coral capuchin is born as a wholly aquatic creature. Young coral capuchins lack the ability to fly or leave the water until they reach adulthood after approximately their first year of life. They are an incredibly fecund race, and females can produce a clutch of up to 100 eggs three times a year, though local aquatic predators usually devour most of these. Because of their dependence on returning to the water, some coral capuchins venturing too far inland risk stranding themselves. Explorers find the creatures sickly and weak, sprawled out on the jungle floor covered in biting ants or picked apart by predators as they lie there dying. Coral capuchins that die on land dry, out to a husk that often turns to dust leaving only its brittle bones behind. Habitat &amp; Society Living in greater numbers along the southeastern coast of Garund, these creatures have slowly spread out, making their way north and east over the last few centuries. A large colony of the creatures resides off the coast south of Sargava and within the Lower Korir River Delta. The canopies of the Jungle of Hungry Trees and the jungles of the Kaava Lands ring with the calls of coral capuchins. An infestation of the clever creatures has recently plagued the port city of Senghor on the Fever Sea, and a city authority has begun offering a bounty on the creatures in an attempt to reduce their numbers. A few colonies of the creatures exist farther north, with some making their homes in the warmer waters of the Inner Sea, while other curious tribes of these mischievous creatures inhabit the warm waters of the Obari Ocean on Garund's western coast. Coral capuchins live in tropical coastal areas, generally in small familial groups of fewer than 30 adults led by an older female. The first part of their name refers not only to their pinkish skin color, but also to their preferred nesting place-the coral reefs off of Garund's coast, where they make their homes in the countless caves and crevices found therein. They populate these vivid reefs to lay their eggs and hide among the protective growth, adapting their skin pigmentation to blend in. Wholly unafraid of most humanoid species, coral capuchins are often domesticated by sailors and fisherman willing to put up with the creatures' incurable curiosity and penchant for petty larceny. They are often trained to fish for their masters, and are particularly sought after by those who make their living bringing up treasures from the ocean floor. Because of their love for shiny objects, they make excellent pearl divers, although it can sometimes be a struggle to get them to part with their treasures. Their voracious, omnivorous appetites also make them popular on long ocean voyages, as they are happy to reduce ships' endemic rat populations. Perhaps because of this, many sailors see them as good-luck mascots, although they are most popular with pirates, smugglers, and other such seafaring folk, who more willingly accept their thieving nature. Coral Capuchins as Familiars Despite their mercurial temperaments and propensity for theft, coral capuchins are prized by wizards because of the creatures' exceptional mobility and their strange cursed bite. This bite allows spellcasters greater ability to explore below the waves, as long as they pay close attention to their time outside of the water. Despite this benef it, coral capuchins are more popular among spellcasters who don't mind running afoul of the law, as the small creatures' thieving behavior is diff icult to fully control and often gets their masters into trouble. In addition, coral capuchins' need to stay moistened means they are better suited to serve as familiars for those living near water or willing to make compensations for this unusual physiology. Spellcasters of 3rd level or higher with an alignment within one step of neutral can gain a coral capuchin as a familiar by taking the Improved Familiar feat.</Description>

    <Description>The largest of all known crocodilians, the 35- to 50-foot-long, 6-ton deinosuchus is a massive beast. This crocodilian possesses a shorter, rounder snout than the typical crocodile, and thus resembles a giant alligator. A patient hunter, the deinosuchus is all but invisible beneath the surface of the water. Only its nostrils breach the water's surface, allowing the rest of its formidable mass to remain out of sight from even highly perceptive prey. In combat, the deinosuchus grinds its prey between its powerful jaws, knocking back other foes with its formidable tail while it snaps bones and tears the flesh of its captured meal.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Death Dive (Ex) When grappling a foe of its size or smaller, a marine crocodile can perform a deadly dive upon making a successful grapple check. As it clings to its foe, it uses the force of its powerful tail to propel it downward in the water, allowing it to use both the move and damage actions as part of its grapple attempt. If successful, the marine crocodile maintains its grapple. Hold Breath (Ex) A marine crocodile can hold its breath a number of rounds equal to 8 times its Constitution score before it risks drowning.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The marine crocodile resembles its land-based cousins in general body shape and size, though its legs are a hybrid of webbed feet and nascent fins. Its long tail is thinner and flatter than those of traditional crocodilians, allowing the marine crocodile to swim with alarming speed as it whips its tail back and forth. Marine crocodiles generally remain in warm, shallow oceans and seas. They spend most of their time at sea hunting fish, sea mammals, aquatic humanoids, and monstrous humanoids like merfolk, sahuagin, and locathahs. Only when breeding and laying eggs do marine crocodiles venture onto land (where they are slow and clumsy), before returning to the sea.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Death Roll (Ex) When grappling a foe of its size or smaller, a saltwater crocodile can perform a death roll upon making a successful grapple check. As it clings to its foe, it tucks in its legs and rolls rapidly, twisting and wrenching its victim. The crocodile deals its bite damage and knocks the creature prone. If successful, the crocodile maintains its grapple. Hold Breath (Ex) A saltwater crocodile can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to 4 times its Constitution score before it risks drowning. Lunging Bite (Ex) Once per minute, a saltwater crocodile can extend the reach of its bite attack by 5 feet without taking the normal penalties to AC associated with the Lunge feat. This extended reach applies only to the crocodile's bite attack and lasts until the start of the creature's next turn.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Native to tropical saltwater estuaries and the freshwater rivers that feed them, saltwater crocodiles are among the largest form of non-primordial crocodilian on Golarion. Adult saltwater crocodiles can reach lengths upward of 20 feet and weights of over 2,000 pounds, and are typically more lethargic than their smaller kin, spending their days sunning themselves on land or in shallow water and hunting at night.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Blow Smoke (Su) Smoke constantly drifts from a kapre's mouth, and as a standard action it can exhale a 30-foot cone of smoke. Creatures in the area must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. This is a poison effect and the save DC is Constitution-based. Confounding Aura (Su) A magical aura surrounds a kapre, confusing and distracting its foes. In its more benign and playful moments, a kapre uses this aura to play tricks on passersby, throwing them off course and toying with their sense of direction. In a defensive capacity, the aura makes it much harder for creatures to track a kapre, and might unnerve them enough to drive them from an area the kapre is trying to protect. Within a kapre's aura, the DC of all Survival checks is increased by +15 and creatures trained in Survival are no longer able to automatically determine true north. On top of this, any creature within a kapre's aura must make a successful DC 21 Will saving throw when it enters the area or take a -4 penalty on concentration checks, initiative checks, and skill checks. A kapre can supress this aura at will. Tree-Meld (Su) A kapre can merge itself with a tree as a move action. While melded with a tree, the kapre can both see and hear as if it were standing outside the tree, and can speak normally. Minor physical damage to the tree does not harm the kapre, but if the tree is chopped down or destroyed by fire before the kapre exits, the kapre is slain. The kapre can exit the tree as a move action.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Vehement defenders of unusual natural locations, kapres have a complicated relationship with the "civilized" races. Formed of dense tree matter, they are as much part of the forest as their botanical brethren. Their intimidating physical size, territorial nature, and unusual approach to friendship often bring them into conf lict with tribesmen and aggressive explorers. Furthermore, misleading myths paint them as vicious wife-stealers, violent demons, and even bringers of riches to those who can trap them. In truth, these arboreal giants are only dangerous to those who threaten the environs under their protection. With slender limbs and thick, gnarled torsos made of twisted trunks and boughs, kapres are awkwardly humanoid in appearance, but have such rich personalities that those lucky enough call them "friend" see them as more people than plants. Festooned with hanging vines or seasonal blossoms, kapres blend in perfectly with the surrounding forest. Were it not for the soft glow of their eyes, they could be mistaken for treants. Exceedingly secretive and wary, kapres prefer to avoid conf lict where possible, using their imposing size and confounding auras to intimidate would-be invaders. Leaning out of huge trees, they blow smoke onto lost explorers, persuading them to flee from the locations the kapre protects. Even in peaceful discussions, they rarely drop their auras, aware that the most honeyed tongue can hide the cruelest intent. If things turn sour, they deal out fast and serious damage with their great wooden fists, and if their domain is breached, they fight to the death to turn invaders away. Though kapres are fearsome when their ire is raised, they are careful (and reasonable) enough to allow retreating aggressors to escape. Ecology Much of the mystery that surrounds kapres is their own doing. Although shy, they enjoy the company of other humanoids and sometimes fixate on a particular creature, often a human female. This obsession manifests as playful teasing, using their confounding auras to befuddle the objects of their affections or keep others from visiting the women. Creatures that have a tolerance for trickery can become firm friends with the tree giants, earning protection, advice, and even romance. However, those who misunderstand these complex behaviors or those close to the "victim" can sour the reputation of kapres by reacting with jealousy and rage and branding kapres as dangerous or scheming. Rumors that capturing a kapre will force it to grant wishes were almost certainly started by a jealous chieftain whose wife caught a kapre's eye. These mixed reactions have kept kapres cautious and encouraged them to develop methods of identifying and escaping traps. Their caution keeps them always ready to leap over a trip wire, snare, or spiked pit. They know their own terrain inside out, and constantly keep an ear to the ground, using their speak with plants ability to stay on top of any changes for many miles around. Habitat &amp; Society Each kapre chooses a location sacred or important to it, which it then defends with its life. The reasons for choosing a particular location might make little sense to other creatures, and when pressed a kapre usually gives a cryptic or evasive explanation. This has proved frustrating for many would-be road builders or bush farmers who cannot quite understand why a half-acre of swamp should be of interest to anyone. Furthermore, the location a kapre chooses to defend is not always where it resides, and invading a kapre's home is almost as dangerous as sullying a sacred place. It is not uncommon for a careful explorer who has given a kapre's sacred spot a wide berth to end up the target of the creature's fury when the new route runs directly through the clearing the creature calls home. A kapre's home is usually easy to identify, and resembles a druid's grove: a clearing, carefully and sensitively pruned, with a single massive tree at its center. KapreCigars Kapres roll thick cigars, using a recipe so secret (and so potent) that neither tobacconist nor alchemist can identify the ingredients. Even in the chaos of combat their enormous cigars never fall from their mouths; their thick-skinned stogies interfere with their speech, lending a lazy drawl to their creaky voices. Kapre Cigar Aura faint evocation and necromancy; CL 7 Slot none; Price 2,250 gp; Weight 4 lbs. DESCRIPTION A kapre's 2-foot-long cigar never goes out. It burns with a glow that sheds light like a candle, but does not burn other organic material. Smoking the cigar is dangerous for any but a kapre-and not just because of its size. Only a Medium or larger creature can attempt to smoke the cigar. Creatures doing so must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or become nauseated for 1 hour. Each time a creature attempts to inhale, he or she must make another save, but receives a cumulative +1 bonus for each successful inhalation in the past 24 hours. Once inhaled, the smoke can be exhanled to the detriment of nearby foes. The smoking creature must exhale within 1 round of inhaling or be nauseated for 1 round, coughing up the potent smoke into its own square. A Medium creature can blow the smoke as a standard action at one adjacent enemy. A Large or larger creature can blow the smoke in a 15-foot cone, also as a standard action. Creatures caught in the smoky cloud must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. CONSTRUCTION Requirements Craft Wondrous Item, creator must be a kapre or creation must be completed under the supervision of a kapre; Cost 1,125 gp</Description>

    <Description_Visual>From a body like a strange crab sprouts the torso of a praying mantis, clad in coral-colored crustacean armor. Swaying hypnotically, it rattles razor-sharp claws and raises its long, rapier-like tail stinger.</Description_Visual>

    <SpecialAbilities>Poison (Ex) Tetrodotoxin: Sting-injury; save Fort DC 22; frequency once; initial effect staggered for 1 round, secondary effect paralysis for 1d4 rounds; cure 2 consecutive saves. Shoreline Mastery (Ex) The multi-limbed nature of the crab half of the tetrolimulus allows it to ignore the effects of uneven or difficult terrain. This does not apply to terrain magically manipulated to impede movement.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>A terrifying mix of prehistoric arthropod and heavily armored mantis, the tetrolimulus is the stuff of nightmares for shipwrecked and abandoned mariners. Plated with a spiny crustacean exoskeleton, the upper body of the tetrolimulus is reminiscent of a very robust kind of mantis. Its raptorial forelimbs, folded as if in prayer, flash forward with frightening speed and precision to brutally slice opponents before they have had a chance to act. Captains and mutineers alike are quick to remind their enemies of these deadly claws and the creature's other name, the "beach guillotine," for the brutal justice it exacts on those put ashore for choosing the wrong side in a mutiny. With somewhat less panache, the tetrolimulus is often described as the "sea-mantis" because it resembles a crab's strong legs and shell merged with a mantis' powerful arms. Trailing behind is a scorpion's deadly stinger. The creature's durable, spiked shell covers five pairs of blade-like legs that work together to produce remarkable speeds even through challenging terrain. Truly a master of the beaches, the tetrolimulus has caught many mariners off guard with a blazing charge over varied terrain, perforating a noiseless trail through wet sand, then clattering over rocks with the sound of dice thrown across a table. Its final and most dangerous terror, held upright and waved like a regal scepter in combat, is the tetrolimulus's tail stinger. The stinger is razor sharp along its outer edge, but its neat incisions are nowhere near as dangerous as the poison that coats its blade. Those who succumb to a dose of poison-called tetrodotoxin-are soon to be a meal for the sea-mantis. Muscle spasms and cramps accompany a gradual slowing of movement, hinting at oncoming paralysis and the agony of a neat butchering while still alive for easy consumption. One of nature's cruelest poisons, tetrodotoxin is a popular tool of the Red Mantis assassins, who appreciate both the poison's painful efficacy and the mantis-form of its progenitor. Ecology Out of the water, the tetrolimulus adopts an unusual swaying movement of the upper body. Although its purpose is not entirely clear, it is thought that, much like the land-dwelling mantis, the movement enhances the creature's primitive vision and makes picking out prey by its own relative movement easier. It has been suggested that remaining completely still when confronted by a tetrolimulus may prevent detection, but none have been able to confirm the success of this tactic, and there are none who are confident enough of the theory to test it in the field. Female tetrolimuluses, the hunters of the species, are by far the more aggressive. Rarely seen, males live in deeper waters as bottom feeders, emerging only in the mating season in early spring. At this time for a few days each year, both sexes make great journeys, sometimes of hundreds of miles, to return to ancient coastal breeding grounds. Here dominant and aggressive females meet and mate with the strongest of the smaller and more delicate males. Only a small number of these males get a chance to breed, and an even smaller number survive to return to the oceans. The energy and effort of their travels exhaust the females, and once they've been impregnated, the easiest and closest source of food is the weaker males surrounding them. A fertilized female may even continue to exhibit signs of availability to encourage more males to approach her- not for reproduction, but to satisfy her more immediate hunger. Young are born at sea, and perhaps as payment for their strength and power later in life, they spend their first few months at the bottom of the food chain. Without the thick shells of maturity, they are easy prey, which contributes a great deal to population control of their species. As their shells thicken and harden, they start to enjoy a less harried existence, and by 6 months old they start to fight back. They reach maturity in 12 to 18 months and can live for up to 50 years. Tetrolimuluses' behavior is largely instinct-driven, but during the breeding season the normally nomadic creatures will fight viciously to protect the shores of their ancestral breeding grounds. Even male sea-mantises rise to combat, though at sea they more commonly flee than risk confrontation. Females can be found in the area of the Abendego Gulf, from Mediogalti Island all the way into the Shackles and as far north as the Sodden Lands. Even Rahadoum has seen the occasional tetrolimulus washed ashore to the south, where the creatures are feared as the twisted manifestations of Achaekek, conjured for worship by the Red Mantis and a stark reminder of the folly of religious devotion. There are descriptions of creatures similar to the tetrolimulus to the north, even into the Inner Sea, but these stories are as old and leaky as the ships of the pirates and traders who tell them and no reports of tetrolimuluses along the cost of Cheliax, for example, are younger than two generations. Much of tetrolimuluses' bulk is armor, and despite their size they can survive on relatively small quantities of food. In perhaps the only mark of intelligence in their species, they try to avoid overfishing, instead roaming over several miles of coastline to balance their Ecology. The majority of their diet is fish and cephalopods, but they are competent trackers and follow hints of habitation on their beaches to devour any coast-dwelling mammals foolish enough to find themselves on the beaches, including humanoids. Like most animals, tetrolimuluses tend to avoid large settlements or areas frequently visited by humans. Remote or inaccessible beaches are the females' preferred habitat, but occasionally a powerful storm rolling out of the Eye of Abendego can toss them on more popular or even populous coastlines. Surprisingly high concentrations of the creatures are found around Mediogalti Island and its outlying cluster. Some suggest this is due to deliberate cultivation by the Red Mantis, thanks to the tetrolimulus's favorable form, but it may simply be because the treacherous waters and hidden coves are perfect for their reclusive lifestyle, and the frequent mutinies, shipwrecks, and foolish adventurers provide a varied and ample diet for the brutal predators. Tetrodotoxin While none are stupid enough to actively farm sea-mantises, occasionally the corpse of one is washed up into the more accessible bays on the coasts of the Shackles or Mediogalti Island. Some of the more enterprising residents of Ilizmagorti have developed a method of harvesting the cruel tetrodotoxin poison, from which the tetrolimulus gets its name, for sale to the assassins of the Red Mantis. A single dose of tetrodotoxin sells for 1,300 gp. Its rarity and potency make it a valuable product, and prices outside the Shackles or Mediogalti Island can be 50-100% higher. One dose of poison can be harvested from the corpse of a tetrolimulus, provided the lower half of the creature is intact. This requires a DC 25 Survival check, and even those who usually find themselves competent at skinning or gutting creatures struggle with the intricacies of the sharp tail stinger. In harvesting the tetrodotoxin poison, those without the poison use ability are subject to the standard 5% chance of self-poisoning.</Description>

    <Description>Werecrocodiles merge the ruthless determination of a crocodile with the intelligence and adaptability of a humanoid, creating a maliciously cunning creature with no doubt of its martial superiority. Lacking any culture or society beyond what can be gained through physical might, these creatures are solitary hunters. Natural werecrocodiles usually stand taller and broader than an aff licted member of their species. In humanoid form, specimens often have a slight rigidity to their skin, a green tinge around their lips, or vertically slit pupils. The average male werecrocodile in human form stands 6 feet tall and has a powerful, muscular frame weighing up to 250 pounds, with females averaging slightly shorter and lighter. Ecology Most werecrocodiles prefer warm rivers, coastlines, and swamps-ideally within a day's travel of a humanoid community where they can stalk new victims. They favor fresh humanoid kills, but they also eat fish, small waterfowl, or anything else they can chase down and kill. Voracious predators, these creatures either kill and eat or otherwise drive away most other local, predatory species. Werecrocodiles delight in the power their forms give them over others and enjoy nothing more than terrorizing their prey before the kill. Such creatures often pose as river guides or experienced woodsmen in order to lead their chosen targets away from the safety of civilization. Once in the wild, a werecrocodile prefers to take the first opportunity it can to maim its victim before allowing the prey to escape. It then hunts the poor soul down, dragging it into the water and drowning it, then either devouring it or stashing the body in a mudbank for a later meal. Werecrocodiles often join groups of adventurers in hopes of just such opportunities. If its secret is discovered before the trap is sprung, a werecrocodile fights until the tide of battle turns against it, then flees to stalk its chosen victims from a distance. Habitat &amp; Society While werecrocodiles typically enjoy the solitude of their territories, small colonies of them can sometimes be found scattered throughout isolated swamplands. Most stories suggest that it takes a particularly strong and malicious werecrocodile to hold others of its kind in sway. Despite the believed preference for solitude, when these creatures do come upon each other, conf lict is rare. As long as they heed one another's territorial boundaries, individuals hold an underlying tolerance of each other. However, when conf lict does arise between werecrocodiles, such battles are typically to the death. Any dispute relating to territories or mates has only one rule: the victor may do as he wishes with his prize. This amuses any female being fought over, as even when a challenger defeats an opponent, if the female is unamused or unimpressed, she often simply kills the victor and feeds on his remains before going on her way. The borders of werecrocodile hunting grounds are adorned with skulls slung together with varying forms of aquatic vegetation and hung from trees along or across waterways. These blatant displays serve a dual purpose: to warn away any potential encroachers and to evoke fear and anxiety in intelligent prey as soon as they enter the lycanthrope's territory. A werecrocodile's prowess correlates directly with the size and number of the skulls displayed on the borders of its territory. In areas where werecrocodiles are know to lair, locals often treat strangers met alone in the wilderness with extreme distrust. In some communities, a wanderer that approaches without first displaying an object of silver worn against the skin is shunned, or attacked outright if he seems aggressive. Because of their fascination with the power that their forms give them over lesser races, werecrocodiles rarely turn others into lycanthropes. Any aff licted werecrocodile was able enough to escape his hunter and survive whatever wounds he suffered. Aff licted werecrocodiles are often more malicious and cruel than their natural brothers, masking their self-loathing and despair with bloodsoaked acts of violence. Whether due to the werecrocodiles' unremitting despair, or their inability to control their alternate form's lust for violence and blood, these rampages end only with the death of the werecrocodile or the death of all innocents that the beast can find.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Death Roll (Ex) When grappling a foe of its size or smaller, a werecrocodile can perform a death roll upon making a successful grapple check. As it clings to its foe, it tucks in its legs and rolls rapidly, twisting and wrenching its victim. The werecrocodile deals its bite damage and knocks the creature prone. If successful, the werecrocodile maintains its grapple. Hold Breath (Ex) A werecrocodile can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to 4 times its Constitution score before it risks drowning. Sprint (Ex) Once per minute a werecrocodile may sprint, increasing its land speed to 60 feet for 1 round.</SpecialAbilities>

    <SpecialAbilities>Leviathan's Call (Su) The tone of a bakekujira's eerie song varies from that of a wistful memory to a burning, pain-wracked hatred. As a standard action, a bakekujira can alter its song to make creatures either fascinated or frightened. All living creatures within a 120-foot radius must succeed at a DC 28 Will save or gain one of the conditions (bakekujira's choice) for as long as the bakekujira sings. The bakekujira can maintain the song using a standard action each round, though affected creatures receive a new save each round to end the effect. Any creature that succeeds at this save cannot be affected by the same bakekujira's leviathan's call ability for 24 hours. This is a sonic mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. Resonant Song (Su) As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, the bakekujira can release a single pure note that causes a damaging resonance, dealing 12d8 points of sonic damage to all creatures in a 60-foot cone (Fortitude DC 28 halves). The save DC is Charisma-based. Smashing Breach (Ex) As a full-round action, a swimming bakekujira can make a special charge attack against creatures on the surface of the water. At the end of its charge, the whale breaches, then slams down onto the target with incredible force. Any Huge or smaller creatures in the bakekujira's space must succeed at a DC 28 Reflex save or take 4d8+24 points of bludgeoning damage and be forced into the nearest empty square adjacent to the bakekujira. Any humanoid creatures killed by this ability rise as draugr (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 110) in 1d6 hours. Animals or vermin killed by this attack rise as either skeletons (Bestiary 250) or zombies (Bestiary 288) in 1d6 hours. A bakekujira can use its capsize special attack in conjunction with this ability. The save DC is Charisma-based. Undead Parasites (Su) A bakekujira's rotting flesh is infused with necromantic energy. Creatures feeding on the beast's carcass (such as fish, insects, and sea-going birds) sicken and die, later rising as undead thralls. This host of carrion eaters manifests itself as a sickening cloud of sea birds and fish churning within 30 feet of the bakekujira in both air and sea. Any creatures coming within 30 feet of the bakekujira must succeed at a DC 28 Will save or be nauseated for 1 round as per the distraction special ability. In addition, those entering this area take 6d6 points of damage as this undead swarm pecks, claws, and chews on living flesh. Any animal, humanoid, or vermin killed by these parasites rises as a skeleton or zombie in 1d6 hours. Creatures with the ability to channel positive energy can suppress this aura by using one of their uses of channel energy. The bakekujira receives a Will save against this effect. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 of the caster's level + the caster's Charisma modifier. If the bakekujira fails this save the undead parasite aura is suppressed for 1 minute. Channel energy used in this way has no other effect (it does not harm the bakekujira or any other undead in the area.)</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The seas of Golarion are home to many legends both living and undead, but the bakekujiras is perhaps one of the largest among these latter horrors. Some have trouble believing the old stories, but woe to anyone that discovers the truth. These embodiments of corrupted majesty prowl the seas, along with their flocks and schools of pestilent parasites. A bakekujira weighs about 50 tons, though sometimes less, depending on how long it has been decomposing. Bakekujiras are as large as they were in their former lives, measuring from 50 to 60 feet long. Ecology Though the exact circumstances vary, the story of each bakekujira is similar: It was nothing more than an ordinary whale when whalers attacked. The whale managed to escape, but sustained a grievous wound from a whaler's harpoon. It died after days of anger and pain, only to arise as an undead monstrosity bent on taking revenge for its demise. As a bakekujira goes about its new, corrupted existence, it continues to rot until all the flesh is stripped from its bones, leaving behind only an immense skeletal whale. The decomposition process draws all sorts of sea scavengers to the rotting whale, from gulls to fish. However, the flesh of a bakekujira is not only rotten-it is also toxic and deeply infused with negative energy. Any creature that eats of this flesh sickens and dies, only to rise shortly thereafter and continues its existence as an undead thrall inexplicably bound to the bakekujira. Normally these creatures take up residence in and around the putrefied body of the bakekujira, swarming throughout the creature and only emerging to push back any who would seek to do harm to their rotting host. The bakekujira is relentless in its mission to upset and capsize any vessels reminding it of its descent into unlife, though because of the vastness of the sea, its quarry can be scarce. When a bakekujira does come across a ship, its rage is such that the beast cares little whether the vessel is an actual whaler or just a fishing sloop. The whale pits its full power against the ship, and is capable of capsizing all but the luckiest of ships with the most skilled captains. Bakekujiras are also able to affect the minds of the ships' crews. Their usual song is gentle, evoking thoughts of peaceful days in the sea. However, bakekujiras are able to channel their fury through their music, transferring to their victims the terror and helplessness the bakekujiras themselves experienced in their last moments of life. Using it jaws, tail, and enormous girth, a bakekujira attacks relentlessly until its angry spirit is laid to rest. Habitat &amp; Society While there are stories about pods of bakekujiras collaborating to lay waste to fleets and port towns, it is unlikely that the massive undead beasts would even notice each other. They are creatures of destruction and see other creatures, even their own kind, as mere obstacles in their pursuit to wreak as much havoc as possible. This doesn't mean that multiple bakekujiras never attack the same target; rather, they simply attack independently, motivated by their own individual anger. On rare occasions, large creatures such as giant vultures and dire sharks feed alongside the bakekujira's undead parasites. These creatures frequently succumb to these parasites and join the throng, swimming or flying alongside the bakekujira and taking a more active role than the whale's aura suggests. A GM can enhance encounters with bakekujiras by providing other undead creatures as auxiliary foes. Below is a list of appropriate animals typically encountered among a bakekujira's larger undead parasites, either with the skeleton or zombie template applied.

    <SpecialAbilities>Hold Breath (Ex) A blue whale can hold its breath a number of rounds equal to 10 times its Constitution score before it risks drowning. Powerful Tail (Ex) A blue whale's massive tail deals more damage than a normal tail slap. The blue whale's tail slap is a primary attack and applies 1-1/2 times its Strength bonus to its tail slap damage. Stun (Ex) A blue whale's fluke can deliver a powerful stunning blow. A creature struck by this attack must succeed at a DC 34 Fortitude save or be dazed for 1 round. If the strike is a critical hit and the target fails its save, it is instead stunned for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Strength-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The imposing blue whale is one of the largest animals in the sea, though it is generally docile toward anything it doesn't perceive as a threat. A filter-feeder, the blue whale does not look at humans or ships as potential meals, instead preferring to eat millions of tiny invertebrates known as krill, which it sucks through its baleen in massive gulps. The most dangerous thing about a blue whale, other than its sheer size, is its powerful tail, which can capsize boats and kill humanoids. These enormous mammals can be found in all of Golarion's oceans and seas. An adult blue whale is 100 feet long and weighs 200 tons.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Hold Breath (Ex) Narwhals are expert deep divers, and a narwhal can hold its breath a number of minutes equal to 2 times its Constitution score before it risks drowning. Tusk (Ex) A charging narwhal can make a single gore attack with its tusk in place of its normal bite attack.

    <Description>The narwhal is a skilled hunter in arctic waters, and has been known to dive deeper than even much larger cetaceans both in open water and beneath thick sheets of waterborne ice. Male narwhals possess a single, 6-foot-long tusk extending from just above the mouth that serves to impress females during mating season, though in times of need the tusks may be used to break through thick ice or even in self-defense. A typical narwhal is 14 feet long (not including the tusk) and weighs 3,200 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Eel Dart (Ex) A galvo can launch one of its component eels like a dart up to 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. An eel dart deals 1d6+3 points of damage plus 1d6 points of electricity damage. Swarmlike (Ex) A galvo has no discernible anatomy, and is not subject to critical hits or flanking. It is also immune to any physical spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as disintegrate). Mind-affecting effects that target a single creature function normally against a galvo, since the creature's individual components share a hive mind. A galvo takes half again as much damage (+50%) from damaging area effects such as fireball and splash weapons. Varied Attack (Ex) A galvo's slam attack deals both bludgeoning and slashing damage since the creature is formed completely of biting eels.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>In a sunless trench in the Arcadian Ocean, deep siyokoy fleshcrafters created the first galvos to serve as soldiers in their war against the sahuagin and skum. Since those days, galvos have moved beyond their darkened trenches, breeding and expanding into shallower, warmer waters. In recent years, they have begun to come closer to civilizations, preying on coastal communities. A true horror to look upon, a galvo averages 7 feet tall and weighs around 300 pounds. Ecology Direct sunlight dries out a galvo's hide. This does not harm the galvo in the short term, but it causes discomfort. As a result, galvos prefer to stay deep underwater during the day and stalk the shadows by docks and riverbanks at night. A galvo can live both in the water and on land, and frightening stories tell of galvos springing up from the water to strike at prey both on ships and on beaches. While an electric eel's diet of invertebrates and fish would easily sustain a galvo physically, it would not satisfy the sadistic creature's appetite for terror. Invertebrates and fish accept death too easily; galvos prefer prey that screams. Galvos do not wear armor or wield weapons. They attack with their natural weapons which are augmented with potent electrical charges. Much like the electric eels that form their bodies, galvos focus their energy into concentrated electricity, and discharge it with a touch. Even without their formidable electric powers, galvos are dangerous creatures. The eels that make up their bodies tear at their victims with biting mouths. To attack opponents outside their reach, galvos launch component eels from their swarming bodies. When a galvo kills a target, it feasts as soon as it safely can, usually after bringing the victim back to its underwater cave lair. The victim is stripped of any bulky metal armor and weapons, then subsumed into the galvo's writhing body, which peels apart and engulfs the corpse to swiftly and brutally devour its prey. A galvo discards the bones of its victims from its swarming body as they are picked clean. If the meal is small enough, a galvo can maintain its normal activities while it digests, chewing and tearing apart one meal as it hunts for another. Galvos defend themselves with a greater fervor when digesting, but do not attack as aggressively, as they are not usually in the habit of killing more than they can consume at one time. Despite their propensity to work together during mating seasons, galvos do not actually require other galvos to reproduce. As galvos are composed of eels of both sexes, all eels forming a galvo are attracted to one another during these two months and the creatures appear more tightly wound, reducing their size slightly. Instead, the female component eels lay eggs within the swarm, which are inseminated by the male component eels. When the eggs hatch it appears as though a tiny swarm of eels simply emerges from the larger parent galvo, leading many observers to incorrectly assume galvos reproduce asexually. There is no sexual interaction between separate galvos. They instead come together in cohabitation, working together to attack prey and feed. Typically each galvo births three to 10 infant tangles during this time. Adult galvo cohabitants care for the entire nest, not caring to keep track of which galvo birthed which tangle. As the mating season ends, the galvos find themselves less interested in one another. They drift apart towards the end of this hormonal phase, and each returns to its own lair. At this time, the infant tangles are expected to leave as well and fend for themselves. Only about half of all galvo infants survive to reach adulthood. When a galvo reaches adulthood, it claims a permanent lair. Ideal lairs are underground caves, although any large clearing between rocks and out of direct sunlight is satisfactory. A galvo primarily hunts the area near its lair, specifically the land above, where prey is plentiful and one catch makes a large enough meal to sustain it for several days. The magically enhanced galvo hive mind develops a higher intellectual capacity than individual electric eels ever could, showing a level of intelligence approaching that of a below-average human. Galvos cannot speak, but they learn to understand languages when living among or near creatures that communicate verbally. If their need to cause harm is met and they are provided an aquatic living space, galvos sometimes even come to be loyal followers of more powerful creatures. This is especially true for siyokoys, who keep large stables of galvos at the ready in their endless fight against the sahuagin and skum. Underwater, electric eels are irresistibly drawn to galvos out of a mix of familiarity and curiosity. Galvos, for their part, typically tolerate such followers for short periods of time before spurning the pests. There has never been a recorded case of a stray electric eel being absorbed into the swarm, although there have been many cases of galvos tiring of mundane eels' company and cannibalizing these followers. Habitat &amp; Society There is no true galvo society. Galvos sometimes work together, but these alliances often are short and last only through a single hunt and feeding. The strange creatures make exceptions during their two-month mating season, when spawned and fertilized eggs require additional protection in order to survive. Galvos do not use items nor intentionally collect wealth. However, when they consume a victim, galvos indiscriminately eat its belongings during their hasty meal. Whatever gear on the corpse of a victim was too big to be eaten is expelled nearby, most often in the galvo's underwater lair. Reports tell of undigested gems and other valuables being found in the gutted component eels of a freshly killed galvo. In extremely rare circumstances, traditionally worn wondrous items (like a headband of inspired wisdom or a belt of mighty constitution) caught within component eels sometimes convey their magical effects to the galvo.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Murderer's Reward (Su) If the Stabbing Beast's attack reduces a target to fewer than 0 hit points, the Beast immediately gains 2d6 temporary hit points. If the attack kills the target, the Beast immediately gains 3d8 temporary hit points. Neither aspect of this ability can heal the Stabbing Beast more than the maximum hit points of the target. The temporary hit points last for 1 hour. Poison (Ex) Sting-injury; save Fort DC 26; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Str; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based. Poison Stream (Ex) The Stabbing Beast can force a stream of poison from its stinger at a target as a ranged attack. The target must make a successful DC 26 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4+1 rounds. This attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment. The Beast can make this attack in place of a melee sting attack (for example, attacking twice with its weapons or claws and once with its poison stream). Scorpion Mind (Ex) Though the Stabbing Beast is an intelligent outsider, its mind functions much like an augmented vermin's brain, granting it a +4 bonus on all saving throws against mind-affecting effects. Scorpion Strike (Ex) The Stabbing Beast can make a single melee attack as a standard action. If this attack hits, it deals damage normally, and the target's base land speed is reduced to 5 feet for 2 rounds unless it succeeds at a DC 21 Fortitude saving throw. Sudden Strike (Ex) The Stabbing Beast is adept at moving quickly when its foes are surprised. During a surprise round, it may act as if it had a full round to act, rather than just one standard action.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The Stabbing Beast is the herald of Norgorber, the god of greed, murder, secrets, and poison. It is an incredibly dangerous predator, a creature of immense strength that uses its keen intellect and deadly poison to stalk and kill its prey. Its natural form is that of an huge scorpion, but it can also assume an armored humanoid shape suitable for stealth or interacting with Norgorber's followers. Though its main purpose for coming to Golarion is to kill, it has also been called to aid great thefts and bury terrible secrets. The Stabbing Beast enjoys the company of mortals in the same way that a well-fed barn cat enjoys the company of mice. It sometimes "plays" with these toys, teaching them secrets of alchemy or assassination, though it just as often maims or kills them as it sees fit or according to Norgorber's greater plans. It ignores most creatures as if they were unimportant or not even alive, bowling over these irrelevant people in its way and casually murdering those who make nuisances of themselves. Ecology The Stabbing Beast is guilty of thousands of killings and has no fear of death. It does not believe that anything other than its master can kill it, despite mortal records showing that it has been killed in the past; Norgorber wiped its memory of these failures when he resurrected his herald. Norgorber's herald is normally emotionless and cold, showing no remorse or regret for any death or injury. When the cult of Norgorber summons the Stabbing Beast, the mortals may present it with several choice targets to hunt and slay, though predicting its interests is difficult and the Beast may select its own target-or none at all- in exchange for its services. The Beast keeps trophies of its kills by covering the corpses in a preservative bile, swallowing them in its scorpion form, and regurgitating them when it returns to its lair deep beneath the planar metropolis of Axis. Habitat &amp; Society The herald of Norgorber lives only to serve his dark master, whose mandates may come to the Stabbing Beast in a steady stream of evil deeds or sporadically and with long periods of dormancy between. When idle for too long, it tends to turn off its mind and simply waits in stasis, completely inert like a clockwork device that has run down. It reacts to prayers to Norgorber as if they were echoes of its master's voice, drawing its attention without violence and bringing it to full alertness.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Deflective Wings (Ex) As a standard action, an angelic guardian can spread its wings and protect a single adjacent creature from the next ranged attack. The next time the protected creature would normally be hit with an attack from a ranged attack, the attack is instead deflected and the protected creature takes no damage. An angelic guardian can only deflect one ranged attack per turn in this way. This effect lasts until the angelic guardian's next turn or until the protected creature leaves its square, whichever comes first. Metallic Feathers (Ex) An angelic guardian's wings are honed to razor-sharp edges, and attacks with them deal slashing damage instead of bludgeoning damage.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Those toiling in the Golemworks of Magnimar provide myriad goods to their buyers, but perhaps none are so popular as the highly sought-after angelic guardian. Nobles, entrepreneurs, and wealthy paranoiacs alike purchase angelic guardians to serve as their personal protectors. Though inspired by Varisian depictions of angelic beings, these metallic beings are not truly from another plane, but are instead merely stylized automatons designed to watch over and protect their masters. They can be found throughout much of the Summit, where they line aristocrats' gardens and stand stoically for days or even weeks without moving, their burning halos the only feature suggestive of animation. Angelic guardians can be forged from various substances, though their bodies are typically made from brass and their wings from steel. Angelic guardians stand nearly 7 feet tall and weigh 2,000 pounds. Construction An angelic guardian is made from 2,000 pounds of metal that is treated with unguents and ointments worth 2,000 gp. Angelic Guardian CL 9th; Price 22,000 gp CONSTRUCTION Requirements Craft Construct, mage armor, scorching ray, creator must be caster level 10th; Skill Craft (sculpture) or Knowledge (engineering) DC 15; Cost 12,000 gp</Description>

    <IsTemplate>0</IsTemplate>
    <Description>Magnimar's relatively loose laws and the aff luence of the Vista district bring members of the Aspis Consortium to the city in droves. Their primary base of operations in Varisia is located in this district, a bronze-faced building with heavy doors emblazoned with sigils of three intertwined asps. The Aspis Consortium has had a presence in Magnimar for nearly a century, though agents have had to proceed more cautiously of late, following the recent founding of a Pathfinder lodge in the city. Aspis agents in Magnimar favor no particular class, and agents from all walks of life can be found throughout the city. Some are rogues or fighters, while others practice the arcane arts as sorcerers or wizards. Quite a few, however, come from the ranks of bards, utilizing their various skills, social graces, and musical talents to covertly extort buyers, to beat Pathfinders to major finds, or simply to steal such treasures out from under Pathfinders' very noses. As with Aspis headquarters in other parts of the Inner Sea, the leadership of Magnimar's Consortium is broken up into a strict hierarchy of power. The lowest and most common members are paid mercenaries who partake in the various odd jobs assigned by true Aspis agents, whether such tasks involve pillaging Thassilonian ruins or taking care of pesky competitors who would seek to hinder the Consortium's endeavors. Bronze agents are made up of Magnimar's dockworkers, freelancers, and lowly adventurers seeking money and improved status, while those agents wielding silver emblems organize the activities of their underlings throughout the regions surrounding the city. Only a couple gold agents operate in Magnimar, though their inf luence and power extends to nearly all the corners of Varisia, and their word is law as far as lesser agents are concerned. While the NPC depicted here represents a city-based agent who excels at espionage, deceit, and other urbane tactics, those working for the Aspis Consortium in Magnimar take myriad forms. The company has enlisted warlords and wizards alike, and even some adventuring groups find their way onto the Consortium's payroll-all it takes is the gumption and means to find lost treasures and bring them back to the auction house, as well as a certain lack of ethics and a strong sense of cupidity for those who wish to rise in rank.</Description>

    <Description>Magnimar has few laws for a city its size, but it still employs a sizable force of guards, centralized within the towering Arvensoar. Guards walk the streets regularly, policing the various quarters and maintaining peace throughout the city, though the wealthier districts see noticeably more protection than areas such as the Shadow. Magnimar's city guards are trained to detain criminals and keep the peace without needless violence, using nonlethal force in all but the most extreme cases.</Description>

    <Description>Magnimarian watch captains are selected from the ranks of proven city guards and undergo more training than standard troops. Captain Acacia Uriana demands intelligent watch captains, and many are trained in investigative techniques to help solve ongoing crimes throughout the city, as well as to collect valuable evidence that helps determine a suspect's guilt or innocence. Watch captains train in deadlier weapons than their more common counterparts, and most prefer to wield two blades at a given time; like city guards, however, they prefer to use nonlethal means to handle minor crimes, and are adept at disarming their opponents with their swordbreaker daggers.</Description>

    <Description>Just as the legendary Mistress Ordellia Whilwren once prayed to a mysterious angel to save Magnimar from a devastating deluge, other dwellers of the city have likewise devoted themselves to holy figures, including angels, azatas, and agathions. Called "mystery cultists" by most Magnimarians because of their small numbers and esoteric manner of worship, the dedicated followers of the empyreal lords keep to themselves and rarely proselytize. Most mystery cults hold at least one of Magnimar's numerous monuments in high esteem, whether for their importance in local traditions or their part in Varisian legends. Practitioners of these religions often congregate around structures such as the Arvensoar, the Irespan, or the Mistress of Angels to practice their faith, sometimes forming assemblies of over a hundred worshipers. Although the cults' gatherings can occasionally be disruptive to the flow of traffic throughout the City of Monuments, Magnimar's leaders do little to dissuade the cults' practices, which are almost wholly harmless and serve to promote life, freedom, and other righteous virtues. Three of the most commonly worshiped figures among the mystery cults of Magnimar are the empyreal lords Ashava, Soralyon, and Ylimancha (see page 25 for more information on these empyreal lords), though smaller cults to other celestial beings are not uncommon in the City of Monuments.</Description>

    <Description>Magnimar has its share of criminal elements, but the Night Scales claim to rule the city's cutthroat underworld. Their various operations and misdeeds include smuggling, extortion, theft, and even outright murder every now and then. Members of the Night Scales range from toughs to pickpockets to con artists, following a strict hierarchy of power based on skill as much as social connections. Among these ranks, the Night Scale assassins are perhaps the most feared members of the thieves' guild. Such assassins are responsible for taking care of nosy adventurers or pesky guards who don't know to mind their own business. Night Scale assassins work to silence some of Magnimar's mouthiest nobles as well as its uncorrupted political figures, and it is rumored that if one can get a hold of the shadowy gang, private parties might be able to arrange an assassination for a steep price. A Night Scale assassin puts much care and time into surveying her targets. She tails them over the course of a week, noting where they go to market, what time they wake up, and whom they talk to on a regular basis. This wealth of information allows the assassin to choose the perfect time and place for an unsuspecting hit.</Description>

    <Description>The notorious ruffians known as the Sczarni constantly prowl the civilized areas of Varisia in search of easily bamboozled merchants, travelers, and aristocrats to prey upon. Countless Sczarni thugs operate throughout Magnimar, their sheer quantity spawning numerous gangs that each possesses its own illicit specialty as well as a clearly defined turf. Indisputably, the most powerful Sczarni gang in the city is the Gallowed, who operate from a caravan of wagons perched directly below Lord-Mayor Grobaras's home, Defiant's Garden. The Gallowed sports a large number of thugs and leg-breakers, as well as its infamous Fish Tank, a 4-foot-tall glass aquarium hidden in one of the caravan's wagons and filled with swamp barracuda used to coax information out of unwilling victims. As a rule, Sczarni thugs are not needlessly violent, and prefer to concentrate their efforts on crimes that will make them the most money rather than spill the most blood. Sczarni tend toward swindles and illicit trade instead of rape or murder, leaving such brutal acts of violence to sociopaths and unscrupulous thieves' guilds. Though the Gallowed make up the most powerful Sczarni gang in Magnimar, they are far from alone, and numerous other small families constantly vie for turf and wealth throughout the City of Monuments. The Tower Girls specialize in robbery as well as extortion, and are often hired by quarreling nobles to help shame or blackmail rivals with evidence of infidelity, bastard children, or other secret failures. When not ruining lives, the Tower Girls display their impressive acrobatics onstage in the various playhouses and nightclubs of Lowcleft. Shunned even by other Sczarni gangs, the Creepers seed the streets with drugs and other illicit substances. They concoct many of the drugs in their base near Underbridge, using their runners to keep the whole city stocked with a handful of vices at any time.</Description>

    <Description>The shifty noble represents any one of the dozens of aristocrats vying for power and wealth in Magnimar. Some nobles may hail from families with a long lineage in the city, while others might trace their power to one of Magnimar's numerous merchant houses, and still others might have used inherited or hard-earned wealth to buy their way into the Council of Ushers. In Magnimar, money often speaks louder than words, and those with the coin to spare inevitably rise to power either within the ranks of the council or through the city's various other facets of political strength. While the council is primarily made up of long-lived families who have ruled Magnimar for years, new money has managed to grasp some political power in recent times as Magnimar's importance in trade continues to increase throughout the region. When the citizens of Magnimar established their formal government in 4608 ar and instated the Council of Ushers as a means of checking and balancing the power of the lord-mayor, they scarcely thought their seemingly simple political structure would become the convoluted mess it is today. What were originally 15 seats on the council belonging to the most inf luential and significant families of Magnimar have since ballooned into 117 seats filled by blasé nobles, scheming aristocrats, and avaricious merchants. Though there remain some honest members of the council who faithfully seek to represent the will of Magnimar's citizenry, such honorable endeavors are more often than not stopped up in the city's byzantine political machine. While most of the city's day-to-day business runs on the up and up, corruption and bribery find their way into numerous facets of the city-state's governing body. Spies and aristocratic messengers from Korvosa often travel to Magnimar bearing ill will or financial threats against its councilors, swaying corrupt politicians to aid their cause as the rival city-state to the east attempts to absorb one or more of Magnimar's holdings. Many of the representatives in the Council of Ushers work toward improving Magnimar's holdings and status, though some seek instead to undermine progress and sabotage their counterparts' efforts, putting personal goals and aspirations before the good of the citizens. Agents from Cheliax and Korvosa spend a significant amount of coin in their attempts to subvert the council and sow seeds of destruction among Magnimar, and these traitors to the City of Monuments are easily among the most prominent threats to the city.</Description>

    <Description>Easily the most popular public venue in Magnimar, the massive hippodrome known as Serpent's Run hosts a number of spectacles and events year-round to entertain both the citizens of Magnimar and visitors to the city. In addition to magic performances, circus acts, and sporting events, this enormous arena also plays host to the most impressive mock gladiatorial battles in western Varisia. Competitions take the form of duels or massive battles royal wherein participants use lethal weapons to deal their opponents felling blows. Many of the most successful gladiators in Magnimar are of Shoanti descent. Their unique fighting style and unusual weapons bring numerous spectators to gladiatorial events, and their strength, skill, and fearlessness make them exciting to watch. Outside the ring, Shoanti gladiators live well. Tavern owners gift brawlers with free drinks and meals after a successful bout, and canny bartenders often sponsor gladiatorial warriors, using their local celebrity to drum up more business and set their establishment apart from the rest. Such subsidized fighters are usually garnered from among the many toughs that frequent Magnimar's dives, and one can never be sure when an accidental bar brawl might turn into a potential business opportunity.</Description>

If damaged by fire, a shriezyx must make a successful Will save (DC equals the amount of fire damage dealt) or become frightened for 1 round. Poison (Ex) Bite-injury; save Fort DC 14; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Str; cure 1 save. Slowing Toxin (Su) A shriezyx's web is coated with a supernatural toxin that numbs and deadens the nerves on contact. Any creature struck by a shriezyx's web must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or become slowed (as per the spell) for 1 minute. Each round, a victim may attempt a new DC 14 Fortitude save to end the effect early. This toxin fades quickly from spun webs-it can only affect targets on the round the web is spun. Existing webs, while they remain sticky and tangled, do not have this slowing effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Devised by one of Thassilon's despotic runelords in the roiling fleshvats of Xin-Bakrakhan, shriezyx are horrific aberrations that continue to lurk in Thassilonian ruins throughout western Varisia even thousands of years after that ancient empire's collapse. A typical shriezyx is 3 feet tall and weighs 300 pounds.</Description>

    <Description>These carnivorous fish have long, writhing bodies and pointed heads. Their overdeveloped pectoral fins and widely separated dorsal fins make them swift swimmers, and their powerful jaws promise a quick and brutal death for any prey they might catch. Their tails serve as potent secondary weapons, which they use to bludgeon particularly hardy opponents before tearing them limb from limb. Swamp barracuda thrive in the tropical waters surrounding the continent of Garund, and are particularly prominent throughout the Sodden Lands and Mwangi Expanse. To the north, they can occasionally be found in the Mushfens and the Varisian Gulf in the warmer months, heading south when winter cools the waters. While they normally hunt alone or in small groups, during their migratory season, massive schools of swamp barracuda can be spotted traveling down the western Avistani coastline, where they feed on small whales as well as terrestrial creatures that wander too close to their waters. While swamp barracuda are most often found in the wild, particularly daring hunters sometimes capture them to serve either as food or pets. Swamp barracuda can survive for a long time outside their preferred climates, but often grow lax and weak if their owners fail to feed them properly or don't take care of their holding tank. Magnimar's infamous Sczarni gang, the Gallowed, uses swamp barracuda as a coercion technique against wealthy patsies as well as borrowers who fail to make a payment on time (an act made difficult by the exorbitant interest rate the Gallowed put on any loans they give out). Called the Fish Tank by those who know of it, the saltwater aquarium that houses Jaster Frallino's precious barracuda is stored in a dilapidated blue caravan wagon owned by the Gallowed, and more than one failed business partner has lost an eye, toe, or hand to "the Boss's Fish." It is also known that the Sczarni boss keeps a collection of rusty keys at the bottom of the Fish Tank, though the purpose of these mysterious items is a secret held by Frallino alone. An average swamp barracuda is about 6 feet long and weighs over 60 pounds, though specimens up to 12 feet long have been spotted in particularly remote locations.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Poison Spines (Ex) A vydrarch is covered in jagged spines that secrete a fatal poison. A creature struck by a vydrarch's tail slap attack or that strikes a vydrarch with a melee weapon without reach, an unarmed strike, or a natural weapon takes 1d6 points of piercing damage and risks being poisoned. Any creature that grapples a vydrarch takes 2d6 points of piercing damage and risks being poisoned each round. Vydrarch poison: Spine-injury; save Fort DC 24; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d2 Con, 1d2 Wis; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based. Veil of Fog (Su) As a standard action, a vydrarch can produce a bank of fog in a 100-foot spread centered on itself. This effect is otherwise identical that created by a fog cloud spell.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The terrifying creature known as the vydrarch is most well known among Magnimarians from the famous tales of the legendary paladin Alcaydian Indros battling the beast on the shores of what would become Magnimar. The vydrarch was originally thought to be an entirely unique creature, but in recent years, reports from sailors journeying across the Steaming Sea and the remains of wrecked ships washing ashore have hinted at the existence of other such beasts. Vydrarchs live solely for the thrill of destruction and chaos, but what elder force could have created such a monster is unknown. Their dual heads act in tandem to destroy vessels and devour cargo, but survivors of such attacks claim that the heads can act independently of one another if need be, occasionally talking or even arguing among themselves. A vydrarch is 40 feet long from tail to head and weighs 10 tons.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Returning Weapons (Su) Any throwing weapon wielded by a yamah gains the returning weapon special ability as long as the yamah wields it. Steal Magic (Su) As a standard action, a yamah can make a touch attack against a creature under the effect of a spell or spells and attempt to dispel the effect as per the dispel magic spell (CL 6th). If the attempt is successful, the yamah absorbs the magical energy and converts it into a bolt of force. A yamah can use a force bolt to make a ranged touch attack that deals 1d6 points of force damage for every spell level of the effect dispelled by the yamah (for example, if a yamah dispels a 2nd-level spell with its steal magic ability, the resulting force bolt deals 2d6 points of force damage; 0-level spells count as being 1st-level for the purpose of this ability). These force bolts have a range of 100 feet with no range increment. A yamah can only carry a number of force bolts equal to its Charisma bonus (5 for most yamahs), and any force bolts not used within 24 hours of obtaining them disappear and are wasted.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Yamahs travel the planes promoting the ideals of freedom and fairness, using their unique talents to rob evildoers of their magic and turn it into a weapon for good. Yamahs harbor ill will toward anyone who would use magic for cruel or evil purposes, especially necromancers and creatures that use magic to trap souls and pervert life. Though yamahs often bear a stern countenance, they nonetheless enjoy lighthearted pranks and cheery jokes when appropriate. The white markings that cover yamahs' bodies may at first appear to be tattoos, but are in fact natural sigils that are unique to each individual. The average yamah stands just over 6 feet tall and weighs 140 pounds. Because of the presence of the mystery cults in Magnimar and the open worship of empyreal lords-especially Ashava-yamahs can often be seen in this city during lunar eclipses and other significant celestial events. Legends among these mystery cults claim that yamahs sometimes accompany good spellcasters on crusades against otherworldly fiends, though every story inevitably ends with the yamah mysteriously departing after the deed is done, abandoning its mortal partner without a word.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Cold (Su) A creature touching a frost wight with natural weapons or unarmed strikes takes 1d6 cold damage. Create Spawn(Su) Any humanoid creature that is slain by a wight becomes a wight itself in only 1d4 rounds. Spawn so created are less powerful than typical wights, and suffer a -2 penalty on all d20 rolls and checks, as well as -2 hp per HD. Spawn are under the command of the wight that created them and remain enslaved until its death, at which point they lose their spawn penalties and become full-fledged and free-willed wights. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life. Resurrection Vulnerability (Su) A raise dead or similar spell cast on a wight destroys it (Will negates). Using the spell in this way does not require a material component.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Wights are humanoids who rise as undead due to necromancy, a violent death, or an extremely malevolent personality. In some cases, a wight arises when an evil undead spirit permanently bonds with a corpse, often the corpse of a slain warrior. They are barely recognizable to those who knew them in life; their flesh is twisted by evil and undeath, the eyes burn with hatred, and the teeth become beast-like. In some ways, a wight bridges the gap between a ghoul and a spectre-a warped animated corpse whose touch steals living energy.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Breath of Madness (Su) Black Magga can exhale a cloud of foul-smelling, poisonous breath as a standard action once every minute. This cloud of black smoke fills a 60-foot cone. All creatures in the area take 1d6 points of Wisdom damage and become confused for 1d6 rounds (a DC 27 Will save halves the Wisdom damage and negates the confusion effect). This is a mind-affecting poison effect. The save DC is Constitution-based. This breath weapon cannot be used while underwater. Transdimensional Tentacles (Su) Black Magga's tentacles allow her to see into and infiltrate the Ethereal Plane and the Plane of Shadow while she is on the Material Plane. This allows her not only to be aware of these planes and the creatures there, but also to shift her tentacles through these planes to attack their inhabitants. She can even phase her tentacles in and out of existence, effectively reaching through walls and other solid barriers to attack foes on the other side, provided that area is not warded by a dimensional lock or similar effect. She can grapple foes with her tentacles normally, but cannot pull grappled foes or objects through planes as her tentacles shift between them. Warp Dimensions (Su) Black Magga's presence distorts the dimensions. Any creature that attempts to utilize a teleportation effect while within 300 feet of Black Magga must succeed at a DC 21 caster level check or the teleport effect fails. If the effect fails, the creature that attempted to create that effect must succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Black Magga is one of the favored servants of Lamashtu and an embodiment of the goddess's reign over beasts, monsters, and madness. As an unholy auger of her will, Black Magga originally sought to confound the works of the civilized world, spread fear of monsters and the wilds, and direct Lamashtu's lesser servants in acts of depravity and bloodshed. Black Magga arrived in the Storval Deep not long after Karzoug flooded the immense quarry, and her presence in the newly formed lake brought much misery and dread to the Thassilonians who dwelt on the lake's shores or sailed its surface. Karzoug's interest in the region waned quickly, and he never bothered to take steps against the monster, prompting many to whisper that the runelord made a bargain with Lamashtu to place the monster in the Storval Deep, perhaps to hide some sort of great secret he had sunk beneath the waters. In any event, it was said that the goddess spoke directly to Black Magga, and for many, the words of the monster were equal to the commands of Lamashtu herself. Bearing a head like a plesiosaur atop a thrashing mass of tentacles and eyes, Black Magga is an immense creature indeed. Although she is effectively immortal until slain, she has spent many of the more than 10,000 years since she first came to Varisia in deep hibernation. These slumbers could last for a dozen centuries or more at a time, and are punctuated by relatively short periods of activity that generally last for only a few decades. These long periods of sleep have had something of a debilitating effect on Black Magga, for with each century of slumber, she grows weaker. She is now but a shadow of her original power. That she remains as powerful as she does today speaks volumes to the terrible wrath she must have possessed back during the height of Thassilon, before the advent of Earthfall changed everything. The Myth of Black Magga Fisherfolk and woodsmen who have ventured near the Storval Deep have long told tales of a fell monster rising from the depths. Below are a few commonly held but mistaken beliefs about Black Magga-although they may well have been true during the times of ancient Thassilon, when she was at the height of her power. BLOOD TONGUE: Many who have seen Black Magga and lived can never speak of their experiences. Supposedly, when they attempt to tell the tale, black blood wells from their throats and into their mouths, choking their words. Thus, far fewer claim to have seen Black Magga than actually have. GOD-PROOF: Black Magga is older than many gods. Divine magic is said to have little effect whatsoever on her abominable form. Anyone who cuts Magga's black heart from her vile chest and bathes in its putrescent blood will likewise become invulnerable to the power of the gods. STORM BRINGER: Sightings of Black Magga often herald powerful storms and hurricanes. It is said that the beast summons these storms to pull victims into her watery domain, whereupon she captures them, consumes them, and transforms them into monstrous, vermicular horrors. Mothers of Oblivion Lesser versions of Black Magga are said to dwell in deep lakes in other parts of the world. Known as Mothers of Oblivion, these creatures have the same basic statistics as Black Magga, except that they have only 10 Hit Dice and are Huge rather than Gargantuan. Monstrous creatures of chaos and madness, the abominable Mothers of Oblivion are said to have been created by the goddess of monsters to serve as mouthpieces and leaders among her savage minions. Some esoteric texts-sacrilegious even to Lamashtu's profane church-claim that the Mothers of Oblivion are actually sisters of Lamashtu, subjugated by the goddess, robbed of their divinity, and cast down to Golarion as her twisted servitors. Whatever their heritage, for uncounted centuries the Mothers of Oblivion have been among the favored servants of Lamashtu and throughout history have risen to mete out her unholy wrath. Rare in the extreme-and despite what the fearful mortal races call them-these monstrosities seem to have no ability to reproduce, though some whisper that a select few are capable of biting off their own tongues to produce strange, wormlike spawn. Mothers of Oblivion slink in the darkest, deepest reaches of the world, shunning the light of day as well as the gaze of insectlike mortals, who would gawk and abandon their pathetic minds at the merest glimpse of such unknowable horrors. The deepest reaches of oceans and the oldest lakes serve as redoubts for these forsaken queens of madness. From these depths, they sate themselves on sea creatures, the offerings of their servants, and the occasional unwary victim dragged screaming from the surface. They are careful to keep their presence secret from those of the world above. From the depths, Mothers of Oblivion form intricate hierarchies of servants and go-betweens, reaching their black tentacles through the societies of amphibious intermediaries into the demesnes of greater monstrosities and larger cities and civilizations alike.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Pallid Bond (Ex) A carrionstorm never initiates an attack on a creature that openly wears a symbol of Urgathoa or that is itself undead. If attacked first by such a creature, the carrionstorm's swarm attack deals only 1d3 points of damage to that creature rather than the usual 1d6 points. Vulnerable to Channeled Energy (Ex) A carrionstorm takes 150% as much damage as normal from channeled positive energy.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Where the dead walk, the carrion birds follow. In most cases, the unfortunate birds that feast on the remains of fallen undead creatures simply grow diseased and die. Yet the flesh of some ghouls has an altogether different effect upon such scavengers, and when they die of the poisoned repast, they do not stay dead for long. Alone, an undead crow or vulture is little more than a hideous mockery, but in rare cases where ghoulish activity is thick, entire colonies of carrion birds can succumb to undeath, retaining their flock mentality yet no longer seeking the flesh of the freshly dead to sate their hunger. Carrionstorms, as these flocks of undead birds are called, find brief respite from their morbid hunger only when their meals are warm and screaming. Carrionstorms are typically found near graveyards, haunted structures, or abandoned villages where ghouls have been active. Many necromancers and cultists of Urgathoa have a particular fondness for carrionstorms, and since the birds have a strange respect for the symbol of the Pallid Princess, rookeries of them are often found roosting in the nooks of the goddess of undeath's macabre cathedrals. Although the individual undead birds that make up a carrionstorm are little more intelligent than they were in life, as a whole, a carrionstorm forms a rudimentary hive mind that grants its members a slight bit more intellect than the typical bird. This not only allows the undead birds to utilize basic tactics, but allows rudimentary speech as well. Most carrionstorms understand a few dozen words in Necril, the language of the dead, and the sound of thousands of these undead carrion birds croaking out strange words can be truly unsettling to those who aren't prepared for the horror. This same hive mind allows necromancers to treat an entire carrionstorm as a single undead creature with regard to the effects of spells like command undead and control undead, or feats like Command Undead. The swarms make excellent scouts, and even better threats against small towns and superstitious communities.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Adamantine Bite (Ex) A forgefiend's bite attacks are treated as adamantine for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. Rend Armor (Ex) When a forgefiend hits with a bite attack, it chews any armor worn by the target-this grants the forgefiend a free sunder attempt against armor worn by the target if the victim fails a DC 22 Reflex save. A forgefiend also gains Greater Sunder and Improved Sunder as bonus feats. The save DC is Strength-based. Searing Spew (Su) A forgefiend can belch forth a searing pile of slag from its body maw as a standard action once every 1d4 rounds. This blob of molten metal affects any 10-foot-square area adjacent to the forgefiend. Any creature in this area takes 14d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 22 halves). The slag quickly cools, forming a rugged pile of worthless scrap and misshapen metal that is treated as difficult terrain-this stuff crumbles to powder in 1 hour. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Scanderigs, more commonly known as "forgefiends," look like large, heavily armored, barrel-shaped giants, with enormous mouths in their bellies in addition to the normal-sized ones in their heads. They are native to the Plane of Earth, but sometimes make their way through subterranean portals onto the Material Plane, where they gorge themselves on rich and relatively uncontested mineral veins. A forgefiend might live quite happily inside a mountain's heart for centuries, only causing trouble when the ore runs out or interlopers attempt to mine its territory. Forgefiends are particularly feared in many dwarven societies. In addition to their penchant for destroying deep forges, they are often portrayed as boogeyman-like figures for frightening dwarven children and instilling good smithing habits-for it is said, "For every scrap of slag you waste, a scanderig is making haste. Those who use excessive ore find forgefiends scratching at their door!"</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Devastating Bite (Ex) A hungerer's bite deals x4 damage on a successful critical hit. If this damage is enough to reduce a victim to negative hit points, the victim must succeed at a DC 30 Fortitude save to avoid being decapitated, bitten in half, or otherwise instantly killed by the horrific wound. The save DC is Strength-based. Vile Spew (Su) Whenever a hungerer takes damage, the resulting wound spews a great gout of vile blood and acid. Any creature adjacent to a hungerer when it is wounded takes 2d6 points of acid damage (Reflex DC 25 negates). The save DC is Constitution-based. Wisdom Drain (Su) A hungerer drains 2 points of Wisdom each time it strikes a foe with its bite or claw attacks. Unlike with other kinds of ability drain attacks, a hungerer does not heal any damage when it uses its Wisdom drain.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Once regular lamias, these hideously deformed creatures are the result of terrible fleshwarping experiments that have rarely been repeated since the fall of Thassilon. The heads and torsos of these creatures are nearly 10 feet in diameter, and a typical hungerer weighs about 20,000 pounds. Hungerers are unnatural creatures, re-released into the world with Karzoug's awakening. These terrors live in constant pain and serve as living embodiments of hunger, insatiable in their constant quests for sustenance. Although they prefer to tear and rend living flesh, hungerers can consume almost any organic material, and might even gnaw on stone or metal without ill effect when nothing else is available.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Catastrophic Shot (Ex) Whenever a kuchrima makes only a single attack in a round with a bow, it increases the critical threat range of that shot to 18-20. Disease (Ex) Bite-Filth Fever; save Fort DC 19; onset 1d3 days; frequency 1/day; effect 1d3 Dex damage and 1d3 Con damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. Oversized Weapon (Ex) A kuchrima can wield an oversized longbow in its talons while flying without incurring any penalty-this longbow can be one size category larger than normal (Large for most kuchrimas).</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>These foul creatures are a disgusting cross between humanoids and condors. Also known as the Eaters of the Dead, the kuchrimas are the lowest order of the lamia-kin, lacking even standard lamias' capability for spell-like abilities. They not only serve the function of common soldiers and scouts, but are also left to take care of the disposal of bodies, garbage, and other waste-most of which they feed upon. This habit results in their foul appearance and disease-ridden bite. Kuchrimas often wield giant bows in their powerful talons, holding the weapon in one talon and pulling the bowstring with the other in order to fire arrows with devastating effect. Kuchrimas have much in common with the condors they resemble, and are opportunistic hunters and scavengers. Bands of kuchrima hunters might fly dozens of miles from their communal aerie, using their keen sight to locate prey both small and large. In the extreme mountainous areas they inhabit, such meals often take the form of giant rams, mountain aurochs, and even the occasional mountaineer, though these disgusting creatures prefer their meals dead and rotting. Kuchrimas dwell principally in the thin air among the upper peaks of desolate mountain ranges, where they have gathered in enclaves or "gluttonies." They have lived in a state of static barbarism since the diaspora following the fall of the Thassilonian Empire. In the thousands of years since that civilization's collapse, these lamia-kin have migrated to many mountainous regions throughout Golarion. These disease-ridden hunters strive to remain well out of sight of land-bound races, which they mistrust and fear in numbers. Should a new runelord or powerful harridan come into power and manage to locate these disparate gluttonies, however, the kuchrimas could be gathered into a formidable airborne force once again.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Electricity Aura (Su) An old or older bronze dragon has an aura of electricity. All creatures within 5 feet take 1d6 points of electricity damage at the start of the dragon's turn. An ancient dragon's aura is 10 feet. A great wyrm's damage increases to 2d6. A bronze dragon can suppress this aura at will. Repulsion Breath (Su) Instead of a line of electricity, a bronze dragon can breathe a cone of repulsion gas. Targets must make a Will save or be compelled to do nothing but move away from the dragon for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per age category. This is a mind-affecting compulsion effect. Water Breathing (Ex) A bronze dragon breathes water and can use its breath weapon, spells, and abilities underwater. Wave Mastery (Su)For up to 10 minutes per age category per day, a juvenile bronze dragon, along with creatures or vessels within 50 feet, can move at twice its normal speed in water.</SpecialAbilities>

    <SpecialAbilities>Stasis (Su) Ifestus can merge with the earth, typically under a volcano or near a magma vent or tectonic plate, and go dormant for an indeterminate amount of time. The titan doesn't have to breathe, eat, or drink during this time. He is aware of his immediate surroundings out to the range of his telepathy during this time, and may communicate with creatures within the range of his telepathy. Ifestus can end his stasis at any time as a free action. Entering status is a standard action.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Ifestus found his way to Golarion thousands of years ago. He separates his time between catastrophic destruction and millennia-long slumbers in the molten bowels of the planet. A patient being, he uses his special ability to seek solitude in magma chambers, in massive volcanoes, and along the edges of grinding tectonic plates. It's rumored that many of Golarion's greatest earthquakes and volcanic eruptions were either facilitated by or witnessed by Ifestus. He was slumbering in a great volcano in Casmaron when Earthfall struck, and wandered the surface of the planet for a decade thereafter before finally settling into Mount Keeba. Quiet for thousands of years, Ifestus now rumbles and stirs.</Description>

    <Description_Visual>This monstrous clam's conjoined shells open wide enough to swallow a horse.

    <SpecialAbilities>Devastating Bite (Ex) A gigas clam's bite attack threatens a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. Poison (Ex) Siphon dart-injury; save Fort DC 24; frequency 1/ round for 6 rounds; effect 1d6 Str damage and paralysis; cure 2 consecutive saves. Siphon Dart (Ex) A gigas clam constantly rolls collected sediment and calcifications into needle-like darts it can eject through its siphons. A gigas clam can fire one of these darts as a standard action at a maximum range of 100 feet with no range increment, dealing an amount of damage equal to 2d6 plus its Strength modifier, and possibly poisoning the target. Siphon Jet (Ex) As a full-round action, a gigas clam can use its powerful siphon to move a creature or object at least one size smaller up to 20 feet directly away from itself or directly toward itself in a straight line. A creature trapped in this stream of water can avoid the push or pull with a DC 22 Reflex save. A gigas clam can also use this jet to propel itself up to five times its swim speed in a straight line, and can use its trample attack in conjunction with this increased movement. If at any point during this movement the gigas clam comes in contact with a solid object (such as a ship's hull), it deals 4d8 points of damage as it rams the object with its durable shell. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Commonly found only in shallow beds of sediment on the ocean floor, the gigas clam is an unusual foe-one that often catches divers and sailors unaware when they mistake it for merely an oversized mollusk. Shining, misshapen barnacles cover a gigas clam's tough and distinctive shell, glittering nodes that attract curious fish toward the beast's side. Even larger predator fish such as marlins, tuna, and sharks can find themselves in the tightly clasped jaws of a gigas clam. Gigas clams are primarily sedentary monsters, content to lie in wait as prey inevitably wanders toward their seemingly harmless forms. Vast fields of the titanic bivalves can be found scattered along the ocean floor of the Inner Sea, feeding on fish and any debris that falls to the bottom, including shipwreck victims and castaways thrown overboard by pirates. If no food presents itself for some time, a bed of gigas clams either relocates or crawls toward land in search of a more dependable source of food. Gigas clams depart from their mostly passive hunting style once per year, when the bulging summer moon is at its fullest. Entire beds of the creatures propel themselves upward and burst through the surface of the water, attacking passing ships as well as coastal communities. During these times, gigas clams seek out their most favored prey: air-breathing humanoids. Using their powerful siphons to slam into passing merchant vessels and war galleons, the massive clams are indiscriminate in their search for humanoid flesh. Though they are normally hasty and seldom use tactics to obtain their prey, occasionally a lone gigas clam uses its feminine figure to trick unsuspecting ships into gigas clam-infested waters. The clam and its kin ruthlessly ram the vessel until its contents spill into the open water. Once trapped inside a gigas clam's quivering and contracting musculature, victims are almost certainly doomed, as the clam's acidic innards swiftly melt and destroy anything within. When engaged in melee, a gigas clam can strike with both its fleshy siphons as well as its terrible foot, which terminates in a toothy maw that can deliver devastating wounds. Since gigas clams openly attack land-dwellers only during 1 month out of the year, coastal communities and fisherfolk dwelling near gigas clam beds know to prepare their ships and docks for the deadly onslaughts of these creatures. But even the most formidable defenses are not enough to hold back great numbers of the clams, and most find it easier to simply avoid settling near gigas clam fields. Particularly bold monster hunters and sages travel throughout the Inner Sea during the summer in hopes of spotting the slimy beasts, using elaborate charts and maps listing past reports of the creatures to pick which areas to observe. A few whisper tales of immense magical pearls buried within the clams, which they postulate are responsible for the clams' increased size and intelligence. Others propose that the monsters absorb a portion of their victims' intelligence and memories while digesting them. Infamous Deeds Primarily encountered in the shallow depths of the Inner Sea and off the coast of western Garund, gigas clams leave a trail of destruction during their annual rampages, and have committed numerous deeds that prove them worthy of their notoriety. Humanoids living beneath the waves fear gigas clams as well-a field of the creatures destroyed the merfolk town of Selsurisa west of Absalom 10 years ago. The settlement had fought off the ravenous clams in years past, but the attack that devastated it was odd in that it took place during the region's cold season. The merfolk were thus unprepared when the beasts amassed and overran the town in a matter of hours. As the clams destroyed the town's sculpted caves and elegant spires, the merfolk sent waves of soldiers and giant crab companions to fight back, but their hasty defenses were no match for the sheer ferocity of the gigas clams. The merfolk have since relocated to other settlements around the Isle of Kortos, but have not forgotten the day of the attack, which many claim was inspired by fiendish sorcery not normally available to the gigas clams. Many of the merfolk still yearn to reclaim their overrun settlement, whose ruined towers and rubble-choked caves now serve as the breeding grounds for the brutal beings. In the early days of Bloodcove's founding, gigas clams found their way deep into the Fever Sea and settled in the Vanji River delta, where they feed on the plentiful fish and other sea creatures that travel downstream with the river's current. The mammoth clams posed a great threat to the fledgling Bloodcove's fragile trade and commerce, since few ships dared sail near the shallow delta in fear of surprise attacks by the unpredictable creatures. The pirates of the then-small port banded together and eventually defeated the beasts, but were unable to kill all of them. Some residents still worry that the clams might organize a retributive assault. Adventure Hooks Gigas clams tend to remain passive during the cooler months, but those who venture too close to their homes during the wrong season might run afoul of the giant mollusks. • A trio of scavenger ships recently returned from looting Azlanti ruins only to meet their fate at the hands of a gigas clam, which smashed the ships to pieces and littered their treasures all over the sea floor below. Only the captain and two sailors survived the ordeal; the captain wants to return and claim what's his, while his two crew members want to have nothing to do with the sea for a long while. • In response to sightings of a gigas clam breaching the water this past summer near Corentyn, the Chelish Navy issued notice of a substantial bounty on the strange beasts. Several folk plan to set sail to hunt the creature. One ship in particular is crewed entirely by tengus, who keep a mysterious contraption covered with oiled canvas on their ship's deck and guard it day and night.</Description>

    <Description>South of Jalmeray, deep in the Yogisa Trench in the middle of the Obari Ocean, the terrifying gutaki known as Ugash-Iram lords over the underwater city of Achom. Ugash-Iram and its lesser kin practice foul rites and perform horrible rituals to honor their patron deity, Dagon, amid the city's strange and twisted spires, which rise out of a dark fissure in the seabed like claws climbing toward the surface. Crackling eruptions of magical energy brief ly illuminate the city in flashes of light, but it is otherwise as dark and lightless as the souls of its foul inhabitants. Because of its isolation in the deepest waters of the Obari Ocean, few surface-dwellers know of Ugash- Iram's existence, though those fisherfolk and sailors who've heard tales of the mighty being know to fear it. Locathah sages place the indomitable gutaki's age at over 3,000 years old, and dwellers in the underwater regions surrounding Achom have long loathed and feared Ugash-Iram, whose legions of devotees have spelled the ruin of countless aquatic cities. Ugash-Iram itself is responsible for destroying a dozen massive underwater cities in the past millennium, and the scattered ruins that lie around the Yogisa Trench serve as testament to its power. Those aquatic creatures Ugash-Iram doesn't outright annihilate are captured and integrated into Achom either as members of the slave caste or as converted devotees to Dagon. Entire tribes of sahuagin, adaros, and iku-tursos have united under the banner of Ugash-Iram and its gutaki kin in Achom, and the underwater metropolis bulges at the borders with the thousands of evil inhabitants who make their home there. These inhabitants raid for Ugash-Iram and populate its city, protecting Achom and performing all kinds of menial tasks for their overlord. With these minions, Ugash-Iram's deadly reach extends all the way to the surface of the Obari Ocean and even the nearby shores of Geb, Jalmeray, and Qadira. Isolated in its flooded metropolis beneath the sea, Ugash-Iram has plenty of resources, a generous life span, and thousands of minions at its disposal, making it a formidable foe for any who would seek to stop the despotic gutaki before its inf luence spreads even further. Infamous Deeds The legends of Ugash-Iram remain shrouded in mystery, since few aquatic humanoids have seen the monster, and fewer still have lived to tell the tale. Some claim that the gutaki gained its power by devouring other gutaki, gaining greater power and its array of 12 tentacles. One especially strange tale claims Ugash-Iram once captured a great kraken and imprisoned it deep in the gaping Yogisa Trench. Ugash-Iram is said to keep the behemoth perpetually on the brink of death-the gutaki and its minions carefully torture the kraken and subject it to grotesque experiments and disfiguring transformations. Just as gutaki were supposedly born when Dagon defeated the great kraken Kaktora, Ugash-Iram hopes that by subjecting its captured kraken to cruel experiments, it can create its own race of 12-tentacled followers. While ships crossing the middle of the Obari Ocean face all manner of risks, perhaps the worst is capture by Ugash-Iram's minions. Records tell of a combined effort by Ugash-Iram's adaro and sahuagin soldiers to capture a diplomatic fleet from Vudra some years ago. A dozen lucky sailors perished during the raid; the aquatic horrors captured everyone else, smearing them with a magical jelly that allowed them to breathe underwater and dragging them to Achom for torture, experimentation, and eventual sacrifice to their lord Dagon. Adventure Hooks Tracking Ugash-Iram down is not a task for the faint of heart, and those who do manage to find the vile underwater metropolis of Achom would do well to stay away. Despite the danger, adventurers might find any number of reasons to explore the foul settlement and face its cruel inhabitants. • A tribe of adaro aligned with Ugash-Iram of Achom threatens Vudrani vessels bound for Jalmeray. At risk of losing their precious cargo, merchants send word to ports along the Obari Ocean's shores, searching for a group to deal with the adaro threat and determine their true motives. • Tired of living in fear of Ugash-Iram, locathah, merfolk, cecaelias, and other non-evil aquatic creatures recently formed a congress to address the gutaki's tyranny. Legends tell of a magical device of unknown origin lost within the Obari Ocean south of Stonespire Island. Thought to be capable of blocking out mental domination-among other powers-this device would prove a great weapon in the fight against Ugash-Iram and the other denizens of Achom. The aquatic council has put out a great bounty for retrieval of the item.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Miasmic Breath (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds, an addu can exhale a 30-foot cone of poisonous breath. Creatures caught in the area must make a successful DC 25 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Constitution damage. This is a poison effect and the save DC is Constitution-based. Rip Current (Su) An addu can stir the water in such a way that it creates powerful currents in its immediate area. As a move action, an addu can either push creatures and objects up to 30 feet away from it or draw creatures and objects within 30 feet toward it. Creatures and objects caught in the rip current can resist being moved with a successful DC 25 Reflex save. This ability can only be used in the water, and the save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>As enigmatic as they are dangerous, addus hail from the most hellish corners of Golarion's deepest seas. Addu encounters are thankfully rare, but those who have faced one and survived tell tales of the beasts' unimaginable powers. As a result, merchant and pirate lookouts alike carefully watch the watery horizons for jagged, fiery-hued spines, which have come to signal seafarers' imminent doom. The colors of the tropical deep-simmering reds, yellows, and oranges-decorate addus' long, serpentine bodies. In addition to the ominous fins on their backs, smaller spines jut from addus' snouts, heads, and necks. Their short but powerful forearms can strip flesh from bone, especially when the beasts employ them alongside their barge-sized jaws, which bear teeth the length of daggers. With long tails that can sweep from the water with whiplike velocity, addus can reach up to 50 feet long and weigh up to 14,000 pounds. Ecology Legends claim that when Golarion was young, fissures in its deepest seaf loors began spewing noxious gases left over from the planet's formation. These geysers helped provide life-giving heat to the equatorial oceans, but also rendered small pockets of deep-sea waters uninhabitable. Golarion's thriving aquatic ecosystem pushed back, however, and from these poisonous environs emerged the hardy addus. The geysers nurtured and strengthened these enormous, tropically colored creatures, instilling in them a mindless cruelty and a voracious hunger for raw meat. Legends maintain early addus trolled the edges of their toxic haunts, harnessing the power of rip currents to kill any prey lurking within the tolerable waters beyond. Eventually, addus evolved to embrace the poison native to their homes, and even to expel it as a weapon, bringing instant death to any creature unlucky enough to inhale it. Experts are unsure just how the addus developed their hunting techniques-whether magically or through a fluke of nature-but all agree that nothing known to modern scholarship explains their deadly abilities. In time, the deep-sea creatures developed heightened instincts that kept them far away from the telltale haze of addus' watery lairs. It was then that hunger drove the beasts to establish hunting grounds in shallower waters. Their natural maliciousness led addus to fight among themselves until each survivor had enough space to roam and feed alone. Scholars believe that every few weeks, addus experience a blinding hunger that prompts them to turn the seas red with the blood of their meals, which often consist of hundreds of pounds of raw, still-twitching meat. Addus are known to feed on whales, giant squid, dire sharks and-when other prey is scarce-sea serpents. Tales of epic battles between addus and sea serpents exist among many seafaring nations, scaring children and serving as a warning to sailors. Even more terrifying, however, are rumors that claim addus periodically crave humanoid flesh, and will capsize ships as large as their own bodies to obtain just a few bites of this succulent treat. Scholars debate whether addus hunt ships or rather attack them by mistake, confusing the vessels' shadows with those of surfacing whales. Regardless, addus pose a major threat to any vessel that frequents the vast stretches of open water where these beasts tend to stake their claims. Habitat &amp; Society Owing to their violent natures, addus are nearly always found alone. They are said to be most concentrated in Golarion's southern seas, where legends allege ancient, noxious underwater geysers once were plentiful. A particularly unsettling tale speaks of an area several hundred miles west of the Shackles archipelago where addus' hunting grounds perfectly abut one another like a deadly, invisible puzzle. Although an addu that intrudes on another's hunting grounds can most certainly expect to battle its fellow beast to the death, some pirate legends maintain that these creatures occasionally cooperate-when it suits them. For example, an Ollo-based pirate captain once claimed that after happening upon a vicious battle between two addus, his vessel came under attack when the beasts spotted his ship's sails. Once the pirates outran them, the addus turned on each other again, intent on settling their original quarrel. But given that survivors of addu attacks speak of the speed with which the creatures dispatch their targets, most old salts conclude the captain invented a compelling but ultimately fictitious tale. It's believed that no one has yet survived a battle involving more than one addu. Scholars believe that female addus typically patrol hunting grounds measuring only a few square miles, while male members of the species are more nomadic, often moving on to new territories every few weeks. This may explain the beasts' reproductive practices. Aquatic elves report that up to five times during the creatures' fertile years, female addus deposit groups of six to eight eggs at the edge of their hunting grounds. The eggs secrete the noxious fumes that lend addus their infamy, attracting any nearby males, which then fertilize them. Addlets (as their young are called) appear to be born into a state of frenzy, immediately initiating brawls among their siblings. As is fitting for such vicious creatures, only the strongest addlet of a litter survives to seek its own hunting grounds and wreak havoc on its own victims. Despite their violent tendencies, addus appear to be long-lived creatures. Native tales speak of single addus that have terrorized the same waters for up to 6 centuries. These stories say the longer addus live, the more they crave humanoid flesh-or the more they crave maritime battle, depending on the variety of the tale. Either way, some of these stories describe addus, wizened through millennia of survival, capsizing ships before their unfortunate crew members ever realize they're being targeted. Then, the tales claim, the ancient addus pluck their victims from the sea, stripping the flesh from their bones one by one and offering no mercy save the final rest of death.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Drown (Su) As a full-round action, a drowning devil can summon murky water into the lungs of a single target within 30 feet. If the target cannot breathe water, it cannot hold its breath and immediately begins to drown. At the start of its next turn, the target must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude save to cough up this water; otherwise, it falls unconscious at 0 hit points. On the next round, the target must save successfully again or drop to -1 hit point and be dying; on the third round it must save successfully again or die. The save DC is Charisma-based. Heavy Aura (Su) Whenever a creature enters the drowning devil's heavy aura, it must succeed at a DC 18 Will save or reduce its speed as if carrying a load one step higher or wearing armor one category heavier (whichever is worse), and the creature's armor check penalty increases by 2. A creature already carrying a heavy load or wearing heavy armor that fails its save cannot move as long as it remains in the affected area. A creature that successfully saves against a drowning devil's heavy aura is immune to that devil's aura for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based. Poison (Ex) Slam-injury; save Fort DC 20; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Str; cure 2 consecutive saves.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Few creatures among the hosts of Hell have as horrific a visage as a drowning devil-called a sarglagon in its own Infernal tongue. Four unblinking orange eyes stare out of its vaguely piscine head, flanked by a pair of curving ram's horns and located above a wide mouth of countless jagged teeth. Where one would expect hands or even claws, a drowning devil instead has fists of writhing, stinging tentacles, as though the infernal creature bore a pair of sea anemones as poisonous cudgels. A pair of finlike wings sprouts from the beast's shoulders, wafting like seaweed at their frayed ends. Below the waist, a drowning devil resembles a long, serpentine fish, with a fluked tail and a ridge of spines running down its back. Drowning devils take great pride in being the best-adapted guardians of Hell's waterways, and are among the few fiends who travel the seas and rivers of the multiverse as part of larger infernal plots. Though a drowning devil can function perfectly well on dry land or even in the air, it is truly a force to be reckoned with within its natural aquatic environment. In any environment, a drowning devil moves with a haunting litheness as though it were swimming through the air or across the ground. The typical drowning devil weighs 600 pounds, and when stretched to full length, can surpass 15 feet from head to tail. Ecology Most sarglagons come into being when petitioners of Hell exhibit particular skill or passion for keeping secrets, guarding passageways, and protecting against incursions. Drowning devils are vigilant guardians whose versatility in all environments makes them ideal sentinels, especially over Hell's waterways. From the swamps of Stygia to the River Styx, intruders often use Hell's aqueous channels to encroach upon Hell's borders from other planes, and cowardly souls flee to these waterways in the hope of finding a route to escape their eternal torment. Thus, those lower-ranking devils who please the masters of Hell by guarding the secrets and captives that power the plane and its denizens are sometimes transformed into sarglagons, granting them better tools with which to ensure the safety and seclusion of their charges. Habitat &amp; Society From the fetid swamps of Stygia, the fifth layer of Hell, rise the Academies of Lies, where the archdevil Geryon and his minions hoard secrets, lies, and valuable knowledge with which they can manipulate weaker souls throughout the planes, bringing untold numbers to the ranks of Hell. But while the osyluths actively seek these secrets and lies to swell their library-temples, drowning devils serve as the guardians of the mires that surround them, ensuring unwelcome eyes do not gaze upon the secrets that ensure Hell's dominance, and preventing oaths held tight by their masters from slipping out of the devils' grasps. Drowning devils not only serve as sentinels of Hell, but are often called by diabolists and conjurers on the Material Plane to serve as guardians of their infernal lairs, hidden treasures, or personal secrets. Gaining a sarglagon's service often comes at a high price, for a drowning devil is not likely to simply stand watch when given access to an item so valuable that it requires a fiendish guardian. Rather, the contracts required to bind them to their task typically come with strict terms defining how long the devil will serve as protector, what access it can have to that which it guards, and what portion of its charge it may claim when its service is finished. Those who wish to bind a drowning devil or call one as a planar ally find better success when the secret or treasured prize they wish the sarglagon to protect is more valuable, more damning, or ultimately more attractive to the devil, as the temptation of guarding something it can later use for its own benefit can motivate a drowning devil to bargain more flexibly, lest it risk losing access to such a prize for being too stubborn or demanding. Even then, mortals must be as vigilant as their devil servitors in order to ensure that the sarglagons are not exploiting some oversight in their negotiations. Some on the Material Plane find themselves the wards of drowning devils without personally entering into an agreement with a sarglagon. This is especially common in cases where the taint of infernal blood runs through a human's veins, or more often when a human births a tief ling child. In these instances, the devils related to the mortals contract the sarglagons to act as their proxies upon the Material Plane-agents tasked with ensuring the safety of the devils' humanoid kin. Whether the devil progenitors do this to keep their mortal offspring safe for their own far-reaching plans or out of some sense of loyalty depends on the particular instance, but for those under the care of a drowning devil, the motivations rarely matter. A sarglagon's vigilance is stif ling to one hoping to live a life of free choices and privacy, and often the greatest threat to drowning devil's charges is the charges themselves, as many see suicide as the only way to escape the constant gaze of their eerie diabolic guardian.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Blind (Ex) A faceless whale sees and senses exclusively through its blindsight ability, which is based on sound and movement-beyond 150 feet, the whale is considered blind. A deafened faceless whale is effectively blinded as well. It is invulnerable to all sight-based effects and attacks, including gaze attacks. Resonant Song (Su) As a standard action, a faceless whale can focus a 60-foot ray of sonic energy on a single target that deals 8d6 points of damage. This ray deals normal damage to objects, but is still subject to hardness. Alternatively, a faceless whale can blast this resonant energy in a 60- foot cone. Creatures in this area must succeed at a DC 28 Fortitude or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. Any submerged creature holding its breath must succeed at a second Fortitude saving throw at the same DC or it has its breath knocked out of it and instantly begins drowning.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Called "ansiktsloshvals" in Aklo, and sometimes called "Darklands whales," faceless whales are enigmatic predators of the Sightless Sea rarely encountered elsewhere on Golarion. Like cavefish, faceless whales lost their eyes and pigmentation from countless generations spent living and breeding in the lightless depths. The lack of pigmentation leaves the creatures' skin little more than a transparent, blubber-lined film, with pulsing veins and churning organs visible beneath the silvery membrane. Sailors' lore from the Sightless Sea claims a faceless whale's most recent meal shows through the taut skin of its belly. It is unknown precisely how long faceless whales have inhabited the Sightless Sea. Some legends claim faceless whales began their lives as normal toothed whales that washed into the Darklands during the cataclysm of Earthfall, if not long before. Darker tales contend the faceless whales were driven into the realm of Orv by a coven of powerful sea hags, who robbed the faceless whales of their sight when they refused to teach the hags their potent song. An adult faceless whale is 70 feet long and weights 90,000 pounds, though some specimens stretch these averages and grow half again as large. Ecology Faceless whales resemble the toothed whales common to the Arcadian Ocean in body structure, possessing a tapered mouth lined with stubby, conical teeth and a streamlined body. Lacking eyes, faceless whales depend totally upon their keen blindsight to navigate, seek prey, and avoid the predations of the Sightless Sea's most horrific inhabitants. Faceless whales prefer to hunt near the bottom of the Sightless Sea, where crushing pressures and freezing temperatures nurture large, sluggish organisms with few places to hide, and where the whales find safety from other menacing predators. Because of the unusual and outright alien composition of the creatures found within the lowest depths, faceless whales developed indiscriminate appetites. A hungry faceless whale consumes virtually any living thing it can gulp into its jaws, including the plentiful aquatic aberrations. Faceless whales can remain submerged for hours at a time, diving to depths of over 7,000 feet. Faceless whales that survive to adulthood in the harsh conditions of Orv live 80 years or longer. As predators that spend the majority of their lives in the deepest waters, Darklands whales are rarely spotted. Those who sail upon the dark currents of the Sightless Sea and Lake Nirthran see these beasts only when the whales surface to breathe. When surfacing, a faceless whale breathes for minutes at a time, exhaling and inhaling massive volumes of air in great misty spouts. When a faceless whale finds prey it can easily outswim, it plunges downward with its mouth agape, snapping up the morsel before it can react. When pursuing larger or faster prey, the faceless whale becomes a persistence hunter, hounding its quarry at a deceptively leisurely pace. After what often proves to be days of dogged pursuit, the whale's prey becomes too exhausted to swim further. Before the quarry can marshal the last of its strength to defend itself, the faceless whale renders it helpless with a resonant song. When the faceless whale is not in combat, it uses this sonic attack to break through rock and gain access to new hunting grounds within Orv and beyond. Habitat &amp; Society Faceless whales typically hunt and swim alone, except when prey is abundant. When hunting is favorable, faceless whales organize into pods led by the oldest (and typically largest) female. Pods are short lived, often forming only a handful of times within a faceless whale's lifetime. As such, males compete fiercely for breeding rights during these gatherings. Pods last only as long as prey sustains them. Once food becomes scarce, the pod disperses into the Sightless Sea, and individual whales brave the chill waters alone in search of richer hunting grounds. Mated pairs of faceless whales remain together only long enough to raise their first calf. This period of nurturing typically lasts no longer than 5 years-just enough time for the parents to teach a calf basic hunting strategies and witness its first unassisted kill. Afterward, the parents part ways, leaving the calf to mature to adulthood or perish in the uncertain depths of the abyss. A faceless whale spends the majority of its life in isolation, plumbing the depths of the Sightless Sea in search of prey, the occasional mate, and hunting grounds rich enough to support a temporary pod. When it makes such a discovery, a faceless whale circles the boundary of the new territory, calling out to its fellows with a groaning, dirge-like song that carries for leagues. Whalers who ply their trade upon the Sightless Sea listen for this dirge with fanatical obsession. Faceless whales provide numerous alchemical ingredients, and their bones and teeth make excellent weapons and armor. An adult faceless whale possesses enough of both to make a crew of whalers rich, provided they have the courage and skill to slay the creature. Though faceless whales prefer larger meals, they eagerly prey upon humanoids when other food is scarce. A sailor fallen overboard makes an easy snack for an adult or a full meal for a juvenile. Conventional wisdom claims that faceless whales consider seagoing vessels indigestible, but serpentfolk hiss tales of faceless whales of exceptional cunning that capsize or fracture ships and feast upon the drowning crews, plucking them from among the flotsam. On rare occasion, a faceless whale finds its way into the oceans of Golarion. Some believe the creatures possess an instinctive knowledge of hidden waterways linking the Sightless Sea to the world above (perhaps all that remains of the migratory instincts that once drove their cetacean ancestors). Those few faceless whales that venture beyond the Darklands typically do so only brief ly, breaching the surface on moonless nights just long enough to take in a breath of air free from the fetid staleness of Orv. Many sages postulate that the Sightless Sea is bottomless, its deepest trenches connecting to planes of primordial darkness where the pressure is capable of crushing living beings into stone. It is possible that the Sightless Sea is just one of many faceless whale hunting grounds. If this is the case, there is no telling what a faceless whale might bring up from the ebon depths.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Boiling Seas (Ex) Once per minute, a gargiya can concentrate the heat within its body, causing seawater in a 20-foot radius to boil for 1d6 rounds. All creatures caught in this boiling seawater take 4d8 points of fire damage. Creatures spending 2 or more consecutive rounds subjected to this damage must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or fall unconscious. The save DC is Constitution-based. Dying Gasp (Su) When a gargiya is killed, it disgorges from its gullet the molten boulder that heats its body. Its fiery death throes deal 6d6 points of fire damage to all creatures within a 20-foot-radius burst. A DC 22 Reflex save halves this damage. The save DC is Constitution-based. Scalding Scales (Ex) A gargiya generates such intense heat that anything touching it takes 2d6 points of fire damage. Creatures striking a gargiya with natural attacks or unarmed strikes are subject to this damage. Any metal weapon striking a gargiya must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or melt, gaining the broken condition. A metal weapon that fails a second save is destroyed. Wooden weapons are destroyed after only one failed save. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Crueler and more volatile than their sea-serpent cousins, gargiyas gravitate toward and sustain themselves on seismic hotspots. Far from being a danger to the beasts, these bubbling crevices spew a form of magma that imbues gargiyas with incredible abilities. From birth, gargiyas ingest magma bubbling up from the ocean floor. By the time they've reached maturity, the monsters develop a molten core in their gullets that allows them to call forth scalding heat at will. Gargiyas' aggressive tendencies toward seafarers have garnered them a well-earned nickname-"boiler beasts." Gargiyas' affinity for all things volcanic has left a pattern of stippled crimson on their massive, snake-like bodies. The spiny frills jutting from their heads and necks resemble enormous, iron-forged blades, and hundreds of stubby appendages line the sides of their underbellies, wriggling ominously when the beasts rear from the sea. Of all the gargiyas' features, though, perhaps the most intimidating are their eyes and maws, which seethe with the light and heat of burning coals-particularly when the beasts are aggravated. Capable of slithering through water like an enormous python, a gargiya stretches 30 feet in length and weighs up to 5 tons. Ecology Legends of the seas say that early in gargiyas' existence, as the ocean floor around them shuddered and stretched, the warmth of the seas' burgeoning volcanoes fascinated the beasts. To the gargiyas, these seismic regions offered a siren call of safety, isolation and-unbeknownst to the animalistic creatures-power. While it's unclear just how it lends gargiyas such power, scholars agree that this magma serves as gargiyas' primary sustenance and as the source of their hyperthermal abilities. Scholars believe that as gargiyas became more adept at manipulating heat, they became more protective of the magma vents they call home. Whereas early legends speak of gargiyas that rarely surfaced, preferring to stay close to their volcanic lairs, modern stories tell of gargiyas that see any sentient creatures-even if they're sailing a mile away-as threats to be met head-on. The few sailors who have survived these encounters warn of gargiyas that actively patrol the waters surrounding their magma vents, surfacing at even the slightest sign of unlucky passersby. Apparently, to the gargiyas, any who venture near their precious lairs must covet them. Because of gargiyas' aggressiveness, a small subset of oceanic cartographers has devoted itself to recording the locations of their known lairs. These maps, available in many southern ports' markets, are popular among traders and pirates who wish to skirt fiery confrontation. However, in testament to the cutthroat competition between many port merchants, it's not unheard of for these maps to contain "mistakes"-oversights built into the guides by their previous owners, hoping to lure rivals to horrific doom, or protect favored shipping lanes. Despite gargiyas' destructive reputations, some Golarion cultures revere their molten cores as a symbol of status and wealth. Taldans, in particular, are drawn to the cores' seductively mysterious glow. The richest Taldan patriarchs often believe owning such a rare treasure-and showing it off, of course-is a worthy life goal. Careless of the risks gargiya hunts entail, these patriarchs sometimes sponsor teams of adventurers to quest for these cores. Most of these expeditions end in bloody and burning tragedy, but to some hardy sea-goers, the potential rewards of glory and riches are too alluring to resist. Habitat &amp; Society Gargiyas mostly live alone near major archipelagos with abundant volcanic activity. They are most numerous in the isolated waters surrounding the Shackles, though scattered sightings have been reported throughout Golarion's warmer seas. There is a significant concentration of gargiyas near the Smoker where magma seeps up from the sea floor, and also talk of a stretch north of Shark Island where gargiya lairs speckle the ocean floor by the dozens. No one knows, however, whether this latter story is true or rather was concocted to deter authorities from the hideouts of buccaneers who roamed the islands before the sahuagin staked their claim there. Gargiyas do not typically share their homes with others of their kind. However, sailors have told stories of defeating a gargiya after a long and brutal struggle only to come face to face with another one-ostensibly coming to its kin's aid. The question of whether these tales are simple exaggerations or evidence of gargiya collaboration has prompted many a fistfight in portside taverns. How well these braggarts fare in such brawls often indicates whether they're capable of the outlandish adventures they so boldly claim. Although tales of collaborating gargiyas are unsettling enough, even more sinister rumors have surfaced from seafarers who dare to brave the Eye of Abendego. There, the tales say, the turbulent seas beneath Golarion's permanent hurricane hide groups of gargiyas whipped into a frenzy by the tempest that followed Aroden's death a century ago. According to legend, these gargiyas roam the entire area of the Eye as predators, ambushing ships and boiling their crews in the ocean's salty waters. It is said that they decorate their volcanic lairs with their victims' bones, hinting that gargiyas possess an intelligence beyond that of mere animals. Unlike many reptilian creatures, gargiyas birth their young live. Scholars agree that, typically, male and female gargiyas come together to breed every decade or so. Afterward, the beasts abandon each other. When the female returns to her lair, she is thought to consume large amounts of magma while her single snakeling gestates, usually for a period of about 10 years. When giving birth, the gargiya expels her offspring into a magma-spewing fissure, where it grows and gathers strength until it leaves to find its own home. Although there is some debate about gargiyas' longevity, scholars believe they typically live around 300 years. Rumors, however, speak of gargiyas that have lived much longer-perhaps even predating modern civilization-but if any have encountered such an ancient terror and survived, they have never surfaced to tell the tale.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Poison (Ex) Tentacle-injury; save Fort DC 25; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d4 Str; cure 2 consecutive saves. Murmur (Su) A lorelei's murmur has the power to infect the minds of those that hear it, calling them to the its side. This effect even has the ability to influence undead creatures despite their usual immunity to mind-affecting effects. When a lorelei murmurs, all creatures aside from other lorelei within a 300-foot spread must succeed on a DC 20 Will saving throw or become captivated. A creature that successfully saves is not subject to the same lorelei's song for 24 hours. A victim under the effects of the murmur moves toward the lorelei using the most direct means available. If the path leads them into a dangerous area such as through fire or off a cliff, that creature receives a second saving throw to end the effect before moving into peril. Affected creatures can take no actions other than to defend themselves. A victim within 5 feet of the lorelei simply stands and offers no resistance to the its attacks. This effect continues for as long as the lorelei murmurs and for 1 round thereafter. This is a sonic mind-affecting charm effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. Vortex (Su) A lorelei can create a whirlpool as a standard action, at will. This ability functions identically to the whirlwind special attack (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 306), but can form only underwater and cannot leave the water. A creature must succeed at a DC 25 Reflex save or be snared by the churning waters. The vortex is 20 feet across and 80 feet deep, and deals 2d8+9 points of damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>A lorelei resembles an enormous, stony sea anemone with a humanlike face covering much of its body. Noted for its ability to produce magical murmurs that entrance sailors navigating close to its lair, a lorelei is a magnet for destruction. The creatures lurk near rocky outcroppings and protuberances, barely concealed by crashing waves or rushing rivers, eager to lure humanoids to their deaths. Also known as a "murmuring stone" for its rocklike natural camouf lage, a lorelei is a solitary creature that shuns peaceful contact with other living things. It broods in the shadows of seaside cliffs and ocean trenches, emerging only to torment the living. When not pursuing more complicated schemes, a lorelei is fond of wrecking ships on nearby rocks and luring sailors beneath the surface to drown. Some claim these creature were once a species of beautiful fey cursed by foul forces. This claim is backed by the fact that they behave much like nereids, nixies, and sirens. A lorelei stands 9 feet tall, not counting the tentacles atop its body, and weighs around 2,000 pounds. Ecology A lorelei's body is barrel-shaped, with a foot known as a basal disk at the bottom. A lorelei's basal disk is less adhesive than that of a sea anemone but more flexible, allowing the lorelei to climb at a reasonable pace, and to swim by undulating its underside. At the top end of the lorelei's body, dozens of tentacles surround a toothless maw that it uses to ingest food. In addition to these strange features, the lorelei has a humanlike face that covers much of its body on one side. The mouth on the lorelei's face cannot consume food-it exists only to produce speech and other sounds. In contrast, a lorelei's eyes are fully functional. The lorelei has no ears, but can sense sound with its entire body, having a range of hearing comparable to that of an average human. A lorelei's brain is located behind its face, protected by a plate of cartilage. That hard plate is the only part of a lorelei's body that isn't yielding and rubbery. A lorelei's hide is difficult to crush and cut, serving as surprisingly effective natural armor. This skin is also camouf laged with a rocklike appearance. A lorelei can retract its tentacles to take on the appearance of a boulder, allowing it to remain hidden until its prey is too close to escape. True to their rarity and solitary nature, loreleis reproduce asexually. Every few decades, a lorelei can produce another of its kind by splitting off a single piece of its body, which then grows into a young lorelei. Offspring produced in this manner inherit portions of their parent's memories, giving them fully functioning adult minds without any need for instruction or socialization. Habitat &amp; Society A lorelei prefers a lonesome and solitary existence, shunning its own kind as readily as it shuns all living things. Brooding and morose, loreleis enjoy only one thing: making other, happier creatures suffer. Loreleis regularly orchestrate conf licts, shipwrecks, and other disasters to celebrate the cruel hand of fate that rules the nihilistic world they see everywhere they look. Since it rarely wanders far from its rocky lair, a lorelei sits in wait, sometimes for weeks, hoping for a victim to come within range of its murmured song. Though it will fight to keep its lair, a lorelei dislikes prolonged conf lict and abandons its rocky outcroppings or underwater caves if the location receives too much visitation or attention. Sometimes a lorelei maintains two or three lairs in order to move between them regularly, thus attracting less attention to each location.</Description>

    <Description>The mighty kronosaurus is a relentless hunter that, once it picks up a potential meal's scent, rarely stops seeking its prey until its appetite is sated. A kronosaurus's diet consists of everything from large fish and sharks to small whales, giant squids, and sea turtles. Remains of other giant saurians have reportedly been found in the stomachs of those rare kronosauruses that are killed by hunters or wash up dead on shore. Unlike other reptiles, a kronosaurus does not lay eggs, but instead births its young live. The young kronosauruses stay with their mother for less than a year before parting ways and hunting on their own. A fully grown kronosaurus can reach lengths of up to 50 feet and weigh as much as 40,000 pounds.</Description>

    <Description>The nothosaur resembles a smaller version of the land-based brachiosaurus, sharing the distinctive long neck and tail and short legs of its herbivorous brethren. Nothosaurs are also similar in many ways to seals-they spend much of their time in the water, including when they hunt, but emerge to sleep and breed on land. They lay their eggs in massive sandy mounds in the summer, then abandon their nests and slip back into the sea. A nothosaur is most vulnerable out of the water, but when caught unawares, it can return to the water with alarming speed, notwithstanding its awkwardly short legs and disproportionately large neck and tail. Nothosaurs can exist in water of any temperature, but prefer the warmer equatorial waters. Herds of nothosaurs make seasonal migrations, following schools of fish over the course of many months. From head to the tip of its tail, an adult nothosaur is 12 feet long and weighs 3,000 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Hold Breath (Ex) A zeuglodon can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to 4 times its Constitution score before it risks drowning. Thrash (Ex) A zeuglodon grappling a foe can thrash its body back and forth rapidly, dealing extra damage due to the violent motion of its whipping head. This attack deals 4d8+19 points of damage, but allows the grappled creature a free attempt to escape the grapple. If a creature escapes, it is thrown 30 feet in a random direction by the zeuglodon's erratic thrashing.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The primordial zeuglodon is often mistaken for a dinosaur or other large reptile, in part because of its almost crocodilian mouth as well as its snake-like elongation. Despite these features, it is more closely related to whales and other cetaceans than either aquatic reptiles or fish. A zeuglodon moves through the water with a vertical anguiliform (eel-like) motion that seems almost to be a primitive version of the efficient fluke-driven locomotion of its cetacean relatives. Zeuglodons breathe air through blowholes on the tops of their heads, though they lack the lung capacity to stay underwater for as long as their more evolved kin. The relative dimensions of their angular heads are too small to encase the enlarged brains or melons developed by other cetaceans for echolocation or communication with others of their kind, and as such zeuglodons are less social than whales and dolphins. What they lack in specialized anatomy, however, they make up for in sheer ferocity and speed. A hunting zeuglodon is a furious foe to contend with. An adult zeuglodon measures around 50 feet long and weighs upward of 50,000 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Cacophony (Su) A seaweed siren sings clashing melodies and babbles discordant noise while attacking. Casting a spell within 100 feet of a seaweed siren requires a concentration check (DC 15 + the level of the spell being cast). In addition, all other concentration checks and Perception checks involving hearing have their DCs increased by 5. A seaweed siren can begin or end this ability as a free action. Strident Squall (Su) A seaweed siren can blast its enemies with bolts of sonic energy. As a ranged touch attack, a seaweed siren can fire one ray out of each of its heads at a range of 60 feet dealing 4d6 points of sonic damage. The rays can be fired at different targets or the same target. Terrible Gaze (Su) Staggered 1d6 rounds, 30 feet, Will DC 22 negates. The save DC is Charisma-based. Three-Headed (Ex) Reducing a seaweed siren's number of heads reduces the creature's ability to use its strident squall special attack. To sever a head, an opponent must make a sunder attempt with a slashing weapon targeting the head. A head is considered a separate weapon with hardness 0 and hit points equal to the seaweed siren's number of hit dice. To sever a head, an opponent must inflict enough damage to reduce the head's hit points to 0 or less. Severing a head deals an amount of damage to the seaweed siren's body equal to the seaweed siren's number of hit dice. A seaweed siren can't attack with a severed head, and a seaweed siren with no remaining heads can't use its cacophony or uttered curse special abilities or its spell-like abilities. Uttered Curse (Su) Once per day, a seaweed siren can cast bestow curse (DC 20) as a spell-like ability at a range of 30 feet. The save DC is Charisma-based. Water Dependency (Ex) A seaweed siren can survive out of the water for 1 hour per point of Constitution. Beyond this limit, a seaweed siren runs the risk of suffocation, as if it were drowning.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>On first glance, this creature appears to blur the line between plant and animal. Three eyeless heads sway above the central body mass, constantly singing, chanting, and speaking in nonsense languages and simple babble. Seaweed covers the creature's three false heads and its main central body-a form of camouf lage to help the beast remain hidden while hunting. Six stout, crablike legs carry this creature along the coast and through the rocky tide pools it inhabits. A seaweed siren stands over 8 feet tall from the tip of its stubby legs to the top of its heads, and is nearly 7 feet in diameter. The creature weighs upward of 3,500 pounds. Ecology Seaweed sirens hunt near the shore, where they wait for clam diggers strolling the beaches, lone fisherfolk, or even passing ships. Once a seaweed siren spots its prey, the creature lurks just under the water and allows its three strange heads to protrude above the surface. The swaying heads sing songs and babble in strange nonsense languages to fuel the seaweed siren's many special abilities. Even when not in use against a potential meal, the heads seemingly converse with each other, holding lengthy conversations full of random syllables and made-up words. Once it draws its prey near, the seaweed siren attempts to charm or bewilder its foe to gain the advantage. After this, the creature moves closer and begins to devour its still-living victim. While the seaweed siren prefers to dine on living humanoids, it uses its strident squall attacks to incapacitate or kill prey that flees or resists its charm attempts. Seaweed sirens use a form of aggressive mimicry, appearing to have humanoid features in order to lure in their preferred meals. A seaweed siren's heads are nothing more than appendages. While they have mouths the creature can breathe through, it doesn't eat using these mouths. Seaweed sirens' heads grow differently depending on where the creature developed in order to match the skin tone and apparent ethnicity of the surrounding humanoid population. In addition, the heads are eyeless-the siren sees using the many eyes on its main body mass. A seaweed siren's eyes twist and spin within their sockets when the creature uses its terrible gaze attack. When seaweed sirens can't find their favored food- intelligent creatures and humanoids-they can subsist on fish, but they prefer aquatic mammals as an alternative. Seals and sea otters find their way into a seaweed siren's mouth most often, but the creature must actively hunt those morsels, as its particular bait is ineffective against the animals and more likely to scare them off than to lure them closer. Some sailors report larger and more dangerous variations of the seaweed siren. If these reports are true, some seaweed sirens measure twice the size of regular ones, and possess more than three heads and more powerful abilities. Habitat &amp; Society Seaweed sirens live solitary lives, rarely if ever encountering others of their kind. It's unclear to scholars how these creatures procreate, but they must have some method, since they've been spotted along Golarion's coasts for thousands of years. Some who research the strange monsters pose the theory that seaweed sirens birth their young from thick leathery shells, much like turtle eggs or fibrous seeds. Seaweed sirens sometimes ally themselves with other aquatic creatures to share in hunts or for mutual protection. Sahuagin typically don't trust the seaweed sirens, nor do they have the patience to work too closely with the creatures for long, but they have been known to befriend a seaweed siren and work with it long enough to capture new slaves and restock their humanoid food supply. Locathah sometimes use these strange beasts as protectors, keeping the seaweed sirens well fed in return for the creatures serving as lookouts and sentinels. Merfolk and aquatic elves avoid seaweed sirens, and even go so far as to sometimes warn other humanoid communities when one is discovered to be hunting nearby. A seaweed siren can speak Aklo, and constantly babbles in glossolalia, but if it manages to talk with another sentient being that has a language long enough, it begins mimicking the other's language and speech patterns, eventually sounding exactly like it. Though a seaweed siren can use its tongues spell to understand and speak any language, it prefers to talk with and mimic its conversational partners without resorting to using this ability. Some speculate the creature catalogs every conversation in order to add to the collection of sounds and words that power its cacophony special ability.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Fear Aura (Su) A bishop's eerie, fishlike appearance evokes feelings of unsettling fear in foes within a 30-foot radius. The bishop can use this aura as a free action, and any creature within this area must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or become shaken for 5d6 rounds. A creature that succeeds at its save is immune to the bishop's aura for 24 hours. The save DC is Wisdom-based. Stunning Strike (Ex) Five times per day, a bishop can stun a creature it hits with a claw attack. The targeted creature must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Possessing perhaps one of the strangest appearances of all agathions, bishops look as much like fish as they do humans. On their native plane of Nirvana, bishop agathions act as liaisons between the celestial generals of the lands and seas, though their activity is not restricted to Nirvana alone. Bishop agathions perform their duties anyplace their adaptive bodies are needed, such as on watery planes or worlds that are wholly aquatic. The few mortals who have met these noble creatures report that bishop agathions can traverse even the roughest and driest terrain as easily as they can glide through the deepest, most isolated oceans. It's believed bishop agathions are born from the souls of mortals who led lives of harmonized duality on land and at sea-goodly sailors, ocean-hopping priests, or kindhearted fisherfolk all are said to be candidates for rebirth as these fascinating creatures. Bishop agathions' striking coloration ranges from glittering silver to sparkling coral to smoky auburn and green. Layers of fine, translucent fins cascade down their bodies, and combine with the strange enzymes in their skin to give them the appearance of being perpetually wet. Bishops' heads are rounded, tentacles grow like beards from their chins, and their eyes-which come in all the colors of the tumultuous waves-look like those of a fish, but with a distinguished glint. Bishops' bodies vaguely resemble those of humans in shape, but webbing in their hands and feet facilitates deep-sea travel. Bishop agathions typically stand about 6 feet tall and weigh anywhere from 140 to 250 pounds. Ecology On Nirvana, other agathions respect bishops for their ability to think clearly, logically, and with the best interest of all parties in mind. Because of this, bishop agathions serve as Nirvana's trusted diplomatic liaisons. Bishops also have been known to carry vital messages between celestial beings and mortal heroes, who often see agathions through warped lenses. Far from being ashamed of their strange appearances, bishops consider their bodies to be among the most beautiful and versatile in all the planes-a fitting reward for a life well spent in meditation, martial mastery, and harmony with the seas. Anyone who suggests otherwise can count on incurring a bishop's ill will. Although primarily used as diplomats, messengers, and celestial ambassadors, bishops also excel in battle. With the power of Nirvana behind them, bishops' claws and nimble fighting style eliminate enemies who stand in the way of their missions. More martially inclined bishops often choose to wield quarterstaves, many of which are enchanted. Bishop agathions don't go looking for fights, but they intervene when they come across those imposing cruelty or evil on innocents. Bishops particularly abhor piracy and slavery. Legends speak of more than one unlucky pirate slave master who, ostensibly mad, spent his final days blubbering about the tentacle-beards that destroyed his ship and drowned his crew. No one takes these stories seriously except for the few who've become acquainted with bishops' complex ways. Habitat &amp; Society Bishops typically conduct their diplomatic work alone. However, planar experts believe that on Nirvana bishops more commonly work in pairs when dealing with simple matters of diplomacy or while on courier missions. When their missions are especially vital, bishop agathions work in contingents of six to eight, engaging in lengthy discussions and lively debate to find the best solution to their particular problem. These conferences sometimes last a long time, and some of the more hotheaded celestials regard them as a great waste of time. These contingents of bishop agathions can, some experts believe, cross into the mortal realm, and though such sightings have yet to be recorded, philosophical texts from across Golarion seem to reach similar conclusions. The few reported bishop agathion sightings in the Inner Sea mention only one agathion being seen at a time, and these reports are concentrated along the shores of western Varisia, particularly in the Varisian Gulf near Magnimar. Outside of the Inner Sea region, the majority of reports of bishop agathions come from the other side of the world. Some researchers who study the planes believe that a portal to either Nirvana's oceans or the Plane of Water lies in the southern region of the Embaral Ocean, since both the western coast of Tian Xia and the eastern coast of Casmaron report more instances of bishop agathions than does the Inner Sea region. Like other outsiders, bishops do not need to eat or sleep while spending time on Golarion. Additionally, bishops do not reproduce among themselves; each individual is formed from the soul of a good mortal. It's believed bishops retain the deep emotions that marked their mortal lives, giving them a propensity to fall in love with creatures living outside their native plane. Ancient stories speak of bishops who traveled to Golarion for missions, only to fall in love with a remarkable member of an aquatic species. Some coastal storytellers even claim that merfolk, with their otherworldly beauty, descended from such a union, and that sahuagin are their corrupted cousins. Predictably, debates about the veracity of such claims have raged for as long as these tales have been told. Although few known bishop agathions remain on Golarion for any length of time, some cultures revere their arrival as an omen of fortune and luck. Those seeing a bishop agathion-and being entrusted with its diplomatic knowledge-consider the encounter to be the greatest honor one can receive. Therefore, groups of eager adventurers have set sail from Varisia over the years, hoping to reap the rewards of encountering one of these strange creatures. These seekers are inevitably disappointed. Bishops appear to only those with whom they have business-or whose evil they witness and wish to stop.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Sinful Bite (Su) Each fleshdreg possesses an additional attack depending on its particular sin type. The save DCs are Charisma-based. Envy: An envy fleshdreg's bite attack can temporarily interfere with magic. If an envy fleshdreg deals damage with its bite attack to any creature under a magic effect, the fleshdreg makes a dispel check as if it were caster level 3rd against the spell of the highest caster level. If the dispel check is successful, the effect is suppressed for 1d4 rounds. Gluttony: A gluttony fleshdreg's bite attack can wither and weaken the body of the creature it attacks. Any creature that takes damage from a gluttony fleshdreg's bite attack must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or become fatigued. Subsequent uses of this ability do not cause a creature to become exhausted. Greed: A greed fleshdreg's bite can twist and warp the body of a creature it attacks. Any creature that takes damage from a greed fleshdreg's bite attack must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or have its speed reduced by half and take a -2 penalty to Strength and Dexterity for 1d6 rounds. Lust: A lust fleshdreg's bite can addle the mind of the creature it attacks. Any creature that takes damage from a lust fleshdreg's bite attack must succeed at a DC 12 Will save or become confused for 1 round. creature it attacks. Any creature that takes damage from a pride fleshdreg's bite attack must succeed at a DC 12 Will save or be blinded for 1 round and dazzled for the next 1d4 rounds. Sloth: A sloth fleshdreg's bite conjures an amber crust that covers the target and restricts the target's movements. Any creature that takes damage from a sloth fleshdreg's bite attack must succeed at a DC 12 Reflex save or take a -2 penalty on attack rolls and Reflex saves for 1d4 rounds. Wrath: A wrath fleshdreg's bite delivers energy damage to creatures it attacks. Any creature that takes damage from a wrath fleshdreg's bite attack takes an additional 1d4 points of energy damage (fleshdreg's choice). Sin-Scent (Su) Fleshdregs have scent against creatures whose nature reflects the fleshdreg's related sin. For example, a wrathful fleshdreg can scent creatures using rage effects. The GM should adjudicate what creatures a particular fleshdreg can scent.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Sometimes a runewell becomes erratic after millennia without maintenance and disgorges an incomplete horror. Such misshapen lumps of tissue, appendages, and biting mouths are called fleshdregs. These incomplete sinspawn creep around forgotten ruins of the Thassilonian empire. Some escape the ruins and make their way to the surface to feed upon the sins of humankind. Fleshdregs vary in appearance from one another depending on various factors, such as the sins that powered their creation and the runewells that spawned them. Wrathful fleshdregs develop with a more predatory form than lustful fleshdregs do, and slothful fleshdregs look like little more than bloated piles of flesh atop stubby legs. Most fleshdregs stand between 3 and 4 feet tall, and weigh little more than 60 pounds. Greed fleshdregs are the tallest of their kind, and sloth fleshdregs the heaviest. Ecology Fleshdregs are practically immortal. They require little food to sustain their unnatural physiology, and don't seem to age or mature beyond the moment of creation. Violence or accidents claim the lives of fleshdregs more often than anything else. Fleshdregs emerge from runewells that have malfunctioned over the ages-no self-respecting follower of Thassilonian magic would want to create such pitiful creatures, after all. Sometimes a runewell absorbs particularly sinful souls through a soul lens without the device being calibrated correctly; other times, a creature is marked with a Sihedron rune to have its soul collected, and the inscriber performs the ritual incorrectly. In either case, the collected sins cause the runewell to vomit forth these broken, spoiled sinspawn. Habitat &amp; Society Fleshdregs follow true sinspawn around like pets or curious children. Sinspawn use these weaker creatures as slaves, troops, or hunting companions. Though they're treated horribly, fleshdregs still seek out the company of their larger, more advanced cousins. Despite their low intelligence, these pitiful creatures recognize the Sihedron rune and its connection to their creation. Many fleshdregs remain in the ruins of their birthplace, surrounded by Sihedron runes, for this very reason, waiting patiently for the return of their runelord masters. Fleshdregs behave differently according to their associated sins. Sloth fleshdregs rarely hunt for sinful creatures, preferring to keep to their lairs, while wrath fleshdregs are the most likely to wander outside of a Thassilonian ruin as they seek to spread rage.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Arcane Bite (Su) A fleshdreg swarm's swarm damage is considered magical for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction.

    <Description>Fleshdreg swarms form from scraps and leftovers of malformed fleshdregs and incomplete sinspawn.

    <SpecialAbilities>Envelop (Ex) The Malfesh Monster can wrap a Medium or smaller creature in its vines as a standard action. The Melfesh Monster attempts a grapple that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and deals 1d4 points of Wisdom damage if the target fails a DC 17 Fortitude save. Attacks that hit the Melfesh Monster while it has a target enveloped deal half their damage to the monster and half to the trapped victim. Poison Cloud (Ex) The Melfesh Monster can exude a cloud of poisonous gas in a 20-foot radius up to 3 times per day. Creatures in the area must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d4 rounds and sickened for 1d4 hours afterward. This is a poison effect, and the save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The sleepy town of Melfesh has endured threats ranging from a gang of displaced troglodytes causing havoc to the strained political ramifications of having a drawbridge controlling trade through southeastern Varisia, but none trouble the place like the Melfesh Monster. Miners working the foothills of the Fenwall Mountains and farmers in the countryside surrounding Melfesh speak in hushed tones of a strange and malevolent monster that haunts the area. Those who claim to have encountered the thing return from their encounters pale and ill, speaking of a bizarre plantlike creature with burning red eyes, and twisted limbs that shoot jets of flame. A stench like acrid, burning dung follows the monster. Some who encounter the creature stumble out of the woods addlepated, raving of a hovering creature and its fire and poisonous mist. Adults away from the safety of town aren't the only ones terrorized by the creature, as parents use embellished stories of the Melfesh Monster to frighten children into behaving properly. Ecology Very little information is recorded about the Melfesh Monster, since so few have seen the creature. A handful of researchers enamored with studying monsters have written about the creature on their travels through Varisia, though no two accounts agree on its true nature. Some think it to be from another world or dimension, while others believe it is a plant creature of magical sentience, akin to a corrupted treant or some dark, fey-stricken creature. Even the camp claiming otherworldly origin is split on the details. Some say the Malfesh Monster hails from the horrid wastes of Abaddon, and others insist the First World birthed this frightening creature. Both its form and behavior could easily suit either of these theories. The Melfesh Monster never consumes its kills; it simply leaves charred corpses, twisted by fear, in its wake. Victims of the Melfesh Monster are found curled into a fetal position and burned so thoroughly they are barely recognizable to even their closest friends and relatives. Some speculate the creature feeds on strong feelings of agony, despair, and terror. Most who encounter the Melfesh Monster are solitary travelers, miners, hunters, or farmers. This suggests the creature prefers to prey upon single targets, but a few stories tell of it attacking a wagon full of farmers returning from a day at the market or a trio of teenage boys playing around in the woods at night. Either way, as of late, most citizens of Melfesh and the surrounding countryside don't go out alone after dark for long. Habitat &amp; Society Officially, the Melfesh Monster exists only in the minds of drunkards and those prone to fanciful daydreams. The sparse evidence of the creature has yet to compel the local militia (or any of the nearby Hellknights) to mobilize any significant hunting party to eradicate the creature, and authorities who are shown places scorched by the monster's fiery jets write them off as merely small-scale wildfires caused by lightning or out-of-control campfires left by local hunters or miners. When would-be monster hunters show up in Melfesh, the locals have no shortage of stories to tell about the monster-usually heard from a distant cousin or a friend of a friend who claimed to have seen it. Several unscrupulous merchants in the area made a small industry of selling bits of slag supposedly resulting from the monster's fire, or maps to various caves and lairs the monster might inhabit. With little credible information to go on, and the creature's ability to fly making it impossible to track, most of the hunters give up the chase after having their purses lightened at nearby inns and taverns. To date, no lair thought to belong to the creature has been found, nor have any tracks of the Melfesh Monster been accurately identif ied ( just the scorch marks from its jets of flame). In Melfesh, sketches of the creature hang on the walls in taverns and inns, some drawn by those who encountered the creature and lived, and others sketched by those interested in the monster and the stories about it. All of these depictions are roughly the same, though some contain certain embellishments or exaggerations, such as extra appendages, varying color schemes, or inf lated body size. Some inn owners sell these drawings to monster hunters for prices that fluctuate wildly, seemingly set only by how severely the inn owners think they can gouge any particular buyer. Just last fall, a group hailing from Korvosa bought a skillfully drawn illustration of the Melfesh Monster from a tavern for 10 gold pieces, though it was little help to the group in finding the monster. Though the monster has became a major nuisance only in the last 30 years, stories with details matching recent accounts of the Melfesh Monster circulated among the Varisian wanderers as long as 600 years ago. These tales, told around campfires as a warning to the traveling people, hint that a creature like the monster-or even the monster itself-has been a threat in the region for a long time. No one knows what made the creature lie dormant for so long, and frankly, the frightened populace is merely waiting until this particular bit of local folklore fades into the past.</Description>

    <Description>A combination of hare and grouse, skyvaders boast features and mannerisms of both animals. At first glance, a skvader appears to be a common hare, though its shorter ears distinguish it from the longer-eared rabbits. Its wings, hindquarters, and tail usually have a coloration similar to its fur, and its birdlike features are only easily distinguishable up close. Skvaders are twitchy and nervous, constantly on the lookout for predators. They switch between standing stock still upon sensing danger and quickly bolting to escape. While generally docile, skvaders become dangerous if cornered. A skvader is about 1-1/2 feet long and weighs around 10 pounds. Ecology Skvaders live primarily in temperate forests, though they are also found in hillier regions with enough vegetation to provide them easy sustenance. They're also drawn to open, low-lying areas, particularly farm fields and plains covered in an abundance of tall grasses upon which they can feed. Their high metabolisms give these herbivores voracious appetites, which force them to consume such large quantities of plants that they pose significant threats to farmers' livelihoods. A family of skvaders infesting a farmer's fields can lay waste to his crops in just a couple of weeks. Once they've destroyed the vegetation in an area, the skyvaders move on to nearby farms and continue feeding. If cornered, a skvader emits a shrill screech that can be heard as far as a mile away. Other skvaders in the area immediately rush to its aid, causing a confrontation with a lone skvader to quickly escalate into a fight with a ferocious group of the creatures. When in combat, a skvader prefers to single out a threat and attach itself to that target. Scholars postulate that skvaders are a lesser form of their wolpertinger cousins, a variant that never fully developed into the greater threat the wolpertinger is. Others believe that the skvader is a distant precursor to the owlbear, citing the combination of mammalian and avian features, though on a much smaller scale. These scholars believe skvaders might have been an early experiment to combine two creatures into one, undertaken by the same lunatic wizard who supposedly created the owlbear. Habitat &amp; Society To protect themselves and secure a safe birthing environment, skyvaders often dig small burrows. A large enough skvader population frightens off other small herbivores, which leave their burrows behind for the skvaders to claim. They sometimes have to spend some time expanding the burrow's size, particularly if one or more wolpertingers are among the pack. In skvader families, adult females care for the young and the males dig the burrows, patrol for predators, and offer protection when their mates deliver a litter. Skvaders mate for life, though if one of a mated pair dies, the other seeks a new mate after a mourning period. Skvader young often stay with their parents for the first year of life. Multiple skvader families in the same region generally coexist peacefully. If one family grows significantly larger than the others, the smaller family simply moves on to new feeding grounds. Skvaders and Wolpertingers as Familiars While most skvaders and wolpertingers prefer the company of their families and packs, occasionally the more adventurous among them come to serve as familiars. Service to a powerful spellcaster brings with it protection and long-term companionship, which these creatures take advantage of. A neutral spellcaster can gain a skvader as a familiar at 3rd level by taking the Improved Familiar feat, and a neutral spellcaster can gain a wolpertinger as a familiar at 5th level by taking the Improved Familiar feat.</Description>

    <Description_Visual>This creature appears to be a large hare with long fangs, feathered wings, and a set of antlers.</Description_Visual>
    <Source>AP 61</Source>
    <IsTemplate>0</IsTemplate>
    <Description>Wolpertingers are a bizarre amalgamation of hare and bird with the antlers of a deer. A wolpertinger's mottled fur ranges from light browns and tans to nearly black. A pair of brown-and-tan feathered wings sprouts from its back. While on the ground, wolpertingers fold these wings tight to their bodies. Fierce predators, wolpertingers hunt in packs using clever tactics. While capable of flight, they find prolonged flight taxing and tend to stay on the ground most of the time. A wolpertinger has a 4-foot wingspan, is nearly 2 feet long, and weighs around 15 pounds. Ecology Wolpertingers are usually encountered in temperate forests and hills, though scarcity of their favored foods can sometimes drive them to warmer or colder climes. Though they are omnivores, wolpertingers prefer fresh meat to grasses and berries. They typically hunt creatures smaller than themselves (favoring rabbits, mice, squirrels, and the like), but often take on larger predatory animals, such as foxes. Given a large enough pack, wolpertingers can even take down a solitary wolf. Wolpertingers mate only once per year, in the spring. Kits stay with their packs until they are full-grown, but rarely remain with their birth-packs beyond a year, instead setting out to establish their own packs. Habitat &amp; Society Though related to skvaders, wolpertingers are quite different beasts. Unlike their somewhat nomadic cousins, wolpertingers are aggressive and fiercely territorial. Packs stake out territories large enough for their hunting needs, and keep constantly vigilant against invaders. At the first indication of any significant threat, the pack mobilizes and attempts to kill or drive off the intruders. This territoriality extends to different packs of wolpertingers, though multiple packs have been known to coexist peacefully near one another as long as none of them violates another pack's territory. When on the hunt, wolpertingers vary their approaches, from slinking through the underbrush to flying in from above, as befits the terrain and the capabilities of their prey. When approaching from afar, they charge in quickly to get close enough to deal a forceful attack with their horns. Once in close combat, they gang up on their prey in flanking pairs. The strongest and oldest wolpertingers focus on melee, leaving the younger members of the pack to dart in for quick charges. Given their antlers, it's difficult for wolpertingers to create burrows like skvaders and normal hares. Instead, they seek shelter in naturally secluded areas as well as in the former dens of larger predators. Skvaders and Wolpertingers as Familiars While most skvaders and wolpertingers prefer the company of their families and packs, occasionally the more adventurous among them come to serve as familiars. Service to a powerful spellcaster brings with it protection and long-term companionship, which these creatures take advantage of. A neutral spellcaster can gain a skvader as a familiar at 3rd level by taking the Improved Familiar feat, and a neutral spellcaster can gain a wolpertinger as a familiar at 5th level by taking the Improved Familiar feat.</Description>

    <IsTemplate>0</IsTemplate>
    <SpecialAbilities>Aerial Charge (Ex) The snallygaster can hurl itself downward through the air at tremendous speed, using the force to inflict terrible wounds with its lance-like beak. When the snallygaster charges downward at an angle of 45 degrees or more, it deals double damage with its beak attack. If the charging beak attack is a critical hit, it deals triple damage instead. Bleed damage is not multiplied for this attack. Sucking Tentacles (Ex) A snallygaster uses its retractable tentacles to suck blood from its victim's already open wounds. Any creature affected by the snallygaster's bleed special attack that the snallygaster successfully grapples with its grab ability or maintains a grapple against takes double the amount of bleed damage at the beginning of its next turn. A snallygaster cannot make attacks with its beak in any round that it uses its tentacles in this way.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Strange things lurk in the wild places of the world, hiding in remote forests or isolated mountains, away from prying eyes. The snallygaster, a hideous amalgamation of lizard and bird that preys on unwary travelers, is one such creature. Black stripes run the length of its scaly green hide all the way to the tip of its long, sinuous tail. Muscular, membranous wings sprout from the creature's back, bearing it through the sky at tremendous speed. Its claws and beak have an almost metallic sheen to them, hinting at their sharpness and strength. The snallygaster's serpentine neck terminates at a small, birdlike head with a single eye set in the center of the forehead. In place of a tongue, its long throat contains a slobbering mass of tentacles that twist and squirm grotesquely whenever the creature extends them. A typical snallygaster measures 9 feet long from the tip of its tail to the point of its beak. Its wingspan measures over 15 feet, and it weighs approximately 200 pounds. Ecology The snallygaster, mainly carnivorous, subsists primarily on deer, sheep, or similar animals, although it prefers to hunt sentient creatures when given the chance. The snallygaster is an ambush predator, attacking its prey from above. Once it spots a potential victim, it soars high into the air before diving sharply down toward its unsuspecting foe, using the fall to build up momentum. At the end of the dive, the snallygaster impales its prey with its 2-foot-long serrated beak, plunging the razor-sharp bill straight into its victim's chest. The snallygaster's thick skull and muscular neck allow it to withstand the sudden impact unharmed, while its target usually suffers several broken bones and internal hemorrhaging. If its victim is stout or lucky enough to survive the initial attack, the snallygaster employs the vicious claws on its forelegs to inf lict savage wounds upon its foe. Once its foe lies dead or unconscious, the snallygaster uses its tonguelike tentacles to slurp up the victim's blood. Some experts theorize the snallygaster thirsts for blood because of its iron content, which might help maintain the semimetallic composition of the beast's beak and claws. Others claim the snallygaster's tentacle-f illed throat makes swallowing solid food diff icult, an idea supported by the creature's tendency to leave its kills out to rot for several days before consuming them. The truth may be that the snallygaster enjoys drinking the blood of its enemies, deriving a sort of ritualistic satisfaction from gulping down the still-warm life essence of its prey. If the snallygaster feels that it or its kill is being threatened, it uses its surprisingly powerful tentacles to latch on to the body and carry it deep into the forest where it can exsanguinate the corpse in peace. The only thing a snallygaster craves more than blood is alcohol. Scholars still debate whether this is an instinctive dependency, or whether a snallygaster acquires the addiction later in life. What is known is that snallygasters spend much of each fall scouring their territories for fermenting fruit, which they gorge themselves on until thoroughly inebriated. Snallygasters grow extremely aggressive when intoxicated. When drunk they rampage across the countryside in a violent stupor, slaughtering anyone and anything that crosses their paths. Snallygasters that range into lands populated by humanoids quickly develop a taste for man-made liquor, especially distilled spirits. Such drinks are far more potent than the snallygaster's natural sources of alcohol, and regularly imbibing them can greatly exacerbate the snallygaster's addiction. Even the most cautious of snallygasters can go mad with desire once it catches the scent of drink. It charges into town, heedless of danger, and smashes its way into a local still or brew-house, leaving a trail of victims in its wake. One survivor's report tells of a snallygaster so entranced by the smell of whiskey mash that it dove headfirst into a brewing vat, where it quickly succumbed to the fumes and drowned. Habitat &amp; Society Snallygasters might inhabit any remote, backwoods area of Avistan, but are most often encountered in the wilds of Varisia. They prefer to nest in wooded, mountainous regions where they can put their camouf lage to good use. Snallygasters are primarily active during the day, which they spend searching for food or scaring off rivals. A snallygaster claims a quite large territory, often hundreds of miles wide, though snallygasters rarely keep the same territory for more than a year at a time. Eventually, the snallygaster grows bored with the area-or is overcome by wanderlust-and sets off in search of a more interesting roost. When snallygasters meet, they regard each other coolly, but rarely fight over territory. The conf licts that do arise are almost never lethal, though the presence of a particularly valuable resource in the area, such as easy access to human victims or a reliable supply of alcohol, can turn such a contest into a bloody aerial combat. Snallygasters assemble during mating season since they have few opportunities to reproduce. Female snallygasters lay only one to two eggs per year, which they consume if the eggs are not quickly fertilized by a male snallygaster. Should a male snallygaster present himself, the female allows him to fertilize the egg, and then immediately retreats with it and hides it somewhere high in the mountains. Occasionally humans run across these melon-sized eggs and attempt to hatch them, usually with disastrous results. Snallygasters cannot be trained, and are lethal predators at the age of 4 weeks. Snallygasters are not afraid of humans, though they are intelligent enough to refrain from attacking large or well-armed groups of them. A snallygaster whose territory includes a human settlement genuinely enjoys terrorizing the community, often by flying just out of bow shot and screeching at the residents. It's no surprise then that snallygasters figure strongly in some early Varisian and Shoanti myths. The Shoanti name for the creature is a corruption of the Skald phrase for "swift ghost," chosen because the creature's attacks come suddenly and silently, and also for the way the monster disappears into the forest after claiming a victim's life. When Chelish explorers arrived in Varisia, they further corrupted the name into the creature's modern appellation, "snallygaster."</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Acid Spray (Ex) Every 1d4 rounds, a somalcygot can spit a 60-foot line of acid that deals 6d6 points of acid damage and an additional 3d6 points of acid damage the following round. A successful DC 26 Reflex save halves the initial damage and negates all ongoing damage. The save DC is Constitution-based. Resistant Evolution (Su) Somalcygots have evolved in the harsh, unforgiving vacuum of space and developed fortified resistances to the myriad threats found in their environment, granting them a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Somalcygots are incredibly territorial; each claims roughly a mile-radius patch of desolate lunar surface as its chosen hunting ground, and only enters another's territory to mate. In order to preserve energy between meals, a somalcygot enters a trancelike hibernation during which it burrows in circles beneath the moon's surface within its territory with unthinking repetition. When it detects another creature nearby, the somalcygot awakens and enters a blood frenzy to capitalize on the rare meal, fighting relentlessly until the prey either is dead or escapes its territory. Only rarely do somalcygots pursue prey beyond the boundaries of their claimed hunting grounds, a behavior that serves both to preserve energy and to avoid needless conflict with other somalcygots that claim neighboring regions. A typical adult somalcygot is 16 feet long and weighs 1,500 pounds.</Description>

    <Description>The ageless monuments and awesome cities of Thassilon rose upon the backs of countless slaves, but none bore the sin-poisoned civilization's burden more than the giants. Able to perform the work of dozens of human slaves, Thassilon's titanic servants-hill giants, stone giants, taiga giants, and others-crafted marvels nigh unparalleled in any era before or since, and shaped the face of what is now modern Varisia. Yet as viciously as the runelords worked their slaves and for all they demanded, the giant-crafted marvels were not enough. And thus, working the corrupt rune magic that was theirs alone, the runelords manufactured a damning curse and laid it over their most tireless and effective workers, and in so doing created a new breed of servant: the runeslave. Numerous severe-looking runes spark and flicker upon a runeslave's body, seemingly seared into the creature's flesh. One of the runes is larger and more prominent than the others-this is always one of the runes of Thassilonian magic. Although a runeslave's mind is dulled, its muscles bulge grotesquely, as if barely contained beneath a thin layer of skin, and such behemoths move with unnatural agility for creatures of their ponderous size. Note that while the runeslave template does make a giant more powerful (and thus increases its CR), few, if any giants would seek to gain a runeslave's powers. Despite the advantages the runeslave gains, what it loses in free will and longevity typically vastly outweigh the benefits. In combat, a runeslave is deadly and terrifying, but in life, the condition is rightly feared among giants as a devastating and debilitating curse. Creating a Runeslave "Runeslave" is an acquired template that can be added to any giant (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A runeslave uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here. CR: Same as the base creature +1. DEFENSIVE ABILITIES: A runeslave becomes immune to fear effects, exhaustion, and fatigue. In addition, all runeslaves gain the following additional defensive ability. Resist Pain (Ex): Runeslaves can continue to function even after taking great punishment. They are immune to nonlethal damage. Against effects that inf lict pain (such as a symbol of pain spell), a runeslave gains a +4 bonus on all saving throws. WEAKNESSES: Runeslaves gain the following weakness. Arcane Decay (Su): The symbols etched upon a runeslave's body put great stress on its physical form, choking its mind and ultimately killing the giant in time. Each runeslave has a predominant Thassilonian rune associated with one school of magic inscribed on its body. Traditionally, this rune is of a school of magic directly opposed to the runelord the runeslave serves- all of the runeslaves encountered in this adventure bear the sign of wrath upon their bodies as a sort of brand of shame. The slow decay of a runeslave's mental faculties manifests as a gradual loss of life and sanity, represented by the accumulation of rune-shaped scars all over the body. The disease has no additional physical or mental effect until these magical runescars completely overwhelm their host, at which point the accumulated pain the giant has endured since becoming a runeslave is released in a fatal surge of unleashed suffering. All runeslaves are "infected" with this disease. Only limited wish, miracle, or wish can prevent or cure arcane decay, but in so doing removes the entire template, reverting the runeslave back to the base creature. Multiple successful Fortitude saves only delay the decay and do not cure the creature of the disease. Arcane Decay: Inherited-non-contagious; save Fortitude DC 15; frequency 1/week; effect gain one runescar; cure none (but see above). When a runeslave's number of runescars equals its Hit Dice, it dies. SPEED: A runeslave's base land speed is 20 feet faster than the base creature's. Other forms of movement, such as flying or swim speeds, are unaffected. SPECIAL ATTACKS: A runeslave gains the following special attack. Arcane Surge (Su): Once per day as a swift action, a runeslave can gain the benefits of the spell haste for 6 rounds. Using this ability forces the giant to make an additional Fortitude save against arcane decay, even if it has already made its weekly save to resist the disease. ABILITIES: Change from the base creature as follows: Str +4, Dex +2, Int -2, Wis -2, Cha -2. FEATS: Runeslaves gain Diehard and Toughness as bonus feats. The Runeslave Curse As the act of turning their giant servants into runeslaves swept across Thassilon, each of the seven runelords came to employ the corruptive magic in various ways. While in most of the runelords' holdings the giants merely continued to serve as expendable labor, in Bakrakhan, Runelord Alaznist incorporated runeslaves into her vast armies, using them as living siege engines. In Cyrusian, the domain of Pride, Runelord Xanderghul used the magic as a punishment upon any slave who garnered his fickle ire. While the magic used to create runeslaves resided almost exclusively in the hands of the runelords, the number of giant slaves they deemed would benefit from this ultimately fatal "improvement" far exceeded the rulers' ability to transform. Thus, a number of different methods of creating runeslaves were created, each originating in a separate domain but eventually spreading throughout the empire. ANCIENT RITE: In the Grand Sybaritum of Xin- Haruka, Runelord Krune grew weary of cursing filthy giant after filthy giant, and so devised a method to transform hundreds of his slaves at a time. Summoning whole legions of his giants before him, Krune called down the might of the rune goddess Lissala and cursed his slaves en masse, sending countless faithful slaves to their doom. MINDERHAL'S CURSE: Minderhal's worship was never more prevalent than during the height of the Thassilonian empire, and as such, fear of his displeasure was a motivating force among the giants of that era. Legend held that Minderhal himself was involved in the creation of the first runeslaves, and that in a fit of anger at his giant worshipers, he granted humans the secrets of creating runeslaves. Regardless of this legend's veracity, there have been several cases of particularly blasphemous giants spontaneously transforming into runeslaves, supposedly as punishment from their god. POISONING: In Edasseril, the domain of envy, the alchemists of Runelord Belimarius's vile and sprawling laboratories discovered a way to turn arcane decay into a toxin, allowing the disease to be delivered via poison. The poisoners never did find a way to cure the crippling madness caused by the poison-the toxin's high cost and the frustrating requirement of having to cure the giant's Wisdom drain before it could be put to work kept this poison from seeing greater use. Runeslave Poison: Poison-ingested; save Fort DC 20; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect confusion for 1 round and 1d4 Wisdom drain (if this results in the giant's Wisdom being drained to 0, the giant immediately transforms into a runeslave); cure 3 consecutive saves; cost 10,000 gp. RUNESLAVE CAULDRON: Brought forth from Gastash, the domain of gluttony, these massive cauldrons were large enough to fit an adult stone giant and infused with necromantic energies. Any giant placed in a cauldron and then slain is immediately resurrected as a runeslave-see page 424 for further details on these sadistic magic items.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Blood-Draining Gaze (Su) All creatures within 20 feet of a scarlet walker are subject to the monster's eerie blood-draining gaze. Affected creatures must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or thin streams of blood pour from their eyes, flowing through the air and into the eye socket-like pits in the scarlet walker's face. This does not impact the victim's vision, but does deal 1 point of Constitution damage and sickens the victim for 1 round from the hideous pain. A creature already suffering from a bleed effect takes a -4 penalty on the saving throw. This is a bleed effect. The save DC is Constitution-based. Bloodsense (Su) A scarlet walker can sense living creatures with blood in their veins, or undead creatures that feed on blood (such as vampires). This ability functions like blindsight to a range of 60 feet.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The scarlet walker is an alien entity from some other dimension, often conjured by the wizards of Thassilon to serve as a minion. Scarlet walkers were particularly favored for their adeptness at interrogating prisoners, either via torture, or via the creatures' uncanny ability to mentally compel both actions and compliance. Once an interrogation was over, the scarlet walker's master typically commanded the monster to render the victim insane or feebleminded if mere death wasn't appropriate. Scarlet walkers themselves hail from the nightmare realm of Leng, where they walk amid strange, stony deserts and stride through the skies above. No mere predators, scarlet walkers build immense hives of coagulated blood and tissue in nameless mountain valleys, and the flavors of various creatures' blood is an inexhaustible topic of discussion among their kind.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Behead (Ex) A skull ripper is an expert at collecting its favorite trophies-skulls. Once it has pinned a foe, it can attempt to behead the victim with a single gut-wrenching rip of its claws. This attempt is made as part of the grapple check to maintain an existing pin, and if successful, deals 4d6+18 points of damage to the victim. If this damage is enough to bring the target below 0 hit points, the victim must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save to resist having its head torn from its body, which results in instant death for most creatures. The save DC is Strength-based. Dread Visage (Su) All creatures within 30 feet that can see a skull ripper must make a DC 18 Will save at the start of their turn in order to avoid becoming frightened for 1 round. If the victim recognizes any of the heads affixed to the skull ripper's body as having once belonged to friends or allies, that victim takes a -4 penalty on the save. A creature that succeeds at the save is immune to the dread visage of that particular skull ripper for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. Poison (Su) Sting-injury; save Fort DC 17; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Dex; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Skull rippers were once guardians of the dead, the grim custodians of the great ossuaries of Thassilon. Although most skull rippers are discovered in ancient tombs and sepulchers, occasionally a geological upheaval or massive flood destroys a given catacomb or leaves a skull ripper stranded. In these cases, the construct emerges and ventures forth into the world above, harvesting skulls and causing widespread panic as it searches for a new tomb to guard. Construction A skull ripper is made from the carcasses of dead vermin and skulls, either harvested by the creator or purchased from shady adventurers for roughly 500 gp in total. SKULL RIPPER CL 13th; Price 30,500 gp CONSTRUCTION Requirements Craft Construct, animate dead, fear, geas/ quest, keen edge, limited wish; Skill Heal or Knowledge (engineering) DC 15; Cost 15,500 gp</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Disease (Ex) Bogwid Fever: Bite-injury; save Fort DC 16, onset 1 day, frequency 1/day, effect 1d2 Str damage and shaken, cure 2 consecutive saves. The DC save is Constitution-based. Nauseating Touch (Ex) The bogwid's touch is disgusting. Creatures hit by its slam attack must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based. Ravenous Young (Ex) Each round, a bogwid can launch one of the offspring clinging to its back at a target within 10 feet as a ranged touch attack. On a successful hit, the offspring attaches itself to the target and begins draining blood, automatically dealing 1d2 points of bleed damage each round (and possibly infecting the target with bogwid fever). As a full-round action, a creature can attempt to remove one of these offspring, either by bludgeoning it with a fist or pulling it off. Either way, removing an offspring kills the larval creature. Someone other than the target the offspring is attached to can also perform this action. Anyone using a weapon to kill or remove an attached offspring deals half of the damage to the creature to which the offspring is attached. A bogwid can launch up to 10 offspring per day before it must rest and gestate more larval young. Revolting Aura (Ex) The bogwid is both visually and odoriferously revolting. Any creature within 10 feet of a bogwid must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or be sickened. This effect persists as long as the creature is within the aura and for 2 rounds thereafter. A creature that successfully saves is not subject to the same bogwid's revolting aura for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Aberrant beasts of ancient origin, bogwids are loathsome, skulking predators that inhabit the gloomy swamps and damp subterranean places of the world. Looking like a bloated, eight-limbed, greenish-black mix of frog and tentacled beast, this asexual creature is most notorious for the larvae it carries on its back. Ecology Some scholars suggest the large, muscular body of the bogwid serves as little more than transport for its ravenous young-30 to 40 fist-sized, pustule-like protuberances that cling to its back, inf lating and def lating, shifting and quivering with disturbing vitality. The bogwid attacks with two of its undulating tentacles, the bottoms of which are lined with ragged, bony ridges that can tear hungrily into exposed flesh. However, the more disturbing danger is those pulsating orbs of flesh on its back: larvae that are capable of launching themselves as far as 10 feet and attaching to creatures with their fanged sucker mouths. Once one of these disgusting things sinks its jagged teeth into flesh, it begins sucking blood and does not release its grip until it or the target is dead. When a bogwid makes a kill, several of its young jump upon the warm carcass and feed greedily. If the victim is a Medium or larger creature, these rapacious larvae fight for the opportunity to burrow into the corpse. Over the course of 2 weeks, the burrowed creatures gestate, and the cadaver bloats until an adolescent bogwid (a bogwid with the young template) gruesomely bursts forth. The larger the kill, the more of the bogwid's young can burrow in and hatch out as adolescents; a Large victim can accommodate two larvae, a Huge victim four larvae, a Gargantuan victim eight larvae, and a Colossal victim 16 larvae. A creature smaller than Medium doesn't possess sufficient nutrition for bogwid larvae to gestate properly. As a result, adult bogwids tend to completely consume smaller kills instead of leaving them for the larvae. Bogwids that inhabit seaside haunts are not averse to eating carrion. Indeed, a sizable sea creature whose carcass washes ashore (a whale, for instance) is usually set upon by a nearby bogwid, whose ravenous larvae tunnel their way into the rotting flesh, and several days later erupt like a crawling, monstrous plague. In this way, large clutches of these foul beasts can come to infest coastal areas. The bogwid is generally nocturnal, though it is not unusual for one to hunt during the day if it has gone a long time without feeding. A bogwid hunts patiently, concealing itself well in its natural habitat by heaping sand, seaweed, vegetation, and other detritus onto its body. Though a bogwid possesses limited intelligence, its animal cunning allows it to employ natural hazards to its advantage, setting up ambushes that cleverly integrate drop-offs, natural pits, and quicksand. As these creatures are also able to climb, it is not uncommon for bogwids to roost on rocky overhangs or in large trees, dropping down on unsuspecting victims from above. Alchemists pay a significant price for the glands in bogwid tentacles that produce the foul, viscous liquid the creatures excrete. However, these glands are difficult to extract fully intact (DC 25 Heal check) and must be properly stored in water after removal. Appropriately dissected and transported, the glands fetch 25 gp apiece on the right market. Alchemists employ this putrid substance in various formulae to augment their effectiveness. Habitat &amp; Society Though great numbers of bogwids take up residence in temperate, swampy, coastal regions and the damp caves that are sometimes found in such places, plenty of the creatures inhabit inland marshes as well. They have been known to adapt to warmer climes, but tropical bogwids are much rarer. The fetid creatures tend not to flourish near major settlements, even if those settlements are in close proximity to the bogwids' natural habitat. The reason is that the presence of a beast like this near a town strikes such revulsion and fear into a population that they quickly post sizable rewards for the destruction of the beast. Rangers who traverse marshes and wet caves eagerly seek out such lucrative bounties. Indeed, the fact that these monsters have not been hunted to extinction is a testimony to their revolting fecundity. As these creatures are asexual, bogwids also tend to be solitary, driving off gestated offspring soon after they reach maturity. Recently matured bogwids seek out their own territory. On the few occasions bogwid clutches form, they most often include a single adult accompanied by two to eight adolescents. These abhorrent creatures have a life expectancy of about 10 years. An older bogwid can be identified by its flesh, which becomes gray-green and increasingly dry as the creature ages. The larvae an older bogwid carries about eventually lead to its own downfall. In the end, the strongest of its young fight off weaker kin and burrow into the dying parent, exploding forth from the corpse in the usual manner 2 weeks later. A bogwid does not tolerate other major predators in its territory, hounding them relentlessly until such competitors are killed or find alternate homes for themselves. The bogwid is especially aggressive against crocodiles, which tend to be its chief rivals for prey in swampy regions. In fact, a telltale sign of a bogwid having laid a claim to territory is the discovery of a crocodile corpse lying on its back, the stomach bloated with gestating larvae or torn out as though something exploded from within, suggesting an adolescent bogwid is not far away.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Sticky Tongue (Ex) A creature hit by a bogwiggle's tongue attack cannot move more than 10 feet away from the bogwiggle and takes a -2 penalty to AC as long as the tongue is attached (this penalty does not stack if multiple tongues are attached). The tongue can be removed by making an opposed Strength check as a standard action or by dealing 2 points of slashing damage to the tongue (AC 11, damage does not deplete the bogwiggle's actual hit points). The bogwiggle cannot move more than 10 feet away from the target, but can release its tongue's grip as a free action. Unlike a giant frog, a bogwiggle cannot pull targets toward it with its tongue. Swamp Stride (Ex) A bogwiggle can move through any sort of natural difficult terrain at its normal speed while within a swamp. Magically altered terrain affects a bogwiggle normally.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Bogwiggles, also known as toad-hounds, are the degenerate spawn of boggards. They appear to be dog-sized tadpoles that have stopped halfway through the transformation to full-f ledged frogs. A single set of long legs sprouts from a bogwiggle's bulbous body, and a thick, rudderlike tail protrudes from its back. Barely more intelligent than dogs, bogwiggles spend the majority of their short, violent lives serving as hunting and guard animals for their capricious, toadlike masters. Bogwiggles can live up to 20 years, but because of swamp predators and the cruelty of their masters, most die long before reaching the age of 10. Bogwiggles always have the same skin tone as the boggards with which they live-typically gray, green, or black. Just as with boggards, bogwiggles lose their coloring as they age, and particularly old bogwiggles are often a pale gray, almost white color. The average bogwiggle measures just less than 3-1/2 feet long, not counting the tail. Most weigh roughly 65 pounds, but bogwiggles of much larger size have been reported. Ecology Like their boggard kin, bogwiggles begin life as nothing more than tadpoles, and born into the same stagnant pools. These degenerate and malformed boggard kin are victims of a form of targeted infanticide that transforms them into their current forms. As the tadpoles begin to mature, the priest-king keeps a watchful eye over the birth ponds, looking for any sign that one of the tadpoles is stronger and more dominant than the others and could pose a threat to his rule. When the tadpoles begin the transformation into mature boggards, the priest-king feeds the dominant tadpole a toxic mixture of fermented swamp vegetation and crushed red beetles that stunts its metamorphosis, causing it to mutate into a bogwiggle. This process of intentional contamination renders the bogwiggle sterile. After a few months, it becomes clear to the caretakers of the birth pools that the stunted tadpole will never mature into a regular boggard. At this point, the bogwiggle is removed from the pool and treated as nothing more than a common animal. Most often, the priest-king or his minions take these abhorrent creatures in and train them as vicious guard and hunting animals. Gathered together with others of their kind, bogwiggles create packs that defer to the priest-king or their trainer as the alpha of the group. Bogwiggles are most often trained to guard the priest-king, his valuables or home, and the village as a whole. After bogwiggles reach full maturity at the age of 10 months, they finish their training. For the remainder of their short and violent lives, they hunt with boggards around the village and guard their master's belongings. Bogwiggles are omnivores, but greatly prefer flesh over algae and water plants. Bogwiggles have a particular taste for insects and the flesh of humanoids. While hunting, a bogwiggle pack functions similarly to a pack of dogs or wolves. Using stealth and their increased mobility in their swampy homeland, bogwiggles surprise their foes and attack with full force. Usually a number of bogwiggles single out an individual creature, trap it with their tongues, and use their strong jaws to finish it off. After the kill, bogwiggles prefer to allow the flesh to fester in swamp water for a few days before consuming it. Habitat &amp; Society Bogwiggles are found anywhere that their fully matured kin live, typically in temperate swamps, but occasionally in warmer climates such as those of tropical rivers and rainforests. Bogwiggles live within boggard communities, and are often found patrolling the perimeter around the primitive mud-huts that make up boggard villages. Usually, but not always, bogwiggles move freely through the village, living as pets and protecting certain homes and the birthing pools. One bogwiggle pack always stands guard inside the boggard priest-king's mound, watching the priest-king's consorts and valuables. Bogwiggle society, if it can be called such, is symbiotic with the boggards' own society. The boggards tolerate the existence of these "runts," and keep them as loyal companions as long as they serve their purpose. If the boggards find the bogwiggles to be detrimental to the community, they kill the blighted creatures and feed the corpses to the other boggard tadpoles maturing in the birth pools. Considered animals and unfortunate mutations, bogwiggles rarely fill roles with any responsibilities beyond hunting and protection, and even then they are supervised by mature, normal boggards. Variant Bogwiggles As with boggards and the amphibians they are related to, bogwiggles are highly sensitive to their environments, and have varying appearances and abilities based on the region they are found in. Additionally, bogwiggles can have differing abilities based on exactly when in the transformation from tadpole to boggard they were stunted. Some develop painful, piercing croaks that can stun a human into submission, some have two sets of legs, and others have only tails. Still others have poisonous flesh, or can even spread filth fever through their bites. Croaking Bogwiggle (CR +0): These variant bogwiggles can produce loud and terrible croaks capable of stunning their enemies, much like their fully-developed kin. Because of how these bogwiggles developed, they lack the sticky tongue special ability. Any non-boggard creature within 30 feet of the bogwiggle must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. This effect can be used once every hour. Creatures that succeed at this save cannot be affected again by the same bogwiggle's croak for 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based. Filthy Bogwiggle (CR +0): Raised from tadpoles in putrid pools stewed with waste and stocked with rancid meat, these bogwiggles spend their lives surrounded by disease. As such, filthy bogwiggles possess an immunity to disease and their bite has the potential to inf lict their targets with filth fever (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 557). Poisonous Bogwiggle (CR +1): Some bogwiggles that are raised in especially toxic pools of water (a careful mixture monitored by their fully developed kin) develop their own poison glands that secrete a slimy poison that coats their skin and is infused in their flesh. Any creature that touches a poisonous bogwiggle or hits it with a natural attack risks poisoning itself. Bogwiggle slime does not affect boggards or boggard kin. In addition, poisonous bogwiggles are immune to poison of all kinds. Bogwiggle Slime: Skin-contact; save DC 11; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d2 Dex; cure 2 consecutive saves.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Ablative Adaptation (Su) As a standard action, the Grand Defender can cast off its outer layer of metal, revealing a slightly smaller version of itself underneath. This new form may be made of cold iron, mithral, or iron, and its appearance may change with each use of the ability, altering its apparent genders, hair style, and so on. In its cold iron form, the Grand Defender's DR changes to DR 15/cold iron and its attacks count as cold iron for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. In its mithral form, its DR changes to DR 15/silver and its attacks count as silver. In its iron form, its abilities revert to normal. If the herald is brought to 0 hit points, it becomes inert; 1d4 hours after it last took damage, it sheds its outer layer and reanimates at half its normal hit points. Regardless of how often it uses this ability, the herald never changes size categories, as if it slowly grows to its normal size between transformations. Once shed, the outer layer decays into worthless powder 1d4 minutes after the transformation, though before this occurs it can spend 1 full round consuming the discarded metal to recharge its hammer storm ability. Breath Weapon (Su) As a free action once every 1d4+1 rounds, an iron golem can exhale a 10-foot cube of poisonous gas that persists for 1 round. Any creature within the area when it is exhaled (as well as any creature that passes through the cloud during the remainder of that round) is exposed to the cloud's poisonous effects. This poison is magically created each time the golem uses this power. Breath weapon-inhaled; save Fort DC 19; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1d4 Constitution damage; cure 2 saves. The save DC is Constitution-based. Defender's Shield (Ex) The Grand Defender's shield is a +3 heavy steel shield, though it becomes nonmagical if the herald is destroyed or is no longer holding or wearing it. Dwarf Traits (Ex) The Grand Defender has the following dwarven racial traits: defensive training, hardy, hatred, stability, stonecunning, and weapon familiarity. Hammer Storm (Ex) Once per day as a full-round action, the Grand Defender can expel a volley of warhammers from its mouth in a 30-foot cone that deals 15d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 19 half). If the herald is in its cold iron or mithral form, these hammers count as cold iron or silver. The Grand Defender can exclude any number of squares in the cone's area, preventing the hammers from striking those squares. The attack also counts as an awesome blow, though the Defender makes a single combat maneuver check, applying that result to the CMD of all creatures in the area, and affected creatures can only be knocked directly away from the Defender. The hammer storm actually creates 24 physical warhammers that persist after the instantaneous attack and may be used by creatures (though they are normal warhammers, not masterwork, cold iron, or mithral). The Grand Defender can spend 1 minute eating 24 warhammers (or an equivalent amount of metal) to recharge this ability. Immunity to Magic (Ex) The Grand Defender is immune to spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance. Certain spells and effects function differently against it, as noted below. • A magical attack that deals electricity damage slows the Grand Defender (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw. • A magical attack that deals fire damage breaks any slow effect on the Grand Defender and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the herald to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. The Defender gets no saving throw against fire effects. • The Grand Defender is affected normally by rust attacks, such as those of a rust monster or a rusting grasp spell.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Created by Torag to serve as his herald, the Grand Defender is a powerful golem animated by the collective will of dozens of great dwarf heroes. The heroic souls within the golem consider it an honor to lend their knowledge and love of battle to this mighty shell so it can protect dwarves in the mortal world. These heroes control the golem for anything from a single manifestation to several consecutive months of tasks, and afterward return to their reward in the afterlife. These multiple identities contribute to its varying appearance in each incarnation, even changing its apparent gender. The above statistics describe a typical manifestation of the herald, though if it is summoned for a specific purpose, the individual spirits within might have greater knowledge pertaining to that purpose. In general, the herald is friendly toward followers of Torag and focused on defending individuals or communities. Ecology The spirits within the Grand Defender retain all their mortal memories and knowledge, and when in the mortal world they have been known to recognize or call out through the herald to old friends, relatives, or offspring with an unexpected familiarity and affection. If visiting a place one of its spirits had been as a mortal, the golem might know secret exits or caches of materials long forgotten by the current inhabitants. Without the heroic spirits, the herald barely has a will of its own and acts in a programmed fashion like a common iron golem; however, Torag never sends it to the Material Plane that way, and existing knowledge of its "empty" state only comes from rare visitors to Torag's planar realm who encountered the herald. As a construct controlled by dead heroes, the Grand Defender has no need for rest or sustenance. However, the controlling spirits may enjoy the company of other creatures, and the golem can consume materials, though its sense of "taste" is certainly altered to suit its magical abilities. For example, most of the heroic souls report mild intoxication after eating metal in order to recharge the hammer storm ability. Habitat &amp; Society Since followers of Torag respect the knowledge of crafting and defense, most are in awe of the herald for having multiple lifetimes of learning and experience. In idle times before or between battle, mortal dwarves have been known to ask it for lost secrets of forging and engineering, and the hero spirits have Torag's permission to pass on this lore as long as doing so doesn't hinder his herald's purpose for that visit. Other dwarves hope to speak with a dead ancestor in order to pay their respects, apologize for some old offense, or recount a descendant's achievement. In this capacity, the Grand Defender takes on a role similar to an oracle or spirit mediator for ancestor-worshiping cultures, acting as a bearer of messages to the afterlife and strengthening a community's connection to its past. Because of these connections, Torag prefers to include spirits with ties to the intended community or location rather than members of a rival clan or outspoken heroes whose opinions and prejudices have grown less quaint and more embarrassing over the centuries.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Alert (Su) A bronze sentinel can take simple orders and identify intruders, and it possesses the ability to alert its creator or another creature to which it's keyed. When a bronze sentinel detects a trespasser, it can choose to alert the creature to which it's keyed in one of two ways. The sentinel can create a loud sound like that of a bell, chime, or gong that can be clearly heard at a range of 500 feet. Alternatively, a bronze sentinel can send a mental alert to the creature to which it is keyed as long as that creature is within 1 mile of the sentinel. The mental alert wakes the keyed creature from sleep, but doesn't affect normal concentration. A bronze sentinel's creator is the first creature to which it is keyed, and the creator can pass its link to another creature as part of a 4-hour ritual that uses materials costing 500 gp. Fiery Bolt (Su) As a standard action, a bronze sentinel can fire a bolt of flame as a ranged touch attack out to a maximum range of 30 feet. This bolt deals 1d6 points of fire damage. Immunity to Magic (Ex) A bronze sentinel is immune to spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance, save for spells with the electricity descriptor.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Bronze sentinels were among the most common of Thassilonian sentinels, and saw widespread use in ancient Bakrakhan and Eurythnia. Thassilonian nobles and wizards used these creatures to protect their goods, magical laboratories, and libraries. A bronze sentinel's fiery bolt burns hot, but its flames are short lived. This construction is in place to minimize the risk of the sentinel setting fire to the very things it is set to protect.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Alert (Su) A marble sentinel can take simple orders and identify intruders, and it possesses the ability to alert its creator or another creature to which it's keyed. When a marble sentinel detects a trespasser, it can choose to alert the creature to which it's keyed in one of two ways. The sentinel can create a loud sound like that of a bell, chime, or gong that can be clearly heard at a range of 500 feet. Alternatively, a marble sentinel can send a mental alert to the creature to which it is keyed as long as that creature is within 1 mile of the sentinel. The mental alert wakes the keyed creature from sleep, but doesn't affect normal concentration. A marble sentinel's creator is the first creature to which it is keyed, and the creator can pass its link to another creature as part of a 4-hour ritual that uses materials costing 500 gp. Immunity to Magic (Ex) A marble sentinel is immune to spells or spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance, save for spells with the force descriptor. Paralyzing Bolt (Su) As a standard action, a marble sentinel can fire a green-hued bolt of energy as a ranged touch attack out to a maximum range of 30 feet. A creature struck by this ray must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Marble sentinels were prized for their ability not only to detect intruders, but also to restrain them with paralyzing bolts. This ability only lasts temporarily, so the creator or other creature the sentinel is keyed to would have to receive the alert and mobilize her guards to properly subdue and restrain any trespassers. Construction Though the exact process of creating the base form differs depending on the materials involved, the process of animating sentinels is roughly the same. Each sentinel must be carved or worked to a fine detail before being subjected to spells and magical unguents worth 1,000 gp.

    <Source>Artifacts &amp; Legends</Source>
    <IsTemplate>0</IsTemplate>
    <SpecialAbilities>Immortal Structure (Ex) Reducing the Dancing Hut to 0 hit points causes its legs to buckle, bringing the hut itself toppling to the ground. Such a defeat has no effect on the hut's extradimensional interior or any creatures inside the hut. The hut remains immobile and unresponsive to its owner's commands to move or use any of the special abilities described in its creature stat block for 24 hours, though the transportive abilities of the hut and its cauldron can still be employed. The hut cannot be reduced to fewer than 0 hit points, no matter what damage, circumstances, or environment it might be subjected to after its defeat. After 24 hours, the hut regains half its hit points (94 hp) and its fast healing ability reactivates. It may then use its special abilities to escape from nearly any situation it finds itself in. The Dancing Hut can only be destroyed by the method detailed in the artifact's destruction entry. Swallow Whole (Ex) If the Dancing Hut successfully grapples a creature with its slam attack, the victim is scooped up by the hut's front door and flung inside. The target appears within the extradimensional space inside the hut-the layout of which depends upon the hut's physical location (see the map on page 23 for a sample layout of the hut's interior). Being inside the hut is not necessarily dangerous, unless one of Baba Yaga's guardians is there or Baby Yaga herself is home. A swallowed creature can attempt to escape by breaking open the front door, a deceptively sturdy barrier with hardness 15 and 100 hit points that also benefits from the hut's fast healing ability. The hut can expel swallowed creatures as a full-round action, flinging them from its open door. It must make a combat maneuver check against creatures that don't wish to leave, with failure meaning the target is able to hold on to the pitching and warping interior. The hut may choose which creatures it wishes to expel and which to keep inside.</SpecialAbilities>

    <SpecialAbilities>Agile Grappler (Ex) A gylou does not gain the grappled condition if she grapples a foe. Tentacle Cage (Su) If a gylou successfully grapples a creature, she transfers that creature into her lower body's nest of cage-like tentacles. This works like swallow whole. The gylou's tentacles are AC 17 and have 18 hp for the purpose of an entrapped creature cutting itself out. A gylou's tendrils heal quickly, allowing her to use this ability 1 round after a creature cuts itself free.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Known as handmaiden devils, Mothers of Pain, and Maids of Miscarriage, gylous attend to the whims and schemes of Hell's few female overlords. Like manipulative matrons amid decadent mortal courts, these deceivers hide their fathomless evil beneath illusions of beauty, graciousness, and tradition. Gylous particularly loathe children. It's said that the persistent cry of a babe can sometimes cause these fiends to abandon their illusions and viciously attack. As greater devils, gylous can command many lesser devils, yet harbor an exclusive favoritism for erinyes. A gylou weighs 160 pounds and stands stiff ly at 5-1/2 feet- though many wear their head-sprouting tentacles in tall, elaborate coiffures.</Description>

Create Shadows (Su) Any creature slain by an ancient or older umbral dragon rises as a shadow (if 8 HD or less) or greater shadow (if above 8 HD) under the umbral dragon's control 1d4 rounds later. Energy Drain (Su) A great wyrm umbral dragon deals 1 negative level with each successful bite or claw attack (1 level, DC 32). Ghost Bane (Su) A young or older umbral dragon's physical attacks deal damage to incorporeal creatures normally. Umbral Scion (Ex) Umbral dragons have negative energy affinity and are immune to energy drain and death effects. Shadow Breath (Su) Three times per day, an adult or older umbral dragon can breathe a cone of shadows. Creatures who fail a Fortitude save are blinded for 1d4 rounds and take 1 point of Str drain per age category possessed by the dragon. A successful save negates the blindness and reduces Str drain to 1d4 points. Spell-Like Abilities (Sp) An umbral dragon gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will (unless indicated otherwise) on reaching the listed age category. Young-darkness; Juvenile- vampiric touch; Adult-shadow walk; Old-project image; Ancient-finger of death (3/day), Great wyrm-shades.</SpecialAbilities>

    <SpecialAbilities>Shadow Blending (Su) Attacks against a fetchling in dim light have a 50% miss chance instead of the normal 20% miss chance. This ability does not grant total concealment; it just increases the miss chance.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Fetchlings are descended from generations of humans trapped on the Plane of Shadow. Infused with the essence of that plane, they are more and less than human, and often serve as middlemen in planar trade and politics. Other than their yellow eyes, their flesh has no color-it is either stark white, midnight black, or a shade of gray. On the Material Plane, they conceal themselves with heavy clothing or dim light so they can work without prejudice. The name "fetchling" is a human word; their own name for their race is kayal, meaning "shadow people." A fetchling stands 6 feet tall, but is generally lithe and wiry of frame, weighing only 150 pounds. Fetchlings live as long as half-elves. FETCHLING CHARACTERS Fetchlings are defined by their class levels-they do not possess racial HD. They have the following racial traits. +2 Dexterity, +2 Charisma, -2 Wisdom: Fetchlings are quick and forceful, but often strange and easily distracted by errant thoughts. Darkvision: Fetchlings see in the dark up to 60 feet. Low-Light Vision: Fetchlings can see twice as far as humans in conditions of dim light. Skilled: Fetchlings have a +2 racial bonus on Knowledge (planes) and Stealth checks. Shadow Blending: See above. Shadowy Resistance: Fetchlings have cold resistance 5 and electricity resistance 5. Spell-Like Abilities (Sp): A fetchling can use disguise self once per day as a spell-like ability. It can assume the form of any humanoid creature using this spell-like ability. When a fetchling reaches 9th level in any combination of classes, it gains shadow walk (self only) as a spell-like ability usable once per day, and at 13th level, it gains plane shift (self only, to the Plane of Shadow or the Material Plane only) usable once per day. A fetchling's caster level is equal to its total Hit Dice. Languages Fetchlings begin play speaking Common. A fetchling with a high Intelligence score can choose any of the following languages: Aklo, Aquan, Auran, Draconic, D'ziriak (understanding only, cannot speak), Ignan, Terran, and any regional human tongue.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Advanced Hive Mind (Ex) As long as there are at least two chrestomaths or caulborn within 300 feet of each other, if one creature in the group is aware of a particular danger, they all are. No creature in the group is considered flanked or flat-footed unless all of them are. Cooperative Scrying (Sp) Three or more caulborn or chrestomaths who maintain physical contact can scry on a place or creature as if using the scrying spell (DC 20), but with no limit to the spell's duration so long as at least three of the participants involved continue to touch and concentrate. This ability functions at caster level 7th (or at the highest caster level available to the most powerful participant in the group). The save DC is Charisma-based, adjusted by the modifier of the participant with the highest Charisma score. Mind Flood (Su) A chrestomath can target any creature it detects with its thoughtsense ability with a deadly psychic attack, flooding the target creature's head with so much obscure knowledge that it drives the target insane. Any creature affected by the mind blast must make a successful DC 19 Will save or take 1d6 points of Intelligence and Wisdom damage and be confused (as per the spell confusion) for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Intelligence-based. Psychic Deflection (Su) A chrestomath adds its Charisma modifier as a deflection bonus to its AC. In addition, all caulborn (though not other chrestomaths) within 300 feet of a chrestomath gain half of this deflection bonus as well, with the effects stacking with those from other chrestomaths and the caulborn's own psychic deflection ability. These bonuses cease when the chrestomath is unconscious. Racial Memory (Ex) As a full-round action, any caulborn within 300 feet of a chrestomath may access the latter's racial memory to gain half the chrestomath's Knowledge skill bonus as a bonus on its own Knowledge check. In addition, the chrestomath instantly acquires any piece of information learned by any caulborn that comes within 300 feet of it. This information may then be shared by any other caulborn and chrestomaths with 300 feet. Thoughtsense (Su) A chrestomath notices and locates living, conscious creatures within 60 feet just as if it possessed the blindsight ability. Spells such as nondetection or mind blank make an affected creature undetectable by this sense.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The caulborn are a race of extraplanar scholars that wander between worlds in search of esoteric knowledge, literally consuming the thoughts and memories of other races. While the most common caulborn are the humanoid versions (Bestiary 3 48), there exists a second kind as well: the bloated and blind intelligences called chrestomaths, sometimes referred to as living libraries, or simply "brain-sacks." Though they appear to be little more than giant amoebas barely able to move themselves, chrestomaths are a vital part of caulborn society. From their fleshy prisons, these powerful psychic intelligences help to shield and organize their humanoid servitor-siblings, occupying a position in caulborn society somewhere between brute resource and honored elder-and sometimes something close to a living divinity. Even more importantly, however, chrestomaths are the keepers of a caulborn hive's massive racial memory, the living storehouses of everything its members have ever experienced, as well as the memories and concepts they've stolen from others. Indeed, it's possible that the memories contained within a single chrestomath may stretch back millennia, all the way to the race's mysterious origins. A typical caulborn chrestomath is a wet, squishy sack of flesh roughly 5 feet in diameter, and weighs 500 pounds, though older and more advanced versions can grow far larger, taking up entire buildings with their fetid bulk. These more advanced versions sometimes appear almost larval in form, and may possess levels in spellcasting classes, using spells such as mage hand to affect their surroundings. Ecology Every caulborn colony has at least one chrestomath, but these creatures are made, not born. When a colony finds reason to split, or a small group becomes large enough to warrant it, the caulborn select several of their own members via criteria unique to each colony. These chosen individuals are promptly disassembled and rendered down in a solemn ritual, their living organs melded together into a single blob of curdled flesh. The resulting protoplasmic sack has no outside sensory organs or useful manipulating appendages, only a massive intelligence whose psychic abilities increase even as the world around it loses relevance, the isolation honing its intellect. Once the brain sack is complete, the caulborn seed it with every fact and record at the colony's disposal, usually copying knowledge over from other chrestomaths. Though their psychic abilities give chrestomaths the ability to float sluggishly through the air, most caulborn consider this a waste of the organic thinking machines' time, and instead assign teams of humanoid caulborn to carry the living data centers around in palanquins or set them up in vast chapels. Chrestomaths are completely dependent on their kin for survival. Just as normal caulborn consume the psychic energy of other races through stolen ideas and concepts, chrestomaths are unable to feed directly from the source creatures, instead requiring their less intelligent brethren to regurgitate the predigested knowledge for them, sometimes also injecting them with additional nutrients and magical concoctions. While any caulborn within range may access a chrestomath's memory, this information can be devastating to other creatures. In addition to its normal telepathy and mind-reading, a chrestomath confronted with dangerous creatures can establish a psychic link through which it pushes huge amounts of information. The recipients of this attack find their brains overloaded by the tidal wave of knowledge, rendering them catatonic or violently insane. Habitat &amp; Society While most chrestomaths have very little personality, any traces of identity being consumed by oceans of information, some eventually grow to control the data stored inside them and reestablish some semblance of self. One of the best such examples is Anamnesis, the One That Watches. As the heart of Xavorax, the city of caulborn and vampires deep below Kaer Maga, Anamnesis may well be one of the most learned entities on the face of Golarion, its thoughts and motives far beyond human comprehension. To outsiders, the thousands of pounds of flesh might seem barely sentient, capable only of shifting its colors to reflect emotions. Yet whether it's slave or master-or perhaps both-the lord of the Quivering Palace influences all the residents of Xavorax, watching over them as the central relay of their hive mind and the repository of all their race holds dear. While parasitic by nature, caulborn are not necessarily predatory, and aren't above trading for the sustenance they need. When they do so, it's often as prophets, a role in which chrestomaths are singularly important. Left with nothing but godlike memories and an ability to analyze information, chrestomaths are often able to extrapolate from trends and make logical connections that result in uncannily accurate predictions about future events.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Advice (Ex) Clockwork familiars have an innate understanding of how things work, granting their masters a +2 bonus on all Craft and Use Magic Device checks. Item Installation (Ex) Each clockwork familiar is made with the ability to carry a specific type of magic item inside its body. This item type is chosen at the time of the construct's creation, and cannot be changed. While the creature cannot activate or use the item for its original function, it gains certain constant abilities from the resonant magic fields, and can drain the item's magic as a free action in order to gain additional magical effects. In addition, any clockwork construct can drain a single charge or spell level from its installed item to heal itself 1d6 hit points as a standard action. Removing a spent item and installing a new one is a full-round action. Potion: The clockwork familiar gains a constant protection from good/evil/law/chaos effect (one type only, chosen each time a new potion is installed). In addition, a clockwork familiar can drain the magic from the potion in order to gain the ability to include in the effect a single creature whose shoulder it's perched on. While perched on a character's shoulder, it acts like a worn object with no body slot. While the familiar can move from person to person, thus transferring the benefit, latching on or unlatching from a shoulder is a move action. This ability to include others in the protection effect lasts for 1 minute per spell level of the potion drained. Scroll: The clockwork familiar gains a constant detect magic effect as a spell-like ability. Draining magic from a scroll allows the familiar to cast a single identify spell on behalf of its master for each spell level of the spell inscribed on the scroll-these castings may be stored and saved, though a scroll used in this manner becomes instantly useless, even if not all spell levels have been drained. Wand: The clockwork familiar gains the ability to spit a gobbet of acid up to 30 feet as a ranged touch attack, dealing 1d4 points of damage. Draining a charge increases the damage to 2d4 points for a single attack. This charge is spent before the attack is rolled.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>When it comes to familiars, most arcanists satisfy themselves with mundane creatures such as rats and lizards. Those with the power to bind greater assistants often call forth helpers from the planes, turning minor fiends or celestials to their will. Yet for artificers and those who fuse magic with machinery, the best familiar is the one the caster creates herself, breathing life into a clockwork mechanism of her own design. Clockwork familiars can take a variety of forms depending on the whim of the creator. Most popular are tiny metal dragons, birds (especially owls and ravens), faceless humanoids, and spiders that run on clicking, needlelike legs, though practically any shape and material can be animated in this fashion. With its ability to generate electric shocks, a clockwork familiar can be useful in combat, yet it more often finds more use in the workshop, where its methodical thought processes and innate knowledge of mechanical systems allow it to offer valuable advice. In addition, each clockwork familiar has a unique relationship with a particular type of magic item, established at creation. When items of the chosen sort are slotted into the familiars-usually via a locking compartment, though some familiars simply drink potions, their metal stomachs becoming new receptacles- the familiars gain the ability to drain the magic back out of the items and turn it toward a different preset purpose, such as healing themselves or creating a specific spell effect. A typical clockwork familiar is roughly 2 feet tall or long and weighs 10 pounds. While the stat block here represents a raven familiar, and hence has a fly speed, other forms may trade this ability for a different form of movement, such as a clockwork piranha with a swim speed of 40 feet or a mechanical badger with a burrow speed of 10 feet. Ecology Clockwork familiars can be constructed from a wide variety of materials, the most common being adamantine, steel, and bronze. Though their bodies are often expertly crafted contraptions of gears, drive shafts, and even circuitry, a clockwork familiar is not simply a robotic wind-up toy, nor is its consciousness the result of elaborate programming. Instead, each construct is more like a vehicle for the tiny spirit that lives inside its heart. On their own, these flickers of consciousness-pulled from the fundamental animating energy of the planes-would have no real ability to affect their surroundings. Only through the specially attuned constructs created by arcanists do they gain the ability to truly live, and it's perhaps gratitude for this service that initially binds clockwork familiars to their creators. Once called into being and installed in its new vessel, a clockwork familiar's animating spirit controls its mechanical manipulators through tiny bursts of magical or electrical energy. As a result, most such constructs have conductive metal parts, and thus an instinctive fear of water and corrosion. Unable to heal naturally, clockwork familiars know that if their systems fail, they may never again be granted the chance to interact with the world. As a result, most clockwork familiars tend to be slightly paranoid and demanding when it comes to getting their masters to keep them in good repair, and it's not uncommon to find a clockwork familiar left to its own devices busily scouring rust from its shell, performing maintenance on itself, or attempting to improve the resilience of its basic functions. Habitat &amp; Society As created creatures, clockwork familiars have little society of their own, and tend to take on mannerisms and speech patterns similar to their masters'. Most feel an instinctive affection for their masters, though as intelligent beings it's not unheard of for the little automatons to have existential crises if their masters mistreat or ignore them. Clockwork familiars are often fascinated by other construct creatures and may attempt to befriend or study them, the better to understand how their systems work. Though they rarely adopt religion on their own, familiars with religious masters may go through the motions of worship as a way of honoring their place in the great chain of creation-left to themselves, clockwork familiars tend to be more interested in the systems and logic by which the natural world and planes operate than in particular entities, including deities. While clockwork familiars have little desire for treasure themselves, they understand its value in trading, and may snatch up worthwhile items either on behalf of their master or-if they're concerned about being provided for-as emergency funds with which to purchase information or repairs, or as fuel for their magic-draining abilities. Clockwork familiars value knowledge above all things, though they tend to focus on logic, mathematics, organizational systems, and new ways of seeing and interpreting the world rather than simple facts. In a clockwork familiar's eyes, an almanac is useless clutter, but a textbook on geometry or chemistry is worth more than a pile of gold. As intelligent creatures, clockwork familiars have an ambiguous relationship with the lives of servitude they're inevitably born into. For some, the philosophical quandaries are small and easily managed, as their creators treat them well, ask their opinion, share their stores of valuable knowledge, and may even come to love them. For others, whose masters see them as slaves at best and irritatingly imperfect projects at worst, only fear for their continued existence keeps the constructs in line. Many fall somewhere in the middle, and are interested in all the world has to offer even down to the mundanity of fetching and polishing, and thus are content to experience life on their masters' terms. A spellcaster of at least 7th level who takes the Improved Familiar feat can select a clockwork familiar as a familiar. Construction The creator of a clockwork familiar must start with crafted clockwork pieces worth 500 gp. Clockwork Familiar CL 12th; Price 14,500 gp CONSTRUCTION Requirements Craft Construct, geas/quest, make whole, creator must be at least caster level 12th; Skill Craft (clockwork) DC 20; Cost 7,500 gp</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Fear (Su) Each creature within a 30-foot radius that sees the fachen must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or be paralyzed by fear for 1d4 rounds. A creature that successfully saves is not subject to the same fachen's fear aura for 24 hours. This is a paralysis effect and a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. Incredible Balance (Ex) Despite its strange anatomy, a fachen is adept at keeping itself upright and out of danger. A fachen gains a +3 dodge bonus to AC and a +4 racial bonus to its CMD against trip combat maneuvers.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The fearsome fachen's terrifying visage stops the hearts of all but the most intrepid. Reports disagree on just what it is about the fachen that turns one's blood to ice-the single leg and foot that somehow don't affect the being's balance or speed, the seemingly too-strong arm jutting out from the center of the creature's torso, or the lone bulbous eye leering maliciously at its would-be prey. Though the fachen's grotesque approximation of a humanoid form could be enough to scare a traveler witless on its own, no single part of the abomination's appearance induces fear like that of its mouth, which spans the creature's face and is filled with a full row of long, sharp teeth. A typical fachen stands just short of 6 feet tall, and despite appearing to be half a person, weighs around 150 pounds because of its muscle mass. While it is not a very large creature, its fearsome composition increases its perceived presence. Ecology It is unknown how the first (or subsequent) fachens were produced. The studies performed on the few viable specimens successfully collected showed no anatomical means of reproduction, leading to a theory of otherworldly intervention. Fachens are carnivorous beings, and greatly prefer fresh humanoid meat over other, often more readily available fauna. Fachens will pass by a family of deer or a pasture full of cattle to sniff out and hunt a single humanoid. Fachens are not content with simply killing and eating their meal; they like to mutilate their prey as they ingest it, particularly if their food still holds on to the final traces of life and consciousness as the fachens' teeth pierce its flesh. Fachens' tendency to mutilate their victims and feed off the creatures' fear help to sate the rage simmering just beneath their surfaces-but only temporarily. Food alone will never sate this hatred. The source of the fachens' anger and hatred is unknown, perhaps even to them. Whether their eating habits actually alleviate the seething rage or merely cover it up, the fachens care not. Though not very intelligent, a fachen is relatively skilled when it comes to tracking prey, especially if it failed to catch a meal using ambush and scare tactics. Rage and hunger focus a fachen so intensely that it relentlessly tracks down any being that manages to get past it. Despite a physiology that should lead to problems balancing and getting around, fachens are accustomed to their weight distribution and single-appendage movement. They also have an instinctual ability to defend themselves by dodging. A fachen springs off with its single leg and foot at a high enough speed to keep pace with most bipedal creatures, and has an uncanny ability to jump. Fachens' movements add to the overall fear the creature exudes. Their strange but dexterous locomotion and the single-armed striking of their attacks frighten and bewilder those who engage the creatures. A fachen is not particularly careful or perceptive in the midst of a meal. Unless battling multiple targets from the outset, once a fachen takes down its prey, it focuses solely on that meal until it's had its fill of food and fun. A fachen takes its meal right where its prey drops, be it along some goat trail through the hills or in the middle of a high-traffic road. It takes no pains to hide the corpse of its kill after feeding, nor does it strip the body of valuables. It's content to leave the body in its final resting place and go off in search of water, more food, or a place to rest until its hunger and anger stir again. Habitat &amp; Society Fachens are solitary by nature; they hold no fraternal love for their ilk, and are just as likely to view them as prey as they would any other creature. They possess no special defense against the fearsome appearance of others of their kind, and this knowledge keeps them apart as well. Unfortunately, only a few warning signs alert one fachen that another is in close proximity. A mutilated corpse on or near a path serves as a warning between the monstrous beings, which are able to identify another fachen's handiwork with just a glance. A felled orchard can also signify a fachen's presence, if the remaining boles show signs of damage from the axes fachens prefer to wield. Fachens are most often found in areas of temperate climate, typically in hills or plains. They have no particular love or hatred for hot or cold climes, but find prey is easier to come by in areas with more moderate temperatures. Outsider of the moderate climates, more fachen are found in warmer climates rather than colder ones. A few may be found in truly harsh climates, but usually end up there after chasing prey for an extended time. Fachens are more likely to drift than to settle in any permanent home or lair. They track food as necessary and find new places to rest in close proximity to their latest kills. They tend to make camp near natural trails or roadways frequented by travelers to ensure a steady supply of meals. However, if a fachen finds a location that ends up being particularly rich in prey, it might attempt to locate a small cave, rocky overhang, or copse of trees to set up as a more permanent residence. However, any would-be treasure hunter who locates the lair of a fachen finds only squalor-any trinkets or treasures carried by a fachen's meal remain with the corpse. Rumors and myths about fachens are less prevalent in major cities than in small towns, villages, and farmlands. They know that the larger the population, the greater the chance of being put down by local authorities. Like with many other mythical monsters and beasts, tales of prowess and heroics in the face of fachens are often shared over pints of ale and around campfires, and tales of sightings-though hardly believed-are often good for a few free rounds at the local pub. Parents use fachen stories to scare unruly children into behaving or completing their chores. Despite the levity with which they tell tales or make warnings about fachens, residents of these outlying areas still make sure they aren't alone when traveling outside the known safe zones, especially if the trip requires passing through areas where there have been fachen sightings or activity. When the presence of a fachen is conf irmed outside a town or village, the bravest members of that society often band together to kill it or drive it off, knowing the danger of the beast. Yet even so, fachen trophies are rare-even dead, the creatures are frightening to look upon.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Disease (Ex) Pulsing Puffs: Puffball-injury; save Fort DC 18; onset 1 minute; frequency 1/day; effect 1d6 Dex damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. Pulsing puffs is a disease characterized by small, blue-white spores sprouting within a creature's wounds. These spores quickly grow into phosphorescent, domed mounds that pulsate and throb, eating away at victims' connective tissue, severely impairing them. Additionally, once a creature takes 7 points of Dexterity damage from the pulsing puffs, the domed mounds burst, releasing a 10-foot-radius burst of diseased spores. This effect lasts for 1 round. Any creature caught within the burst radius or that moves through it is exposed to the pulsing puffs disease. The save DC is Constitution-based. Fungal Alchemy (Ex) As long as he has access to his fungus garden, a polevik can craft any alchemical item with a Craft DC of 25 or lower without needing to pay a cost in gold pieces for raw materials. Items function normally but may have a different appearance. For example, materials usually stored in glass jars instead fill rigid spheres of plant matter. Puffballs (Ex) Poleviks have learned how to nurture myriad species of symbiotic fungi upon their bodies, and the most treasured of these are their deadly puffballs. Each 6-inch-diameter spherical fungus has a thorny internal stalk covered by a thin skin of spore-laden flesh. As a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity, a polevik can pluck and throw a puffball with a range of 20 feet. On a successful hit, the thorns expand and pulsate on impact, bursting through the flesh of the puffball. This inflicts vicious wounds and releases fungal spores that infect the victim with pulsing puffs. As soon as a puffball has been plucked, another grows in its place. Once a puffball has been plucked, it decomposes after 1 round, becoming inert. Putrefying Aura (Su) All unattended nonmagical food or liquid within the radius of a polevik's aura instantly rots or spoils. Attended nonmagical food or liquid within the aura receives a saving throw to resist this effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The secretive and suspicious poleviks cultivate gardens of fungi in deep bogs and caves far from civilization, jealously guarding the secrets of their fungal alchemy from the rest of the world. Once natives of the First World, they retain some of that plane's potent life energy, which specifically encourages the growth of fungi and molds. This enables them to turn their own spry and twisted bodies into fertile ground in which to cultivate their signature puffball weapons. Averaging a few inches shy of 4 feet tall and weighing approximately 115 pounds, individuals can vary in size depending on the number and size of fungal growths that they nurture upon their bodies. They rarely live beyond 300 years. Ecology Poleviks are omnivorous but prefer decomposing meat that is already furred with fungus or ripe with mold. They rarely go to the trouble of actively hunting food; instead, they scavenge the remains of small creatures that find their way into their lairs and fall victim to the dangerous plants and molds they cultivate. Although poleviks could subsist on the mushrooms that they grow, they consider it a terrible waste to use these mushrooms for something as prosaic as food. As with many creatures of the First World, their cycle of reproduction is somewhat bizarre; poleviks reproduce only after their death. As a polevik's body begins to rot, one of his unique fungal infestations begins to consume his flesh and eventually grows into a colony of large toadstools. After a period of 1 year, the stalk of the largest toadstool bursts open and gives birth to a new, fully grown polevik. While already possessing all the skills and abilities of his race, the newborn carries none of the memories of his progenitor. As a result, a newborn polevik knows nothing about the world beyond his immediate surroundings, and his paranoid nature gives him little desire to learn more. Instead, he begins to enthusiastically cultivate the corpse-grown fungal colony that gave birth to him, adding it to the fungal garden of his long-decomposed predecessor. Habitat and Society Poleviks are solitary and reclusive creatures who consider fungi and molds to be both their closest friends and their most treasured possessions. Though they are able to communicate with all types of molds and mushrooms, poleviks occasionally find fungi's limited frame of reference frustrating. This sometimes leads poleviks to associate with intelligent fungoid creatures such as leshies and myceloids, although they treat the former as servants and the latter as rivals. Most scholars agree that the poleviks were cast out of the First World, exiled for some ancient insult to one of the Eldest. Though scholars disagree on which of those unique beings the poleviks offended, evidence of polevik gardens has been discovered by travelers in the Hanging Bower of the Green Mother, leading to speculation that poleviks may have once been her servants. Exile may have stripped them of an unending existence in the First World, but the stability of the material world gives them ample opportunity to cultivate and experiment with their beloved fungal companions. It is for these experiments that they are widely hunted by wizards seeking obscure spell components, and by alchemists who wish to learn the secrets of the polevik's miraculous ability to mix fungi into concoctions that seem impossible to create outside of a laboratory. Fearful of the outside world, poleviks rarely leave their lairs, but creatures that find their way into a polevik's gardens face vicious opponents. While poleviks are dangerous on their own, their usual tactic is to lead interlopers within reach of the deadly molds and fungi with which they share their lairs. Most who seek poleviks fall prey to ascomoids, brown molds, phantom fungi, phycomids, violet fungi, yellow molds, and others long before they face the direct attacks of these obsessive fey. Puffballs The most treasured of a polevik's fungi is the puff ball. In addition to the standard puff ball, which is rife with the deadly pulsing puffs disease, poleviks cultivate certain other varieties, each with its own unique properties. Deathrot Spores: Despite their name, these black puff balls are no threat to living creatures. When applied to a corpse, they quickly consume the necrotic flesh, stripping all meat from the skeleton over the course of a minute. This ability to easily conceal the identity of a murder victim makes deathrot spores prized by assassins. These puff balls can also be brought to bear against certain types of undead. When hurled as a ranged touch attack against non-skeletal, corporeal undead, deathrot spores inf lict a -2 penalty to the creature's natural armor for 10 rounds. Flamequench Mushrooms: These dun-colored puff balls are grown from a species of brown mold. When thrown into a fire, the puffball releases spores that suck in the heat from their immediate area. This has the effect of completely extinguishing a 5-foot square of nonmagical fire.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Elephantine Ears (Ex) A panotti can flap its huge ears to fly awkwardly. A panotti can also wrap its ears around the length of its body for warmth and protection from the elements (similar to using a bedroll or heavy blankets), or use them as secondary natural attacks (as per wing attacks).</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The panotti are a race of humanoids that strongly resemble humans except for one startling difference: their enormous ears. A panotti's ears are attached to the side of their heads, like those of a human, but they remain connected to the body down to the neck. When at ease, the folds of their ears hang loosely, like an elephant's, but extend almost the length of their bodies. These sheets of hanging flesh and skin appear limp and superfluous, but appearances are deceiving. Panotti possess remarkably smooth muscle control along the upper ridges of their ears, allowing them to extend and control their ears at will. Even though panotti look ridiculous by most humanoid standards, the source of this ridicule offers them several distinct advantages. By flapping their ears, adult panotti can lift off, hover, and even fly. While in combat, a panotti can slam opponents with its ears to propel them away. Panotti's hearing is sharp enough to detect the presence of even an unseen adversary. Finally, panotti can wrap themselves up in their ears like a cocoon, staying warm on the coolest of nights. Some sages speculate the panotti originated in a kingdom that fell beneath a curse-though the panotti themselves deny it. The rare couplings between a human and a panotti usually result in panotti children. Culturally, the panotti are a reclusive people, preferring the company of their own kind- mostly due to the reaction they receive from other humanoids. Nevertheless, panotti are not a cruel or unkind race, and their culture is rich with music and storytelling traditions. They adapt to most classes with ease, but favor bard, fighter, and ranger. Treated with respect and dignity, panotti can be generous and steadfast allies. When treated as laughingstocks, however, panotti can become fierce, and they're naturally hearty and capable warriors. On Golarion, panotti live primarily in Casmaron and central Tian Xia, with a much smaller number residing in Avistan.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Gaze Weapon (Su) As a free action at the start of his turn, Yamasoth can gape his central maw wide to expose the horrific red eye lodged in what should be his throat. This gaze weapon has a range of 30 feet, and polymorphs creatures affected by it into giant vermin, animals, or magical beasts (Fortitude DC 37 resists). Yamasoth chooses what creatures to transform victims into as they fail their saving throws. This effect otherwise functions as polymorph any object (CL 20th), and is a polymorph effect. Yamasoth can keep his maw open for up to 3 consecutive rounds, after which his throat-eye closes and this gaze weapon cannot be used again for 1 minute. The save DC is Constitution-based. Horrific Appearance (Su) Creatures that succumb to Yamasoth's horrific appearance are stunned. At the start of each round thereafter, a creature stunned in this way can make a choice- fight the overwhelming chaos and horror and attempt a new DC 29 Will save to end the stun effect and act normally on that round, or accept the chaos into its soul and automatically succeed at the save to recover from the stun effect. This latter option immediately shifts the creature's alignment one step closer to chaotic evil. This shift in alignment can be fixed via atonement, but counts as a voluntary alignment shift for the purposes of atonement's material component requirements. A creature that becomes chaotic evil as a result of this also becomes a willing minion and ally of Yamasoth. Maw (Ex) Yamasoth's central maw is a primary attack that threatens a critical hit on a roll of 19-20. A creature hit by Yamasoth's maw while his gaze weapon is active takes a -4 penalty on its next saving throw against the gaze attack. Polymorph Plague (Su) Any creature that has been affected by one of Yamasoth's polymorph effects becomes "contagious." For 24 hours after the creature's initial transformation, any other creature that touches or is touched by the polymorphed creature must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the polymorphed creature's HD + the polymorphed creature's Constitution modifier) to resist polymorphing into a creature identical to the current form of the polymorphed creature. Qlippoth Lord Traits A qlippoth lord is a powerful and unique qlippoth that rules a significant portion of an Abyssal realm. Qlippoth lords possess the following traits. • Immunity to cold, death effects, mind-affecting effects, and poison. • Resistance to acid 30, electricity 30, and fire 30. • Horrific Appearance (Su) This ability functions similarly to the typical qlippoth ability, save that qlippoth lords' horrific appearances often create physical effects and changes in their victims. Despite these physical effects, a qlippoth lord's horrific appearance remains a mind-affecting effect. • Summon Qlippoth (Sp) Once per day, a qlippoth lord can summon any qlippoth or combination of qlippoth whose total combined CR is 20 or lower. This ability always works, and is equivalent to a 9th-level spell. • Telepathy 300 feet. • A qlippoth lord's natural weapons, as well as any weapon it wields, are treated as chaotic, epic, and evil for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. • Qlippoth lords can grant spells to their worshipers. Granting spells does not require any specific action on the qlippoth lord's behalf. All qlippoth lords grant access to the domains of Chaos and Evil; in addition, they grant access to two other domains and a favored weapon that vary according to each qlippoth lord's themes and interests. Tentacle Transformation (Su) At the start of every odd-numbered round, three of Yamasoth's tentacle tips transform into one of three different types of appendages-a serpent's head, a clawed hand, or a metallic blade. The three tentacles all change into the same type of attack, and the change persists for 1 full round, after which the three tentacles revert to normal tentacles on every even-numbered round. While transformed, the limbs make the following types of attacks instead of tentacle attacks. • Blade: talon +36 (3d6+13/19-20) • Clawed Hand: claw +36 (2d6+13 plus bleed damage equal to the damage dealt by the claw) • Serpent Head: bite +36 (1d8+13 plus poison: bite- injury; save Fort DC 37; frequency 1/round for 12 rounds; effect 1d4 Dex drain and slowed for 1 round; cure 3 consecutive saves)</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Yamasoth, known also as the Polymorph Plague, dwells in the endless cavern realm of Sekatar- Seraktis in the Abyss. Constantly at war with bickering balor lords and other powerful demons, Yamasoth has held his own as the lord of the Abyss's largest, most centralized region: the Kingdom of New Flesh. The "new flesh" in question consists of the qlippoth lord's subjects- men and women from countless worlds who may have been kings and queens at one time, but here are nothing more than base monsters, vermin, and beasts to serve at Yamasoth's whim. Some he feeds upon. Others he keeps for his harem. But the bulk of the denizens of the Kingdom of New Flesh are soldiers. In this army, other qlippoth serve as commanders and generals, particularly Yamasoth's favored minions, the gongorinans (see page 90). Unlike most qlippoth, Yamasoth does not necessarily prefer to kill but rather to transform. A human who sins and dies produces a soul that fuels the demonic horde, but a dumb beast or feral monster who dies is merely carrion. By transforming free-willed mortals into monsters, Yamasoth's Army of the New Flesh only becomes more capable of ending worlds. Yamasoth's centuries-long alliance with Runelord Alaznist may have eventually resulted in such an assault on Golarion, but the devastation of Earthfall ended those plans before Yamasoth's burgeoning realm could finalize its gestation-proof that even in the greatest of disasters, some good is wrought. Yamasoth's interest in transformations goes far beyond mere polymorphing. The qlippoth lord is also fascinated by the act of fleshwarping and reworking life into new forms of mutants. Rumors state that the nature of the experiments that take place deep in the Kingdom of New Flesh closely mimic those the daemons performed in the Abyss so long ago that resulted in the first demons. In fact, some dissident demonologists claim Yamasoth himself is a nascent demon lord, and is in fact that first, primal demon born of daemonic tampering with Abyssal quintessence and sinful souls.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Dazing Gaze (Su) As a standard action, a cephalophore can hold up its severed head to make a gaze attack that affects all seeing creatures within a 60-foot radius. These creatures must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be stunned for 1 round. Creatures that successfully save are instead sickened for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect, and the save DC is Wisdom-based. Dazing Strike (Su) Any creature struck by the cephalophore's slam attacks must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be dazed for 1 round. Those who save against this affect are instead sickened for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect, and the save DC is Wisdom-based. Shatter Weapons (Ex) Whenever a character strikes a cephalophore with a weapon (magical or nonmagical), the weapon takes 3d6 points of damage. Apply the weapon's hardness normally. Weapons that take any amount of damage in excess of their hardness gain the broken condition. Statue (Ex) If a cephalophore stands perfectly still, it is indistinguishable from a normal statue. An observer must succeed at a DC 20 Perception check to notice the cephalophore is alive. If a cephalophore initiates combat from this pose, it gains a +6 bonus on its initiative check.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Adventurers wandering among forgotten ruins, abandoned temples, or moldering graveyards may have a chance encounter with an enigmatic cephalophore standing watch over the site. At a cursory glance, these guardians appear to be looming statues of decapitated humanoids, their severed heads held aloft in a gruesome warning or cradled in their hands like a precious prize. To benign passersby, these marble constructs remain inert, their stone gazes producing only an unnerving sense of watchfulness. However, those who attempt to raid or desecrate the cephalophore's holy site quickly find that this seemingly immovable statue is anything but. Consequently, many adventurers and tomb raiders have come to see cephalophores as a type of good-luck omen, because when one finds a cephalophore, a dangerous and treasure-filled ruin-hopefully still unlooted-is surely not far away. Part guard and part trap, most of these hulking figures were constructed millennia ago to stand watch over culturally vital holy sites. Cephalophores are the perfect sentinels-they remain completely still, without fatigue or complaint, for centuries, until a specific set of circumstances triggers them. These triggers are far from universal, and each individual cephalophore has a different set of transgressions that it is constitutionally bound to prevent. For many, it's the perturbation of certain relics within its tomb or temple, but some cephalophores are bound to attack any who pass by without performing a now-long-forgotten ritual or incantation. A typical cephalophore stands 10 to 15 feet tall and weighs up to 4,000 pounds. Cephalophores are made of solid marble, which makes attacking them with standard weaponry inefficient at best. Ecology Cephalophores are intimately linked to specific tombs or temples, with each constructed to stand guard over a single location. While the ravages of time do little to diminish the single-minded dedication of these creatures, the sacred edifices to which they are bound seldom stand so firmly against the ages. Consequently, cephalophores are often found amid ruins or deep in the wilderness, standing vigilant guard over a site that has been long forgotten by mortal society. Many cephalophores lie buried beneath sandy dunes, overgrown by unchecked jungle foliage, or entombed within collapsed caverns. Not entirely immune to aging, cephalophores do decay very slowly, their marmoreal forms flaking and crumbling over centuries. This process is hastened in climates where exposure to local weather conditions is especially ruinous or erosive. It is for this reason that the majority of intact cephalophores are discovered in arid climates or enclosed habitats like caves or catacombs. This leads some to mistakenly believe these creatures prefer such environs. In reality, preference has nothing to do with it-they are simply better preserved in dry conditions. Cephalophores subjected to centuries of high winds or dripping water sometimes deteriorate into featureless columns, the details of their forms washing away with the elements. Consequently, those having come in contact with a malformed cephalophore often chalk up the encounter to a spiteful earth elemental, and have no idea how close they were to an ancient treasure trove or forgotten tomb. Habitat &amp; Society Designed to perform a single, lonely function and constructed to be mindless, cephalophores are not at all social creatures. Any vestige of identity the constructs have is left over from their makers, who designed them in accordance with the aesthetics of their own cultures. Most scholars of Golarion suspect the first cephalophores were constructed during the height of the ancient city of Ninshabur in present-day Casmaron, whose inf luence extended as far west as Ancient Osirion and present-day Taldor. These scholars also posit that the cephalophores were made in an attempt by the Ninshaburians to emulate the living monoliths of Osirion, with whom Ninshaburian phalanxes were likely to have come into contact. The Ninshaburian origins of the cephalophores are evidenced by both their appearance and their geographic locations. One obvious indicator of the cephalophores' link to Ninshabur is the facial characteristics of the animate statues. Many of the constructs feature stylistically arched eyebrows and ferocious grimaces, in keeping with the characteristics of many known Ninshaburian statues of lammasus and sphinxes. Further, the locations of known cephalophore sites are consistent with the territory of the once-inf luential empire. Though the highest concentration of cephalophores is undoubtedly in eastern Qadira, they have also been encountered throughout Andoran, Cheliax, Galt, Isger, Varisia, and even Nex in eastern Garund. Many of these territories were never officially conquered by the marauding Ninshaburians, but it's possible some of their cultural practices and techniques spread to other societies, prompting a variety of sects to create their own cephalophores. Scholars debate whether ancient cephalophores were originally statues, chiseled from stone and then imbued with deadly purpose, or whether they were once living creatures that were immortalized through some forgotten ritual. If it's true that the Ninshaburians were inspired by the divine guardians of Osirion, then it's likely both methods were used at different times. Rock carvings found in the abandoned temple complex of Tabsagal indicate that the characteristic decollation of cephalophores was tied to a ritual wherein highly venerated holy warriors (akin to present-day paladins or clerics) were offered near-immortality in exchange for their service to Ninshabur. The majority of the ritual seems to have consisted of oath-taking, wherein the terms of the heroes' guardianship were made clear. However, to seal the pact, these warriors were then required to offer their own heads in homage to their ancient gods. After their beheading, the soldiers' bodies rapidly turned to stone, and they were then moved to their eternal resting places as guardians of Ninshabur's holiest sites. A cephalophore's grisly pose is a perfect representation of the self-sacrificial zealotry of Ninshaburian warriors. Those who chose to become Ninshabur's longstanding holy guards forsook all freedom and everlasting rest to ensure that their empire's sacred artifacts remained unmolested. Those who would stir the dust of Ninshabur must risk the wrath of these ever-watchful martyrs and the single-minded dedication that drives them.

    <SpecialAbilities>Adaptable Life Force (Su) Any effect that heals living creatures and harms undead or heals undead and harms living creatures (such as cure spells, inflict spells, and channeled energy) always heals the herald, even if the source of the power intended to harm it. Contact Other Plane (Sp) This ability functions as the spell contact other plane, but the herald can only ask questions on the behalf of another creature, the questioner (not the herald) must make the Intelligence check (if any) to avoid losing Intelligence or Charisma, and the loss is permanent rather than temporary. Destructive Aura (Su) As a swift action, the herald can emit a 30-foot aura of destruction for 15 rounds per day. All attacks made against targets in this aura (including the herald) gain a +7 morale bonus on damage rolls, and all critical threats are automatically confirmed. These rounds do not need to be consecutive. Maddening Strike (Su) If the herald successfully hits a creature with its flail, as a swift action it may force the opponent to make a DC 25 Will save. If the creature fails its save, it is confused for 1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based. Madness (Ex) The herald uses its Charisma modifier on Will saves instead of its Wisdom modifier, and is immune to insanity and confusion effects. Only a miracle or wish can remove its madness. If this occurs, the herald gains 6 points of Wisdom and loses 6 points of Charisma; it automatically reverts to its insane state 1d10 minutes later. Telepathic Bond (Sp) This ability functions like telepathic bond, except any creature linked to the herald's disturbing thoughts takes 1 point of Wisdom damage every 10 minutes.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Groetus's herald is End's Voice, an enigmatic creature that is both more and less mysterious than its master. It looks like a giant shrouded figure floating above the ground, legless and faceless, wielding a heavy flail with ends made of glowing energy. Its visage is often confused with a reaping undead, though it is a living outsider and acts mildly insulted when others assume it to be otherwise. Its voice is hollow and distorted, as if echoing from the far end of a long metal tube, and colored with accents from ruined empires and dead languages. It rarely comes to Golarion, and for most of these visits it is merely a silent witness to a great slaughter upon the battlefield or the last gasp of a dying city, though it may strike out with its weapon or magic at a seemingly random wounded or dying target, as if making sure the creature dies as expected. The herald may be insane from associating with Groetus, but it has a clarity unknown to mortal worshipers of the God of the End Times; perhaps its vast knowledge somehow protected it from a truly insane fate, or its status as a herald may give it a kind of lucidity that pierces the fog of madness. It does not cackle at itself like a madman, respond to unheard voices, kill for pleasure, or exhibit any of a dozen other obvious signs of insanity typically exhibited by the mad followers of Groetus. Ecology End's Voice does not eat, drink, or breathe; it lacks a face or mouth, and cannot be bribed with food or pleasure. It acts like an unfeeling thing, more patient than a mountain, slowly scouring away at existence like the ocean's tide or a desert wind. It has no role in the creation of life, and does not seem to take any part in the cultivation or upbringing of creatures or civilizations. Though it is known to kill without being provoked, it only does so if the target has already suffered serious harm or is on the brink of death, and even these it may ignore; it has drifted over a bloody battle, passing hundreds of dying heroes and off icers, only to strike at a single common soldier before vanishing. Once, it killed a human woman moments after a diff icult but successful birth, and chose to spare the child. It acts in this callous way toward mortals, undead, outsiders, and even dragons, but never against mindless creatures or those with animal-level intellect. Perhaps these killings are the directive of Groetus, steering a soul's course in the afterlife or preventing some future event; perhaps they represent an obscure code, with the time of death and name of the deceased unlocking a cipher over the course of a millennium; or perhaps they are just random acts of violence, the only evidence of the creature's tightly suppressed lunacy. If attacked, End's Voice retaliates, though sometimes it ends combat simply by driving some or all of its opponents insane and then retreating. It may return to dispatch these defeated foes days, months, or years later, even on the victim's deathbed, or it may ignore them utterly and show no recognition if the healed opponents confront it again. When called by mortals, the herald demands specif ic deeds of death, injury, or property damage, for End's Voice always seeks to further the end of times. For example, it may ask that every third adult male in a village be branded on the face with a mysterious symbol, or that a prince with black hair be nearly drowned, or a castle's eastern wall be cracked but left standing. Usually, these acts have no apparent link to the needs of the herald's conjurer, and most create a series of events that takes years or decades to play out. It favors the burning of incense and exotic woods, lingering over the fragrant smoke and making strange contortions. HABITAT &amp; SOCIETY When not serving Groetus or called by the faithful to perform a specif ic task, the herald flies over the surface of Groetus's moon, pausing to alter parts of the writing on the surface or draw runes on a blank area untouched by the god's madness. Sometimes it can be seen curled up there on the moon or reclining somewhere on the Astral Plane as if sleeping, though the eerie being is clearly not at rest. It makes no gestures of friendship or comradeship toward other divine servants of Groetus, though it accepts their presence (and their insanity) as if used to them. On one occasion, it absorbed a servitor into itself, inhaling the creature like smoke, then expelling it a year later with no explanation or apparent harm to the creature.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Compel Courage (Ex) An ostiarius can inspire courage as a 5th-level bard using bardic performance, granting a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +2 competence bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls. This ability has a range of 50 feet and affects those creatures the ostiarius chooses who also willingly accept the benefits of the effect (no saving throw required). The ostiarius's performance compels creatures to perform at dangerous extremes. Any living non-outsider that benefits from this ability takes 1 point of bleed damage. A creature that accepts these benefits for multiple consecutive rounds gains additional points of bleed damage that stack with one another (to a maximum of 5). This is an audible, mind-affecting effect and can be countered by a bard's countersong ability. Shadow Traveler (Ex) When an ostiarius uses plane shift to travel to the Plane of Shadow, it arrives at its intended destination with complete accuracy. When an ostiarius uses shadow walk, it moves at a rate of 100 miles per hour. Unnerving Gaze (Ex) A creature that succumbs to an ostiarius's unnerving gaze becomes sickened for 1d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Ostiariuses mind the gate between the world of mortals and the endless excruciating delights of the Plane of Shadow. Their role is twofold: admitting their brethren to the Material Plane using their powers of extraplanar travel, and, more insidiously, convincing mortals to willingly journey with them to their shadowed homeland. They are the emissaries of their people, encouraging susceptible mortals to turn away from the tired philosophies of their dull traditions and dim imaginations and to embrace inconceivable possibilities in a realm of inscrutable darkness. Their guidance leads those they counsel to a path of taboo indulgences and selfish excesses, gradually indoctrinating them in the unsqueamish methods and gluttonous mindset of the kyton race. Eventually, when a mortal is deemed worthy- which is to say, irredeemably corrupted and likely having set others down the same path-the ostiarius leads her into the dark of the Plane of Shadow, where it and its kin gorge themselves upon this newly trapped scrap of flesh and thwarted expectation. An ostiarius might superficially appear to be of any gender or completely androgynous, often undergoing physical manipulation to present an appealing figure to those it would court. Extremes of exotic tattooing, piercing, or body modification often mark their forms, and some ostiariuses go so far as to fuse flesh, shining accoutrements, and dark clothing into a single epidermal layer. Most proudly stand over 6 feet tall, though their weights range from exceedingly light to grossly heavy due to interior cavities either scraped empty or filled with the most perversely beautiful but utterly superficial organs. Kyton Rhetoric Ostiariuses are infamous for their half-truths and honey lies. As the reputation of the kyton race does not lead most mortals-even those with the most stained souls- to embrace the pain-tasters' cruel mortal enlightenment, it falls to ostiariuses to turn minds against their own bodies, encouraging philosophies of suffering to take root and override their natural fear and revulsion of kytons' so-called "gifts." To such ends, ostiariuses claim absolute openness with those they court, and deftly-supposedly candidly-answer even the most pointed questions about their insidious natures. The following are just a few of the questions commonly put to kyton ostiariuses, and their well-rehearsed answers to each. Kytons are evil. Why should I trust you? "Evil? Such a small word to sum up my people, our culture, and our millennia-old dogma. I have little belief in the concept. I've seen holy men sacrif ice innocents and be called saints. I've seen mothers who stole only to feed their children go to the gallows. I perceive evil to be an artif icial construct, a mere description created by frightened clerks so they can determine whether one's actions fall within or outside their narrow visions for what reality should be. But am I evil? I believe in potential. I believe that some creatures are without signif icance and not worthy of my hand raised to save them. Conversely, I believe the multiverse blesses some beings with extraordinary traits, with the potential to do-to be-great things. The fact that I exist to seek out such potential and help it flourish means that regardless of what you believe about such small words like ‘good' and ‘evil,' inarguably the cosmos has guided me to you, and as I believe in the power of that cosmos, I believe in you." My magic says you're evil. Why shouldn't I slay you? "Pause to consider the source of that information. Something has told you that I am evil, and why wouldn't it? I seek to enlighten. To reveal secrets of reality, rebirth, immortality, and divinity that no creature that calls itself ‘good' would wish to see revealed. Surely my words are heresy in every faith where the blind follow the sighted, for I promise to reveal wonders inherent in every worthy soul, wonders the deities claim are theirs alone." Your race hails from the Plane of Shadow. Why do you dwell in such a terrible place? "My people seek to escape form, to escape prejudice, to escape all restrictions that wantonly encage us. To this end, my people voluntarily migrated to the one place in all existence where the body becomes muted, and voices, philosophies, and sensations are amplified. My people are ascetics, the darkness our endless meditation." Your people originated in Hell. Care to explain? "Surely you know there are angels as well as devils in Hell. In the home of the righteous, there must be a single law. All who refuse to bow to that law are rebels in the eyes of the empowered, and so must be outcast. Those who refuse to bend to righteousness-or worse, who hold their own visions of righteousness-are exiled to the burning hinterland. But, were my people prisoners of Hell, were we truly damned, could we have left so easily? My people have been pilgrims in many lands, and have come to understand many truths of the cosmos. Hell was merely the last of many realms through which we've passed." Your methods indulge in fear and suffering. Why would I embrace such destruction? "Pain. Sorrow. Fear. These are not emotions. These are instincts of animals, of lesser beings. Do you think the rat feels contentedness, the snake either love or lust, the sow ecstasy? We are without the vestigial mental ref lexes of mortals. Yet such enlightenment is not our purview alone. We would teach all with minds to understand how to be more than what an evolution of meat and tears would constrain. We offer possibility and revelations of enlightenment, states your kind are predisposed to distrust, to view as revolution, but which those with the potential for greatness clasp as rungs upon the ladder of exultation."</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Grave Dependent (Su) A kere is mystically bonded to a single gravestone-typically the most impressive or oldest in a graveyard-and must never stray more than 300 yards from it. A kere who moves 300 yards beyond her bonded grave immediately becomes visible and unable to use any of her spell-like abilities. A kere who is out of range of her bonded grave for 24 hours takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage, and another 1d6 points of Constitution damage every day of separation that follows-eventually, this separation kills the kere. A kere can break this bond or forge a new bond with a new grave by performing a 24-hour ritual and making a successful DC 20 Will save. If a kere is not bonded with a grave, she must either actively try to forge a new bond or attempt to return to the Boneyard (where she takes no penalties from not being bonded). Grave Meld (Su) A kere can meld with any gravestone or funerary sculpture, similarly to how the spell meld into stone functions. She can remain melded with such a structure as long as she wishes. Grave Tell (Sp) This ability functions as the spell stone tell, but only affects stone funerary structures, like gravestones, cemetery monuments, lych-gates, mausoleums, and similar constructions. Infectious Fear (Su) Any creature struck by a kere's shroud must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or become frightened for 2d4 rounds. Any creature that physically touches a creature frightened by this effect must succeed at a DC 20 Will save as well or also be frightened for 2d4 rounds (though the fear of the creature touched is not contagious). The save DC is Charisma-based. Shroud (Ex) A kere's shroud is an insubstantial thing that only a kere can touch. Creatures that come into contact with this shroud find it to be as insubstantial as mist-though they often do feel the terror it inspires. A creature that is unaware of a kere and is struck by her shroud is not aware that a weapon has struck it. A kere's shroud vaporizes upon its owner's death. Spiritsense (Su) A psychopomp notices, locates, and can distinguish between living and undead creatures within 60 feet, just as if she possessed the blindsight ability. Spirit Touch (Ex) A psychopomp's natural weapons, as well as any weapon it wields, are treated as though they had the ghost touch weapon special ability. Veil of Tears (Su) Any graveyard that hosts a kere is gloomier and more solemn. All exterior areas within such a graveyard are perpetually affected by darkness and mind fog (Will DC 20). Additionally, any undead creature that enters the area is also affected as per the spell slow (Will DC 20). Those who save against these effects are immune to the graveyard's veil of tears for the next 24 hours. Those who fail are affected by these penalties for as long as they remain in the graveyard. A veil of tears can be raised or lowered by the resident kere as a free action. The veil disperses if a kere leaves the graveyard or is destroyed, and rises upon her return. The veil can also be dispelled for 1 day by casting dispel magic or a similar spell upon the kere's bonded gravestone. The spell effects are cast at the kere's caster level (usually 11th). The saving throw DCs are based on the resident kere's Charisma.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Certain places are sacred, settings meant to remain free of the raucous sounds and defiling touch of the living. Graveyards number among some of the most obvious of such places, where stone guardians and the buried weight of the dead bear on visitors with undeniable gravity. But certain forces disregard the fundamental sanctity of such ground-mortal and deathless heretics who use such places to hunt, feed, or cloak fouler deeds. Yet not all cemeteries are unguarded, and the vaporous shadows and palpable dread of some burial grounds suggest not corruption, but the custody of an ominous otherworldly guardian. Keres, like all psychopomps, are emissaries of the Boneyard, the necropolis that all mortals must traverse at the end of life. While most psychopomps concern themselves with the souls of the recently deceased, keres mind the resting places of the dead. Their stewardship derives not from any otherworldly care for the deteriorating dust left in the wake of mortal life, but rather from an interest in those who come seeking the dead where they lie. Such creatures often engage in perversions keres seek to oppose. To this end, keres take up lonely residences amid the tombs and monuments of graveyards, spreading an ominous air and giving rise to tales of hauntings and strange encounters to deter even the boldest intruders from trespassing upon the fields they tend. Keres appear as pale, sickly women standing about 5 feet tall and weighing less than 100 pounds. Ecology As otherworldly natives, keres have little direct impact on the world of the living, but the atmosphere they intentionally create is undeniable. To deter the living from treading upon the cemeteries they mind, keres employ tactics similar to those of mournful ghosts and mythical beings from storytellers' tales of spirits and haunts. Their presence fills the area they guard with a palpable dread, and they fill these cemeteries with baleful howling, somber illusions, and glimpses of their own ghastly forms. While they rarely create phantasmagoric images of the undead- out of a loathing for such perverse creatures-their unsettling displays of dangerous animals, lost children, whispering plants, shuddering gravestones, living statuary, pale doppelgangers, unnatural weather, and other eerie phenomena are typically more than enough to give a graveyard a haunted reputation. Habitat &amp; Society A kere's exact methods usually matter little, as they tend to keep to more vulnerable, remote cemeteries, and prove most active when night cloaks the dark deeds of trespassers. But, occasionally, overzealous keres come into opposition with a fearful community and those sent to deal with the supposed haunting. Since their aloof nature causes them to avoid speaking directly with mortals, keres usually deal with would-be exorcists in the same manner they deal with other trespassers-by trying to frighten them away. Those who refuse to be frightened might be attacked, or faced with inquisitive illusions as a kere attempts to divine whether the interlopers are threats to her graveyard or not. More than once, a kere has been known to grow bored in her vigil and actively attempt to attract mortal visitants, but such attention-seeking psychopomps often find the added excitement isn't worth the bother. For all of the ambiance and grim reputations cultivated by keres, their primary objective upon the Material Plane is to preemptively thwart the deeds of necromancers and undead. To this end they terrorize grave robbers, harry the work of dark cultists, and openly attack the unliving. Any undead beings who enter or manifest in a cemetery under a kere's care find the weight of eternity crushing down upon them, making the most common sorts easy prey for these sentinel psychopomps. In some cases, though, more powerful undead might find ways to undermine a kere's defenses, or even drive her off. Such desperate keres have been known to grudgingly seek out aid, typically from the church of Pharasma or fringe-dwelling magic-users, in countering the taint of undeath.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Horrific Appearance (Su) Creatures that succumb to a gongorinan's horrific appearance become confused for 1d4 rounds. Oviposition (Su) A gongorinan can implant a stony egg the size of a human heart in the body of any Small or larger pinned, helpless, or willing creature as a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity. This action deals 1d4 points of Constitution damage to the victim. If the victim survives this damage, the egg takes root deep in the victim's body, links to his mind, and begins gestating. The egg grows rapidly, dealing 1 point of Intelligence drain every day to a minimum score of 1. Once this Intelligence drain affects a creature that already has an effective Intelligence score of 1, the egg "hatches" inside of the victim. This causes the victim to immediately transform into a horrid animal, aberration, magical beast, or vermin (the exact choice is made by the gongorinan according to its strange goals and unknowable desires), whereupon it begins living out its new life via pure instinct-this effect otherwise functions as if it were baleful polymorph to which the creature had failed its secondary Will save to retain its personality. A gongorinan can command the actions of a creature that has undergone this transformation as if the victim had been affected by dominate monster (this works even on creatures that are normally immune to such effects as a result of being mindless) as long as the gongorinan is within 120 feet of the creature. The effect can be reversed by break enchantment (DC 22-treat the gongorinan's Hit Dice as it caster level), but cannot be dispelled. Poison (Ex) Sting-injury; save Fort DC 22; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3 Strength damage and staggered for 1 round; cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The gongorinans are the spawn of the nascent qlippoth lord Yamasoth, although one could be forgiven for thinking them of them less as offspring and more as parasites. A gongorinan's basic shape resembles that of an immense, stocky crab, save that they lack all of the features crabs have adapted for an aquatic life-gongorinans are terrestrial creatures. A typical gongorinan possesses no fewer than a dozen stalked eyes, and is capable of extending these eyes from the upper edges of its body just above its mouth to a length of nearly 3 feet, giving it extraordinary vision in all directions. A gongorinan's mouth is a complex tangle of sliding plates and toothy ridges that rasp and shriek against each other as it speaks and chews, but despite their frightening shapes, these mouthparts are ill-suited for making physical attacks; the gongorinan relies upon its arms for that. Each gongorinan has four of these, and each arm is a different, highly specialized appendage. The humanoid arm is used for fine manipulation or the wielding of weaponry, while the mantislike claw is used to shred flesh and create deep, bleeding wounds. The needle-covered tentacle is used to sting and inject a painful poison to stagger foes, while the pincer is used to snatch and hold victims close for oviposition. A typical gongorinan stands about 6 feet tall and weighs 800 pounds. When at rest, a gongorinan retracts its limbs into its rock-encrusted body, allowing it to appear remarkably like nothing more than a large, misshapen boulder. Larger specimens known as elder gongorinans exist (and often possess additional and even more dangerous arms), but these are quite rare on the Material Plane save for in the depths of Hollow Mountain. Ecology All gongorinans carry within their bodies a brood of horrific egg masses, yet these eggs are not used for the propagation of their kind (that process is governed by a more traditional and yet more nightmarish method best left unspoken). Instead, these eggs carry within their stony shells a raw quintessence of the Abyss, infused with the ichor-seed of the gongorinans' lord, Yamasoth. Whereas most creatures are driven to breed and multiply, the gongorinans are instead driven to seek out humanoid hosts for their eggs. The implantation happens via the gongorinan's mouth and a hideous ovipositor that's not quite tongue and not quite toothed prolapsing throat, but something worse. Fortunately for most who might encounter a gongorinan, the process of oviposition leaves the horrid creature open to attack and cannot be performed quickly, yet to the lone adventurer caught and overwhelmed by a gongorinan, this is small comfort indeed. Once an egg has been implanted, it takes many days to grow, and the gongorinan prefers to carry the unfortunate host off to restrain it in a hidden location. Victims are often cocooned in webs or left stranded in high cavern ledges far above the ground so that the egg can gestate. As it grows, the egg feeds on the victim's mind, absorbing the victim's intellect until it has reduced the host to a drooling wreck. At this point, the egg doesn't hatch so much as it merely merges with the host, effecting a horrific and permanent transformation into a monstrous form. The gongorinan can inf luence this ultimate form as it lays its egg. It typically chooses powerful creatures that are already found in the region, for these "young" are loyal to their parent and serve as loyal guardians or playthings. Victims retain no true portion of their previous personality, but those who have been rescued from this horrific fate via powerful magic do retain memories of their time as a transformed monstrosity. Many never quite recover from these ordeals, and often develop a peculiar form of madness in which they regard their monstrous life as having been their true life, and their true life as the curse. The most despondent of these victims eventually seek the promise of peace through suicide rather than endure the dreams of their life as a monster-dreams that carry within them a most horrible longing. Habitat &amp; Society Gongorinans are an industrious and intelligent breed of qlippoth, and where they find themselves, they invariably form hive-like complexes to live in. These gongorinan "cities" are labyrinthine affairs with plenty of chambers for their transformed children to live in. In the Abyss, gongorinan hives can grow truly immense, with populations in the thousands, but even the Material Plane is no stranger to gongorinan hive cities. The largest of these hives are thought to be located deep beneath Hollow Mountain, where Runelord Alaznist lured the Polymorph Plague himself, Yamasoth, into dwelling for a time. While Yamasoth has long vacated the Darklands caverns under Hollow Mountain, they bear the name of his spawn- Gongorina-and his spawn dwell there still.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Constructed (Ex) For the purposes of effects targeting creatures by type (such as a ranger's favored enemy and bane weapons), androids count as both humanoids and constructs. Androids gain a +4 racial bonus on all saving throws against mind-affecting effects, paralysis, poison, and stun effects, are not subject to fatigue or exhaustion, and are immune to disease and sleep effects. Androids can never gain morale bonuses, and are immune to fear effects and all emotion-based effects. Emotionless (Ex) Androids have problems processing emotions properly, and thus take a -4 penalty on Sense Motive checks. Nanite Surge (Ex) An android's body is infused with nanites. Once per day as an immediate action, an android can cause her nanites to surge, granting a bonus equal to 3 + the android's character level on any one d20 roll; this ability must be activated before the roll is made. When an android uses this power, her circuitry-tattoos glow with light equivalent to that of a torch in illumination for 1 round.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Of the numerous wonders and horrors that emerge from the technological ruins of Numeria, the androids who periodically crawl from the wreckage are among the most eerie and amazing. Though they appear to be almost human, these artificial wonders are of a completely foreign and utterly alien nature. Androids are created, not born, and come into the world fully mature. The strange, alien "forges" in which new androids are created are hidden in strange ruins in Numeria, and most androids have little to no memories of these regions. Strange circuitry-like markings that look like faintly glowing tattoos, a faint metallic sheen to the eyes, and watery, almost translucent red blood are all ways to tell an android from a human-providing its awkward mannerisms haven't revealed the truth already. A typical android is 6 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds. ANDROID CHARACTERS (16 RP) Androids are defined by their class levels-they do not have racial Hit Dice. All androids have the following racial traits. +2 Dexterity, +2 Intelligence, -2 Charisma: Androids have swift ref lexes and are very intelligent, but have difficulty relating to others. Exceptional Senses: Androids have darkvision to a range of 60 feet and low-light vision. They also gain a +2 racial bonus on Perception checks. Constructed (2 RP): See above. Emotionless (-1 RP): See above. Nanite Surge (3 RP): See above. Languages: Androids begin play speaking Common. Androids with high Intelligence can choose any languages they want (except secret languages, such as Druidic).</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Razmiri Aversion (Ex) The Razmiri conditioning received in life is difficult for an apostasy wraith to overcome. If confronted by a Razmiri priest or anyone successfully disguised in that garb, the apostasy wraith must make a Will save. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 the Hit Dice + the Charisma modifier of the highest-level Razmiri priest present. The apostasy wraith needs to make this saving throw only once per encounter, regardless of the number of Razmiri priests present. If the saving throw fails, the apostasy wraith is forced to flee as if affected by the Turn Undead feat. If the save is successful, it overcomes its aversion and gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls and deals double damage against Razmiri priests (or those disguised as such) for the duration of the encounter. Rend Faith (Su) On a successful incorporeal touch attack against a foe with divine spellcasting abilities, the ability to channel energy, or other divinely granted special abilities, the apostasy wraith's inherent spite and contempt toward all things religious disrupts the target's connection with his deity. The victim must make a successful DC 16 Will save or be unable to use any such ability for 1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based. Sense Apostate (Su) An apostasy wraith can sense the presence and direction of Razmiri priests as if using the locate creature spell (CL 20th). This ability cannot be dispelled.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>When the souls of the followers of the Living God Razmir reach Pharasma's Court, most are bound for the Inner Court, where their ultimate fate as believers of a false god is decided. These mortal souls are so traumatized by the knowledge of the falseness of their faith that they know only the desire to avenge themselves upon those who so duped them in life. These souls disavow the legitimacy of all gods, and return to the Material Plane to sow their vengeance. An apostasy wraith exists in a state of constant conflict, torn between its burning shame at falling for such duplicity in life and its scorn and hatred toward believers for whom faith proved to be genuine. Their primary motivation is to wreak vengeance upon the false priesthood of Razmir, but that faith's mental conditioning is so effective as to make it difficult for an apostasy wraith to even approach its quarry. If able to overcome its aversion, its wrath is terrible. Otherwise, an apostasy wraith gladly vents its rage upon followers of other gods in an effort to make them see-even if only for a moment-the despair of finding one's faith misplaced.</Description>

This damage is doubled against creatures with no armor or natural armor bonus to AC, but creatures in heavy armor or with a natural armor bonus of +10 or greater are immune, as are creatures immune to critical hits or without flesh.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>In Osirion, these massive beetles are a threat to ancient tombs as they chew their way through the interred. Some say scarab beetles' connection with the dead gives them powers greater than those of normal beetles, but any evidence of this has yet to been proven true. Merchants claim powdered scarab is an essential element in magic that protects against death effects.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Pipes (Su) A satyr can focus and empower his magic by playing haunting melodies on his panpipes. When he plays, all creatures within a 60-foot radius must make a successful DC 18 Will save or be affected by charm person, fear, sleep, or suggestion, depending on which tune the satyr chooses. A creature that successfully saves against any of the pipes' effects cannot be affected by the same set of pipes for 24 hours, but can still be affected by the satyr's other spell-like abilities as normal. The satyr's use of his pipes does not count toward his uses per day of his spell-like abilities, and if separated from them, he may continue to use his standard abilities. The pipes themselves are masterwork, and a satyr can craft a replacement with 1 week of labor. The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The forest of Fangwood dominates the nation of Nirmathas. The country depends on the mighty wood for its security and economy, yet in its thick and shadowy depths lurks an oppressive curse. Where the pine trees grow tall and thick, the dryad Arlantia reigns. A pawn of the demon lord Cyth-V'sug, she is infected by the insidious tendrils of the Prince of the Blasted Heath. A magical breach forged by this curse connects the demon lord's realm, the Jeharlu, to Golarion and to the First World itself. Arlantia infects trees with demonic ichor that warps the fey creatures who reside in the heart of Fangwood, and she takes advantage of the conflict and war that wracks Nirmathas to create an army of thorn-crowned daughters and other rot-infested horrors to consume the forest from within. The blight manifests as a black and greasy fungal rot that moves and sways tree branches and limbs where no wind propels them, and a mystic network of fell power extends an unnatural awareness between nearby blighted fey. Dryads are by far the most insidious of the corrupted fey; they lure humanoids to literally and spiritually dark places to beget more daughters from their dark embrace- and further spread the disease. The dryads connect through a unified but tainted mystic field that transcends their ordinary limitations and permits them to treat every infected tree as if it were their own bonded tree. Only magic such as miracle, limited wish, or wish can sever the connection to the Jeharlu and cure a blighted fey. Some speculate that a magical linchpin exists within Fangwood, which if destroyed would end this hideous plague. CREATING A BLIGHTED FEY "Blighted fey" is an acquired template that can be added to any fey creature with 2 or more Hit Dice, referred to hereafter as the base creature. Blighted fey were once normal fey-a fey creature tied up and bound in the ropey vines of the blighted, tainted trees of the Fangwood acquires the blighted fey template by the next sunset. A blighted fey uses the base creature's statistics and abilities except as noted here. CR: Same as the base creature +2. Alignment: Chaotic evil. Senses: A blighted fey gains darkvision to a range of 60 feet if the base creature did not already have it. If the base creature already has darkvision, the ability is extended by an additional 30 feet. Armor Class: Natural armor improves by +2. Hit Dice: The base creature's racial Hit Dice change to d8s. Class Hit Dice are unaffected. Defensive Abilities: A blighted fey gains DR 10/cold iron and good; immunity to disease, paralysis, poison, and polymorph; and resistance to cold 10 and electricity 10. A blighted fey also gains spell resistance equal to 11 + its newly adjusted CR. A blighted fey also gains the following ability. Fungal Rejuvenation (Su): So long as it remains within 300 yards of any blighted tree within the Fangwood and remains standing on moist earth, the blighted fey gains fast healing 5. The infected tree need not be specifically bonded to the blighted fey for this ability to function. Special Attacks: A blighted fey gains the following special attacks. Unless otherwise noted, save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 the blighted fey's Hit Dice + the blighted fey's Constitution modifier. Parasitic Bond (Su): Once per day with a successful thorn throw attack, the blighted fey can transform the thorn into a burrowing, wiggling maggot that infests the target and infuses it with a short-term curse from within unless the target succeeds at a Fortitude save. This parasite creates an unholy link to the target, binding it to the blighted fey. This binding persists for 5 rounds, during which all hit point damage taken by the blighted fey is halved, and the target takes the other half of the damage dealt. The type of damage remains consistent with what the blighted fey receives. Only one parasitic bond can be maintained with one creature at a time. This bond counts as a curse and a disease. Thorn Throw (Ex): A blighted fey can shoot a fistful of needle-sharp thorns at a single target within 20 feet as a standard action. The thorn attack deals an amount of damage equal to a sting natural attack, with damage based on the blighted fey's size (see Table 3-1 on page 302 of the Bestiary), except the attack is resolved as a ranged attack instead of a melee attack. Special Qualities: A blighted fey gains the following special qualities. Cyth-V'sug's Unity (Su): Blighted fey within 100 feet of each other can communicate through a shared fungal hive mind. This does not permit blighted fey to see and hear through each other's senses, but they can share specific situational information and tactics through telepathy. If one blighted fey within range is aware of danger, they are all aware of danger and cannot be surprised. Daughters of Arlantia (Su): Fey creatures with close ties to a specific plant react differently to the blighted fey template. Blighted fey dryads are no longer dependent upon a specific tree. A dryad's tree dependent special ability is modified (but not replaced) so blighted fey dryads are required only to remain within 300 yards of any blighted Fangwood tree. This ability applies to blighted fey dryads only. Tainted Blood (Ex): A blighted fey's blood and flesh are rife with disease. Any creature that successfully makes a bite attack against a blighted fey, swallows one whole, or otherwise ingests part of one must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1 point of Strength damage and 1 point of Dexterity damage. One minute later, the creature must succeed at a second save at the same DC or be nauseated for 1 minute and take 1d6 points of Strength damage and 1d6 points of Dexterity damage. Ability Scores: Str +4, Con +4, +2 Cha. Feats: Blighted fey gain Toughness as a bonus feat. Skills: A blighted fey gains a +2 racial bonus on Knowledge (nature), Perception, and Stealth checks.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Righteous Bite (Su) A cayhound's bite is treated as magical for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Thunderous Bark (Su) Once every 1d6 rounds, a cayhound can bark with the concussive force of a thunderbolt. Every creature within a 15-foot cone-shaped burst must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude saving throw or take 3d8 points of sonic damage and be knocked prone. A successful saving throw reduces this damage by half and negates being knocked prone. The save DC is Charisma-based. Unbound (Su) Cayhounds move as if under a continuous freedom of movement spell.

    <Description>Cayhounds, also called leap dogs, are good-aligned outsiders who exemplify strength and freedom. They are descendants of Thunder, the pet mastiff of the Accidental God, Cayden Cailean, who uplifted his faithful companion upon achieving his own apotheosis. Thunder sired the entire cayhound race (including his famous son, Little Thunder) on the golden fields of Elysium. Cayhounds are filled with wild and turbulent forces barely contained within their canine shapes. They are intelligent and feel true lust for and joy in life, including righteous battle, good food, and strong drink. These fiery red hounds stand head to chest with most humans and weigh approximately 250 pounds. Wild as they are, the cayhounds are still more good-aligned than they are chaotic. Like their true master, they are great champions of freedom, and they channel his strength and courage (and a bit of luck) in opposing nefarious schemes wherever they find them. Some ally themselves with azatas, supporting good crusades against the Outer Planes. A pack of cayhounds might seek to disrupt a night hag and her steed's theft of good souls traveling to their intended destinations in the Great Beyond. Single cayhounds may be summoned via lesser planar ally by priests of Cayden Cailean to come to the aid of the faithful.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Luckbringer (Su) As a standard action, a ceru can bring luck or misfortune upon any creature it can see within 30 feet. This effect lasts for 1 round, and the ceru decides in advance whether the modified luck is good or bad. If the ceru grants bad luck, anytime the target makes an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check, it must roll twice and take the worse result. A successful DC 13 Will save negates this effect. If the ceru grants good luck, the target must choose a single roll (as above) prior to rolling, and may roll the chosen roll twice and take the higher result. A creature can only be affected by this ability once per 24 hours, and the ceru may use the ability once per day for every 4 HD it has (minimum once per day). The save DC is Charisma-based. If the ceru is a familiar, it may use its master's character level, if higher, in place of its racial Hit Dice for determining the number of uses of this ability, and for calculating the save DC (DC = 10 + 1/2 or the master's character level + the master's Cha modifier). Poison (Ex) Gore-injury; save Fort DC 13; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Con; cure 2 consecutive saves.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Cerus are artificial creatures created through the fusion of alchemy and magic in the Impossible Kingdoms of Vudra, where they are regarded as amazing pets for the rich and powerful. A single ceru fetches at least 300 gp from Vudrani specialty merchants. Most cerus are sterile, and so the rare breeding pair commands an additional +1,000 gp beyond the cost of two non-breeding cerus. Many breeders would rather kill their breeding stock (or murder would-be thieves) than lose control of their exclusivity. Cerus do not yet exist outside of exotic merchant stalls and strange arcane laboratories. Rumors persist of an alchemical formula allowing the creation of a first-generation ceru that is reliably fertile. This revelation is bound to spur a race among arcanists to find the formula and introduce these creatures to the Inner Sea region in much greater numbers. A spellcaster of 7th level or higher can bond with a ceru via the Improved Familiar feat. Upon reaching maturity, a ceru's body is 1 foot long and weighs 12 pounds. The rare fertile female ceru bears only one litter per year, no matter how frequently bred, with typically no more than one to three offspring.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Corporate Will (Su) A charnel colossus is composed of the sentience of scores of creatures. Though they are able to work in concert as a cohesive whole, they are also able to separate their actions at will so as to not be impeded by the limitations of a single consciousness, effectively allowing them to focus on two things at once. As a result, the charnel colossus can use up to two spell-like abilities in the same round that it makes physical attacks or other full-found actions. It also gains an additional spell attack per round. In addition, a charnel colossus is immune to being turned (though it can still take damage from channeled positive energy). While part of the creature's sentience may be affected by a turn attempt, there are enough unaffected intellects within to override the effect. Mind Feed (Su) When a charnel colossus succeeds at a grapple check with a slam attack, it can use its mind feed ability as a free action during each round in which the grapple is maintained. A victim of a mind feed attempt must succeed at a DC 38 Will save each round that the ability is used. On a failed save, the cadavers that make up the charnel colossus lock their mouths against the victim and begin to draw forth a part of her sentience to add to the collective. This action deals 1d6 points of Wisdom damage per round. If the victim's Wisdom score is reduced to 0, her soul and persona are wholly subsumed by the charnel colossus, and her body becomes bleached white and brittle and is incorporated into the creature's mass. The charnel colossus then has full access to all of the victim's memories (though not any special powers), and the victim can only be recovered and returned to life with a wish or miracle. If the charnel colossus has grappled multiple victims, it can attempt multiple mind feeds in a single round. The save DC is Wisdom-based. Voice of the Ancients (Su) A charnel colossus can, as a full-round action, cause its collective knowledge to be whispered into the minds of any sentient creature within 100 feet. These whispers riffle through the brain of any such creatures within range in a maddening susurrus. These individuals must succeed at a DC 34 Will save or be paralyzed and frozen in place as if by the hold monster spell. The victim may attempt a new save each round to try and break the effect. Regardless of whether or not the save is successful, the effect leaves an insidious seed implanted in the victim's mind. The day after the save is made, the victim must succeed at a new save or the seed takes root and creates the subconscious compulsion for the victim to return to the charnel colossus at some point in the future. When and how this occurs is up the GM. This compulsion can be removed with a remove curse spell or by destroying the charnel colossus that implanted the compulsion. This is a mind-affecting compulsion and cannot be negated by a silence spell because it is heard directly in the mind of the victim. Each time a creature is subjected to this attack, there is a 1% chance that some of the lost lore transmitted into her mind causes her to gain a permanent +2 bonus to Intelligence. This beneficial side effect can only occur to a creature once. When a charnel colossus uses this ability, it cannot use its spell-like abilities or take other actions in that round. The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Some dead don't rest easy because of the circumstances of their death or the horrific experiences they underwent in life. Their souls return to the world of the living demanding justice, revenge, or just wanton destruction. Some dead, however, never intended for their souls to leave. Instead they wished to preserve their knowledge, their culture, or some other aspect of their life in an undying form that could forever accumulate more of the same. In these instances, where lichdom is not sought as a viable option, and a multitude of individuals wish to take part, the result can be a charnel colossus. A charnel colossus is an amalgam of scores, even hundreds, of individuals who, upon death, chose to be interred under special ritual circumstances with others of like mind. This allowed them to feed their individual life experiences into an undying corporation of the collective whole. The resulting monstrosity would be like a living library-if it were living. The individual will of the deceased participants is subsumed in favor of a hive-like personality composed of all of the knowledge and experiences of the individual contributors. A few dominant or powerful members of this amalgam may give the resulting combined creature a general style of behavior, but no single constituent provides the creature with a true guiding force. Instead, the result is a pooling of the wisdom and experience of those who have been so interred-often over a period spanning hundreds of years-creating an abomination whose sole focus is the perpetuation of any such cultural traditions and the acquisition of more constituent parts to ever expand its breadth of experience. It is this guiding gluttony for further expansion of consciousness that ensures that even the most benign of traditions or experiential pools from which a charnel colossus is formed inevitably results in an all-consuming horror. The charnel colossus is a mass of the corpses that form its composition, often intermixed with earth, broken grave goods, and other burial materials if the decayed bodies alone are insufficient to fill out its massive size. This amorphous whole is collected within a membrane through which the individual corpses can still be seen and against which they often press as if seeking their freedom. But when a creature becomes trapped in the embrace of a colossus, the membrane proves to be permeable-the rotten, lipless mouths of those so interred are able to reach forth and feed upon the victim's own life experience. The colossus can also form two thin tendrils of this charnel stuff in order to lash out and draw prey into its embrace. As powerful, ever-hungering abominations, charnel colossi are thankfully few and far between. The only documented one currently known to exist is reported to be trapped beneath the ruins of Kalexcourt in northwestern Ustalav, in an ancient Kellid shamanistic burial site.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Compel Plants (Su) A fungus queen's mind-affecting powers and spell-like abilities (and spells, should the fungus queen gain the ability to cast them) affect plant creatures (but not mindless plant creatures) as if they weren't immune to mind-affecting effects. Create Spawn (Su) A creature that would normally be slain by a fungus queen's energy drain attack is not killed- instead, it immediately loses all negative levels imparted by the fungus queen and transforms into a fungus-infested minion of the queen. Such creatures gain the fungoid simple template. Fungoid creatures are under the control of the fungus creature that created them, and remain enslaved until their mistress is destroyed or until they are cured of the infestation (see the facing page). A fungus queen can communicate telepathically with her fungoid spawn at any range as long as they are on the same plane, and may have a number of Hit Dice worth of enslaved spawn totaling no more than twice her own Hit Dice; any spawn she creates that would exceed this limit become free-willed fungoid creatures. A fungus queen may free an enslaved spawn in order to enslave a new spawn, but once freed, a fungoid creature cannot be enslaved again (although it can still be influenced by the fungus queen's compel plants and plant empathy abilities). Energy Drain (Su) A fungus queen's energy drain functions identically to that of a succubus (Bestiary 68). Creatures killed by this attack do not die-they instead become infested with the fungus queen's spores (see Create Spawn). The save DC is Charisma-based. Plant Empathy (Ex) This ability functions as the druid's wild empathy, save that a fungus queen can use this ability only on plant creatures. A fungus queen gains a +4 racial bonus on this check. Mindless plant creatures are imparted a modicum of implanted intelligence when a fungus queen uses this ability, allowing her to train such creatures as guardians. Sporepod (Su) As a standard action, a fungus queen can cause a Medium pod of fungal material to burst out of the ground at any point within 60 feet of her current location. Once created, a sporepod cannot move. If the fungus queen travels more than 120 feet from a sporepod, it is destroyed. A fungus queen can maintain a number of sporepods equal to her Charisma modifier (7 for the typical fungus queen). As a move action, she can instantaneously travel to one of her sporepods as if using transport via plants. She can also choose to spread out her tentacle attacks among her sporepods, attacking a creature within 5 feet of any sporepod with a tentacle-she is still limited to making only four tentacle attacks as part of a full-attack action, or one as a standard action. A sporepod is an object that has an AC of 15 and 20 hit points; damage dealt to a sporepod does not harm the fungus queen.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Hundreds of years ago, a cabal of powerful succubus assassins in the service of Nocticula attempted to invade the Jeharlu, the Abyssal Realm of Cyth-V'sug, demon lord of disease and fungus. They sought to assassinate a powerful witch named Soris Delyn, who had befouled one of Nocticula's favorite mortal temples, hidden below the Chelish city of Vyre, before fleeing to her patron's side. The succubi failed at their mission, and from their corpses grew the first fungus queens. Pleased with the outcome, Soris returned to the Material Plane with the fungus queens seeded them throughout the Inner Sea region to aid in the spread of Cyth-V'sug's cult. The fungus queens have taken to the Material Plane like rot to a carcass, and today hundreds of the subversive creatures dwell in the foul reaches of the world. They are particularly fond of large cave systems in the reaches of Nar-Voth near the surface, and of the slums of ruined cities in the Worldwound. Styrian Kindler's Account of Ostog the Unslain tells of a particularly harrowing encounter with a fungus queen in the caverns below Devil's Platter east of Sandpoint, and of indications that this was but one of many such queens dwelling in the region. A particularly dangerous and powerful sect of advanced fungus queens dwells within swampy reaches of Tanglebriar, commanding groups of vegepygmies grown from the corpses of slain elves-these fungus queens have seceded from the rule of Cyth-V'sug and now serve his rebellious minion Treerazer in the crusade to corrupt and destroy Kyonin. An encounter with a normally nonintelligent plant monster acting in a sinister and organized way is sure evidence of the manipulation of a fungus queen, but these monsters are equally fond of commanding and keeping other creatures as pets and slaves as well, particularly attractive humanoids. Those charmed minions they especially favor are given the gift of the fungus queen's embrace, and are transformed into fungoid minions forever loyal to their pallid mistress. Fungus queens are violently jealous and possessive. Those who attempt to lure away their charmed and dominated pets or cure those they have infested gain their eternal ire, but it is by succubi that fungus queens are the most enraged. Whether it be a simple territorial conf lict or some deeper hatred born of their unique genesis, a fungus queen faced with someone whom she even suspects might be a succubus is a terror indeed, for in such battles the sensuous plants abandon their normally subtle approaches of mental control and trickery, and instead bring all of their power to bear in an attempt to rip the offending creature limb from limb. Fungus queens take great delight in transforming succubi into fungoid creatures under their control. While their jealousy doesn't compel them to do battle with other fungus queens, they are always careful to maintain their own territorial boundaries apart from any nearby queens, and they take great pains not to "poach" from their sisters' harems of charmed and infested pets. Many fungus queens grow quite powerful over time, typically gaining class levels in ranger, bard, or sorcerer- they generally do not become more powerful by merely gaining racial Hit Dice or increasing in size. A typical fungus queen is 6 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds. FUNGOID SIMPLE TEMPLATE (CR +1) Creatures with the fungoid template appear as they did in life, save that their flesh is pallid and moist, and mushrooms and mold cake their bodies. This template can be applied to any living, non-plant creature. A fungoid creature's quick and rebuild rules are the same. Rebuild Rules: The creature's type changes to plant, and it gains all of the traits of the plant type. The creature gains telepathy 100 ft. with other fungoid creatures. Its alignment changes to chaotic evil.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Delicious (Ex) Ghorans take a -2 penalty on Escape Artist and combat maneuver checks made to escape a grapple against any creature that has a bite attack with the grab ability. Ghorus Seed (Ex) As a full-round action, a ghoran can expel its ghorus seed from an orifice in its abdomen. If planted in fertile ground and left undisturbed for 2d6 days, the seed grows into a healthy duplicate of the original ghoran, save that the duplicate may reallocate all of its skill ranks upon sprouting. Once a ghoran expels its seed, it gains 1 negative level, and it dies as soon as its duplicate sprouts. This duplicate replaces the previous ghoran character. Light Dependent (Ex) Ghorans take 1d4 points of Constitution damage each day they go without exposure to sunlight. Past-Life Knowledge (Ex) Ghorans remember memories encoded in their ghorus seed. They treat all Knowledge skills as class skills.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>When Geb's magic despoiled his kingdom, the archmage Nex enlisted the renegade druid Ghorus to create a form of plant life that could survive in the blighted wasteland and sustain his starving people. Eventually, the plants evolved sentience and ambulatory bodies mimicking the appearance of their human farmers and consumers. GHORAN CHARACTERS (19 RP) Ghorans are defined by their class levels-they do not possess racial Hit Dice. They have the following racial traits. +2 Con, +2 Cha, -2 Int: Ghorans are hardy and guileful, but process thoughts slowly. +2 Natural Armor: Ghorans have tough, rugged skin. Plant: Ghorans have the plant type. Natural Magic (2 RP): Ghorans with a Charisma score of 11 or higher gain the following spell-like abilities: 1/day-detect poison, goodberry (created berries bud from the ghoran's body), and purify food and drink. The caster level is equal to the ghoran's level. The DC for these spells is equal to 10 + the spell's level + the ghoran's Charisma bonus. Delicious (-1 RP), Ghorus Seed (6 RP), Light Dependent (-2 RP), Past-Life Knowledge (2 RP): See above. Languages: Ghorans begin play speaking Sylvan and Common. Ghorans with high Intelligence scores can choose any languages they want (except secret languages, such as Druidic).</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Militant (Ex) A shadow giant is proficient in all simple weapons, all martial weapons, and one exotic weapon of its choice. Shadow Cloak (Ex) Because of the shadow giant's connection with the Plane of Shadow, as a move action in any illumination other than direct sunlight, a shadow giant can cloak itself in moving shadows that act as the spell blur for 1d6+6 rounds. It can use this ability three times per day.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Though their kind originated on the Plane of Shadow, several families of shadow giants have relocated to the wilder regions of Nidal at the invitation of the Umbral Court. They serve as a company of elite shock troops, kept a close secret and only used in operations where they are not expected to leave any survivors to tell the tale. Most shadow giants are especially taciturn and keep to themselves when not called to duty by the Umbral Court. They keep their own counsel and practice their own mysterious religion, whose bloody rituals of autosacrifice and cannibalism are presided over by their bone-and-feather-adorned shamans atop short-stepped pyramids constructed of dark basalt blocks. On the Shadow Plane, families of shadow giants have been known to combine together to form greater tribes when times of war are at hand. Such an army arrayed upon the field of battle is often enough to make enemies sue for peace with offers of gold and prisoners for sacrifice.</Description>

    <Description>Monkey goblins are an offshoot of the goblin race adapted for life in the high leafy canopies of Golarion's tropical forests. Equipped with ratlike prehensile tails, monkey goblins are as at home in the trees as they are on the ground. Monkey goblins lead a savage lifestyle, and many take levels in the barbarian class, though warriors and fighters are also common among the race. While spellcasting classes are almost unheard of among them, monkey goblin shamans in the service of demon lords or other dark gods are given a respect by other monkey goblins that borders on fear. MONKEY GOBLIN CHARACTERS (10 RP) Monkey goblins are defined by their class levels-they do not have racial Hit Dice. All monkey goblins have the following racial traits. +4 Dexterity, -2 Wisdom, -2 Charisma: Monkey goblins are fast, but foolishly impulsive and disagreeable. Small: Monkey goblins are Small creatures and gain a +1 size bonus to their AC, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, a -1 penalty to their CMD and on combat maneuver checks, and a +4 size bonus on Stealth checks. Slow Speed: Monkey goblins have a base speed of 20 feet. Low-Light Vision: Monkey goblins can see twice as far as humans in conditions of dim light. Acrobatic: Monkey goblins gain a +2 racial bonus on Acrobatics and Stealth checks. Fearless: Monkey goblins gain a +2 racial bonus on all saving throws against fear. Natural Climber: Monkey goblins have a climb speed of 30 feet. Prehensile Tail: See above. Languages: Monkey goblins begin play speaking Goblin. Monkey goblins with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following: Common, Draconic, Dwarven, Gnoll, Gnome, Half ling, Orc.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Create Spawn (Su) Any humanoid creature that is slain by a marrowstone golem rises from death as a free-willed ghoul in 24 hours. A creature with four or more class levels rises as a ghast instead. In either case, the ghoul or ghast has a 25% chance of retaining whatever class levels it had in life. Immunity to Magic (Su) A marrowstone golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the golem, as noted below. • A transmute rock to mud spell slows a marrowstone golem (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw. • Effects that heal undead heal half that amount of damage to a marrowstone golem, to a limit of its full normal hit points. • A marrowstone golem that fails its save against a magical attack that deals positive energy damage (including the channel energy ability when used to harm undead, but not when used to heal living creatures) does not take any damage from the attack, but it loses its create spawn ability, its necrotic field aura, and the negative energy damage from its slam attack for 1d4 rounds. Necrotic Field (Su) Undead within 30 feet of a marrowstone golem gain a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws, increase the save DCs of their extraordinary and supernatural abilities by 2, and gain a +4 bonus to channel resistance. Positive energy effects cause only half damage to a creature within the marrowstone golem's aura. Their aura particularly strengthens ghouls and ghasts, giving them a +2 bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Carved from rock hewn from the marrowstone mines of Sekamina, these golems amplify the magical radiation emitted by veins of lazurite. They can only be crafted within the necropolis of Nemret Noktoria, land of ghouls, for lazurite brought beyond its boundaries loses its potency. Binding the lazurite into the body of the golem stabilizes it and lets the construct leave the boundaries of the ghoulish city with its fell powers intact. Though the ghouls guard the secrets of making a marrowstone golem, they are sometimes known to trade their handiwork with outsiders. CONSTRUCTION A marrowstone golem's body is chiseled from a single block of marrowstone weighing at least 2,500 pounds. Marrowstone can only be found in the necropolis of Nemret Noktoria in the Darklands realm of Sekamina. Preparing the stone requires the use of exotic unguents that cost 2,500 gp. Marrowstone Golem CL 11th; Price 42,500 gp CONSTRUCTION Requirements Craft Construct, animate object, antilife shell, create undead, creator must be caster level 11th; Skill Craft (sculpture) or Craft (stonemasonry) DC 21; Cost 22,500 gp</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Construct Bane (Ex) A noqual golem deals an additional 2d6 points of damage against constructs (except other noqual golems) and undead created by feats or spells. Immunity to Magic (Su) A noqual golem is immune to and absorbs any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. • A magical attack that deals electricity damage slows a noqual golem (as the slow spell) for 3 rounds, with no saving throw. If the golem is under a haste effect, the attack breaks the haste effect instead. • A mage's disjunction spell staggers a noqual golem and negates its impeded magic ability for 1d4 rounds. Impeded Magic (Su) To successfully cast a spell within 60 feet of a noqual golem, a caster must make a concentration check (DC 25 + the level of the spell being cast). If the check fails, the noqual golem absorbs the spell. Powerful Blows (Ex) A noqual golem inflicts 1-1/2 times its Strength bonus and threatens a critical hit on a 19-20 with its slam attacks. Spell Absorption (Su) A noqual golem absorbs any spells blocked or dispelled by its impeded magic, immunity to magic, and spell sunder abilities. It heals 5 points of damage for every spell level absorbed. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. Absorbing a spell gives the golem the benefits of haste (as the spell) for 1 round per spell level. Spell Sunder (Su) A creature struck by a noqual golem's slam attack is targeted by dispel magic (CL 18th). It absorbs any spells so dispelled.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The construction of a noqual golem requires both a considerable supply of the skymetal noqual and the skill to overcome noqual's antipathy to dweomers. The resulting golem resembles an iron golem, but is larger and more nimble. Noqual golems impede magic by their mere presence, and their touch disrupts spells and magical constructs. Nearly all noqual on Golarion lies under Numerian control. The artificers of Numeria prefer tinkering with technological constructs rather than magical ones, but nonetheless Furkas Xoud was believed to have created a noqual golem. Another is thought to serve the sorcerers of Starfall as a fail-safe should their technology prove inadequate. A cabal of cyphermages has taken advantage of the recent discovery of noqual near Riddleport to commence work on their own magic-stealing golem. CONSTRUCTION A noqual golem's body is sculpted from 30,000 pounds of iron alloyed with 1,000 pounds of noqual at the staggering cost of 53,000 gp. Noqual Golem CL 18th; Price 253,000 gp CONSTRUCTION Requirements Craft Construct, geas/quest, greater dispel magic, polymorph any object, wish, creator must be caster level 18th; Skill Craft (armor) or Craft (weapons) DC 26; Cost 153,000 gp</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Eldritch Surge (Su) A Quantium golem can hurl a lance of eldritch energy that deals 30d6 points of damage to all creatures in a 240-foot line (Reflex DC 25 for half). The crimson Quantium golem deals half electricity and half fire damage, and slows a creature (as the slow spell) that fails its save for 2d4 rounds. The green Quantium golem deals half acid and half fire damage, and nauseates any creature that fails its save for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. Immunity to Magic (Ex) A Quantium golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted. • A magical attack that deals cold damage against the crimson golem or electricity damage against the green golem slows it (as the slow spell) for 1 round, with no saving throw. • A Quantium golem and its equipment are immune to rust attacks. Link (Su) Each Quantium golem always knows the exact location of the other. Urban Defender (Su) A Quantium golem gains 150 bonus hit points as long as it's within 1 mile of the city. If it moves beyond this range, it loses these bonus hit points.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Around the perimeter of Quantium, two immense golems march a patrol uninterrupted since the days of the archmage Nex himself. They stand as mirror images of each other, one crimson in hue and bearing a sword in the right hand, the other green and with sword in the left. Legend holds that Nex crafted the golems to defend his capital during a time of desperate struggle in which he foresaw his own absence. The golems only pause in their unending patrol if attacked or obstructed, and then only until they eliminate or circumvent the obstacle, whichever is most direct. The golems always patrol at opposite ends of the city, marching counterclockwise and pausing if their partner is interrupted. They last broke from patrolling in 576 ar, when they fought the Gebbite horde in the very battle in which Nex vanished from Golarion. CONSTRUCTION The secret of the Quantium golems' construction vanished with their creator, the archmage Nex.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Consume Flesh (Su) Once per round, when a kakuen-taka kills or reduces a creature to negative hit points with its swarm attack, it automatically attempts to consume the target's flesh as a free action (Fortitude DC 24 negates). If the target fails its save, its body is destroyed and the kakuen-taka gains the benefits of a death knell spell. This is a death attack. Create Carrionstorm (Ex) As a full-round action at sunrise, a kakuen-taka (a bhoga swarm with a flesh mansion) can create 1d4 carrionstorms (see page 408 of the Rise of the Runelords Anniversary Edition). These carrionstorms have a blinding poison in addition to their swarm attack. The carrionstorms are not under the control of the kakuen-taka but instinctively follow it, attacking minor foes while the kakuen-taka destroys greater threats. If the flesh mansion is destroyed and the kakuen-taka does not create another one within 24 hours, the carrionstorms are destroyed. Any carrionstorms in excess of four wander away from the kakuen-taka and are automatically destroyed 24 hours later. Carrionstorm Poison (Ex) Swarm-injury; save Fort DC 12, frequency 1/round for 6 rounds, effect permanent blindness, cure 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based (using the carrionstorm's Constitution). Dimensional Snare (Su) Any creature affected by the kakuen-taka's swarm attack must succeed at a DC 21 Will save or be affected by dimensional anchor for 1 round. This save is Charisma-based. Flesh Mansion (Ex) A kakuen-taka's bhoga swarm normally inhabits a hollowed-out reconfigured corpse called a flesh mansion, which it uses as a shelter, vehicle, and war machine. When the swarm wears a flesh mansion, it uses the above stat block (unlike a normal swarm, the flesh mansion's slam attacks have reach and threaten squares within its reach). As a standard action, the swarm can abandon its flesh mansion (which falls inert in its square), inhabit an empty flesh mansion, hide within its flesh mansion (gaining cover against all opponents but still being able to use its swarm attack), or stop hiding within the flesh mansion. If the flesh mansion is destroyed, the swarm can create another by performing a ritual that requires 1 hour and the corpse of a Huge creature. The flesh mansion is not a separate creature, nor is it undead; it is merely a corpse the swarm manipulates. Without a flesh mansion, the bhoga swarm's statistics are CE Diminutive outsider (chaotic, evil, extraplanar, swarm); AC 22, touch 21, flat-footed 15; Defensive Abilities swarm traits; Melee swarm (5d6 plus dimensional snare and distraction); Reach 0 ft.; Str 1; CMB -; CMD - (can't be tripped); Stealth +32. Fleshy Shield (Ex) A newly created flesh mansion has 150 hit points. The swarm takes only half damage from all attacks that deal hit point damage, with the remainder taken by the flesh mansion. Because a swarm of Diminutive creatures is immune to all weapon damage, apply half of all weapon damage to the fleshy shield and ignore the half that would be applied to the swarm. When the flesh mansion reaches 0 hit points, it is destroyed and the swarm functions like a normal swarm (see Flesh Mansion above). A kakuen-taka can repair a damaged flesh mansion by spending a full-round action grafting a corpse into it (restoring 5 hit points for a Small corpse, 10 for Medium, 20 for Large, 50 for Huge).</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>In the far northern lands bordering on the Worldwound, a strange and terrifying menace plagues the tundra and prairie-shambling fleshy abominations called kakuen-taka, the Hunger That Moves. They wander the desolate emptiness of the subpolar wilds, a living manifestation of the Worldwound's taint whose horrific onset is presaged by a sour-sweet wind and wheeling, screaming flocks of undead birds. The lucky victims of the birds' blinding poison are spared the sight of the rumbling juggernauts of putrefying meat driven like siege engines by a swarm of fiends called bhogas. Individually these fiends have little wit or skill, but together they have a malign intellect that allows them to construct mobile nests out of dead flesh like morbid termites building a mound. The bhogas find a giant, mammoth, or other creature of great size and devour its organs, usually while the creature is still alive and trying to resist. Once the creature is dying or dead, the fiends reconfigure the corpse's remaining flesh and bone into a hideous, multilegged pillar, which they then invade and inhabit like a hollow tree. Some of the bhogas use their collective strength to move the fleshy mansion's limbs while the rest clamber about its walls or skulk underneath it, searching for new prey to terrorize and consume. This monstrosity attracts birds the fiends animate as flesh-craving undead swarms. Together, the three components of this peculiar Ecology stalk the demon-tainted lands. If a healthy swarm discovers another suitable corpse, the fiends engage in a frenzy of mating, build a second flesh mansion, split into two swarms, then rapidly give birth to fill all the available space in their new home. When a flesh mansion becomes so rotted that it cannot maintain its structure or the swarm cannot easily move it, the bhogas abandon their creation and seek out another, leaving behind a monstrous, decaying shell, unrecognizable as the living creature it once was. Necromancers can use the husk for parts or animate the entire thing as a new abomination. Desperate ghouls, zombies, or animals might feed on it and become tainted by its latent Abyssal energies. As much a plague upon demons as upon the mortal races, kakuen-taka have no true allies. Perhaps this accounts for their constant wandering and their fondness for desolate and isolated locales, far from any that might interfere with their feasting. Rarely, a powerful demon might enslave one with magic and use the swarm's dimensional snare ability to capture and kill its rivals. Driven out of the central part of the Worldwound by more intelligent and organized demons, kakuen-taka have become a recurring plague in the southern fringes of the territory, below Storasta and abutting the borders with Numeria and Ustalav. In these lonely moors and hills, kakuen-taka regularly eradicate patrols and entire settlements. None of the adjacent countries values the empty lands highly enough to risk major resources to stamp them out. Kakuen-taka are indifferent to their own kind and attack each other only if one swarm has a flesh mansion and the other does not. Given adequate food, several kakuen-taka might travel together to tear apart larger prey, but over time they usually wander apart, following their separate carrionstorms, and have no sense of loyalty toward their former comrades.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Lost Time (Su) As a touch attack, a khaei can touch a creature and prematurely age it. The creature touched must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or take 1d4 points of Constitution damage and be permanently aged 1d10 years. This effect also deals 1d4 points of damage to the khaei. Effects from multiple khaei stack, though a single khaei can use this power on a given opponent only once.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The khaei are a mystery even to themselves. Their twisted limbs give them an awkward, shambling gait, and their personalities are dull and incurious, making them seem in many ways to be simply degenerate humans. At the same time, their bodies' tendency to trail off into mist and shadow, combined with their weird magical attack, suggests they could be much more. A typical khaei stands 4 feet tall and weighs 100 pounds. By far the most unusual aspect of the khaei is their ability to manipulate time. A khaei in fear for her life can grab an attacker and forcefully age him by several years, creating enormous strain on the foe's body. This exertion does damage to the khaei as well, and thus is rarely used, but a would-be tyrant who considers the khaei easy pickings may find himself surrounded by a weeping mob that quickly ages him into decrepitude-then forgives and cares for him. The few scholars who know of the khaei's existence speculate that the creatures may themselves be somehow unstuck in time, perhaps sent back or forward from another era in preparation for a great event. Khaei live in small, isolated communities underground, often inhabiting a single cavern and refusing to explore beyond it or otherwise improve their situation. The only known enclave of khaei in the Inner Sea region is in the Dark Forest, a cavern deep beneath the city of Kaer Maga, where they serve as both subjects and prey for the mysterious dullahan called the Dark Rider. One of the most cherished stories of these khaei concerns a time and place-somewhere in either the past or the future- when there were many more of them, their cavern-forests linked by magical standing stones.</Description>

    <Description>Korir-kokembe live in the deep, watery jungles of central Garund, plaguing the major rivers and lake systems. While young korir-kokembe may swim near populated waterways to claim their prey, their elder kin prefer more remote backwaters, sloughs, and heavily wooded swamps where they can hunt undisturbed. These degenerate dragons live in a violent symbiosis with the tiny vermin that infest the jungle, hosting colonies of such creatures within their own bodies. Such tiny vermin constantly swarm in and out of the korir-kokembe's gullet, bringing contagion to creatures bitten and allowing the wyrm to expel swarms of pests, or to summon yet more vermin to its aid. While korir-kokembe are capable of flight, they generally prefer to crawl or climb on their eight legs, hunching their bodies like inchworms or twining their coils around their prey while savaging creatures with a barrage of slashing claws.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Poison (Su) Anytime a creature is grappled by a termagant's tentacles or is affected by its rupture or shared rupture ability, it is exposed to the termagant's flux infusion. Flux infusion functions as a poison, but with unpredictable effects. Those who fail their saving throws take 1d4 points of ability drain. The ability score drained is randomly determined every time the flux infusion affects the creature (roll 1d6: 1-2 Constitution, 3-4 Dexterity, 5-6 Strength). The save DC is Constitution-based. Flux Infusion: Injury; save Fort DC 28; frequency 1/round for 10 rounds; effect 1d4 Con, Dex, or Str; cure 2 consecutive saves. Rupture (Su) When killed, a termagant explodes in a blast of its flux infusion poison. All living creatures within 15 feet must succeed at a DC 28 Fortitude saving throw or be poisoned. The save DC is Constitution-based. Shared Rupture (Su) Any creature killed while poisoned by a termagant explodes. All living creatures within 10 feet of the creature must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or be poisoned. The save DC is based on the termagant's Constitution with a -5 penalty. Unnerving Gaze (Su) A creature that succumbs to a termagant's unnerving gaze becomes nauseated for 1d4 rounds as its mind attempts to comprehend the horrors it has witnessed.</SpecialAbilities>

    <Description>The lashunta are the primary race of Castrovel, called "the Green Planet" for its steaming jungles. Though the women look like idealized elves or humans-save for the twitching antennae sprouting from their foreheads-their men are squat, hairy, and broad-shouldered, with a fierce and confrontational demeanor. Both genders excel at scholarship, and the race boasts a large number of telepaths and telekinetics, in addition to conventional magic-users. This ability to create mental or empathic bonds is particularly prevalent among female warriors, who form close connections with their saurian mounts. Female lashunta are typically 6 feet tall and weigh 140 pounds. The males of the race are usually 5 feet tall and weigh 200 pounds. LASHUNTA CHARACTERS (11 RP) Lashunta are defined by their class levels-they do not have racial Hit Dice. They have the following racial traits. +2 Intelligence: Lashunta are almost universally intelligent and eager to learn. Sexual Dimorphism: Male and female lashunta have very different body and personality types, more so than most humanoid species. Male lashunta are muscular (+2 Strength) and often brash and unobservant (-2 Wisdom). Female lashunta, though beautiful and commanding (+2 Charisma), lack the males' rugged builds (-2 Constitution). Lashunta Magic (5 RP): A lashunta possessing an Intelligence score of 11 or higher gains the following spell-like abilities: At will- daze, mage hand; 1/day-detect thoughts. The caster level for these effects is equal to the lashunta's class levels. Knowledgeable: A lashunta gains a +2 racial bonus to any one Knowledge skill. Limited Telepathy (3 RP): A lashunta is able to mentally communicate with any creature within 30 feet with whom she shares a language. Otherwise this ability is identical to the telepathy ability. Languages: Lashunta begin play speaking Lashunta and Elven. Lashunta with high Intelligence scores can choose any languages they want (except Druidic and other secret languages).</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Infernal Duke Traits An infernal duke is a powerful devil that has not yet made the full transition from unique devil to full archdevil. It possesses several traits, as summarized here. • Immunity to charm and compulsion effects, death effects, fire, and poison. • Resistance to acid 30 and cold 30. • Telepathy 300 feet. • Lorthact's natural weapons, as well as any weapon he wields, are treated as evil and lawful for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. • Lorthact can grant spells to his worshipers. Granting spells does not require any specific action on his behalf. Lorthact grants access to the domains of Evil, Law, Magic, and Trickery. His favored weapon is the quarterstaff. Intelligence Drain (Su) Lorthact drains 1 point of Intelligence each time he hits with a weapon or natural weapon (Will DC 39 negates). Alternatively, he can make a single melee touch attack per round, dealing no hit point damage but draining 2d4 points of Intelligence (Will DC 39 half). After draining Intelligence from a creature, Lorthact gains the benefit of foresight (as the spell) against that creature for 1 minute. Scholastic Masquerade (Su) When targeting a dominated wizard with his spell reservoir ability, Lorthact can also steal a school power from that wizard's chosen school. He can steal one of the wizard's 1st-level school powers by using three levels of his spell reservoir, both 1st-level school powers at a cost of six levels, and all school powers at a cost of nine levels. While Lorthact retains these powers, the target wizard cannot use them. The stolen powers function at the target wizard's level. Lorthact can steal school powers or a prepared spell from a dominated wizard, but not both. He may steal school powers from multiple schools if he has multiple wizards dominated. Spell Reservoir (Su) Lorthact can drain prepared arcane spells from the mind of a creature he has dominated and store them for later use, similarly to a ring of spell storing. Draining a spell requires 1 full-round action if he is able to touch the target, or 1 minute to perform through the mental link provided by the dominate effect; in either case, no saving throw is allowed. He can hold no more than one stolen spell from each dominated caster in his spell reservoir, and the total level of stolen spells cannot exceed 25. These stolen spells take effect at the original caster's level. Temporal Anomaly (Su) Lorthact exists slightly outside of the normal timestream. Spells that predict the future-such as augury, divination, foresight, and moment of prescience- cannot perceive him and provide no benefit against him or information about him. In addition, whenever a creature within 60 feet of him uses time stop, Lorthact can act normally within the duration of the time stop, as if he had cast it himself. As neither Lorthact nor the caster are frozen in time with respect to each other, each can target and affect the other with attacks, spells, or other effects they create, though they cannot affect other creatures within the duration of the time stop. This ability functions even if Lorthact is flat-footed or unaware of his opponent.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Lorthact the Unraveler, also named the Dwimmerlaik, the Ur-Magius, and the Diabolus Mystere, was once a high-ranking duke of Hell. Atypically, he was not solely bound to the service of a single archdevil, instead serving openly at various times as a mystical advisor and consultant on magical matters under both Geryon and Mephistopheles. Some believed him to be secretly a favorite of Asmodeus himself; this supposed favor provided some measure of protection from his jealous rivals. His last mistress in Hell was Eiseth, Whore-Queen of the erinyes, but when Eiseth uncovered a plot to reverse their positions-Lorthact arrogating himself to lordship and reducing her to mere consort-her wrath was enormous and eternal. Lorthact's allies deserted him lest they taste the fury of the erinyes. Lorthact proclaimed his innocence, but he saw condemnation awaiting and fled, racing across the planes with the whips of the erinyes at his heels. After several planar refuges proved no shelter from his relentless pursuers, Lorthact sought solace in the mortal realms. Laying several false leads, he then doubled back to the diabolists of Cheliax, the first place his pursuers looked for him on Golarion. But after they had moved on, he slipped back into places they thought already thoroughly scoured. Adopting a succession of guises, he kept his presence hidden for years, but he never felt truly comfortable under the gaze of so many potentially unfriendly eyes. Seeking a more remote locale, he traveled to the farthest reaches of Chelish sovereignty: the Varisian city-state of Korvosa. There he found the perfect patsy in the vain and corrupt Lord Volshyenek Ornelos. Rebuffed by House Thrune in his quest to restore his youth and vigor, Volshyenek was easy prey for Lorthact's inveigling. The devil bound him in a web of lies and stole not only his soul but also his life. Impersonating Lord Ornelos for over 200 years, he became a dominant figure in Korvosa, shadow-master of the Acadamae and sire of a great house. Meanwhile, he sought ways to rebuild his diabolic power and his store of souls so one day he might buy his way back to ducal favor in Hell. In the end, Eiseth's diabolic assassins found him at long last, and he was forced to fake his own death. Yet he still dominates Korvosa from the shadows, controlling the Acadamae through his descendant Toff Ornelos. Little happens in the city without his knowledge, and he plays the part of the mage through shadow-magic, illusions, limited wishes, and the stolen magic of others. However, casters who delve too deeply into his or Korvosa's secrets find themselves at odds with the deadly duke, his powers honed by centuries of exile to undermine and destroy mages who might uncover his identity or unravel his schemes.</Description>

    <Description>The magic-warping effects of the Mana Wastes often extend to the very life force of creatures who wander the trackless deserts. The dangerous radiations of magic gone afoul infuse the bodies and essences of these wanderers. Those who spend too much time in the Spellscar Desert or the wasteland's other treacherous environs occasionally fall prey to the deadly energies that persist in these regions, and their bodies gradually decay more and more until they are so far removed from their original forms that they can be described only as mutants. These twisted and degenerate creatures roam in packs throughout the Mana Wastes. Because those who succumb to the Mana Wastes' mutagenic effects often hail from the Grand Duchy of Alkenstar or one of its smaller holdings in the region, numerous humanoid mutants are proficient in the use of firearms, having learned to wield the weapons in place of the unpredictable forces of magic. Those who manage to actually secure a powerful weapon from one of the dwarven arms factories in the Wastes often garner the respect of other mutants. Such firearm wielders invariably rise to positions of power, becoming known as wasteland lords by their envious peers, who all squabble and fight for the same honor. Most Mana Wastes mutants collaborate in small tribal groups with other mutants, since those who wander the battered desert alone risk attack from the resident mutated vermin or violent bands of lawless gnolls, giants, or goblins. The civilized people of Alkenstar shun mutants for the most part, regarding transformed humans and other wanderers of the Mana Wastes as no better than monsters. The border guards of neighboring Nex keep a stringent lookout for such wasteland travelers and attack them on sight. The necromancers of Geb, however, see potential in the mutated peoples of the Spellscar Desert, and occasionally entreat them to leave their blasted home and relocate to the heart of Geb in Yled by promising a life of comfort and acceptance. In actuality, such mutants are taken to the infamous Mortuarium, where Geb's cruelest wizards perform unholy experiments on Alkenstar's deformed expatriates and turn them into undead abominations to serve in Geb's lurching army. CREATING A MANA WASTES MUTANT "Mana Wastes Mutant" is an acquired template that can be added to any living, corporeal creature. A Mana Wastes mutant retains the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here. CR: As base creature +1. Alignment: Any non-lawful. Type: The creature's type changes to aberration. Do not recalculate HD, BAB, or saves. Armor Class: A Mana Wastes mutant gains a +2 bonus to its natural armor over the base creature's natural armor bonus. Defensive Abilities: A Mana Wastes mutant gains a +4 bonus on saves against mind-affecting effects, DR 5/cold iron (or DR 10/cold iron if the base creature has 11 HD or more), and spell resistance equal to 11 + its adjusted CR. Mana Wastes mutants are immune to disease and poison. Speed: A winged Mana Wastes mutant's maneuverability drops to clumsy. If the base creature flew magically, it loses this ability. Melee: A Mana Wastes mutant retains all the natural weapons, manufactured weapon attacks, and weapon proficiencies of the base creature. It also gains a slam attack that deals damage based on the mutant's size. Spell-Like Abilities: A Mana Wastes mutant loses access to any spell-like abilities the base creature may have had. Any spellcasting abilities gained from class levels remain unchanged. Special Abilities: A Mana Wastes mutant retains any extraordinary and supernatural special qualities of the base creature. A Mana Wastes mutant gains one of the following abilities for every 4 HD or fraction thereof (minimum 1- the first ability chosen must always be disease). Acid Resistance (Su): A Mana Wastes mutant gains resistance to acid 10. This ability can be taken more than once. Each time it is taken, the Mana Wastes mutant increases its resistance to acid by an additional 10. A Mana Wastes mutant that gains acid resistance in excess of 30 becomes immune to acid instead. Acidic Pustules (Ex): Mana Wastes mutants are often covered in necrotic pustules that burst at the slightest touch. Whenever a creature deals piercing or slashing damage to a Mana Wastes mutant, all creatures adjacent to the Mana Wastes mutant must succeed at a Ref lex save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the Mana Wastes mutant's Hit Dice + the Mana Wastes mutant's Constitution modifier) or take acid damage as its boils and blisters pop and spray about. A Mana Wastes mutant deals an amount of acid damage in this way based on its size (1d4 points of acid damage for a Medium Mana Wastes mutant, 1d6 for a Large mutant, and so on). Breath Weapon (Ex): A Mana Wastes mutant can spray a 30-foot cone of acidic bile from its mouth as a standard action once every 1d4 rounds. The acid damage caused by this attack is equal to 1d6 per two Hit Dice the mutant possesses. A successful Ref lex save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the Mana Waste mutant's Hit Dice + the Mana Waste mutant's Constitution modifier) halves any damage taken from this attack. Disease (Su): Even though Mana Wastes mutants are immune to disease, they carry a deadly magical contagion that they spread with their slam attacks. Mana fever: injury; save Fort DC = 10 + 1/2 the Mana Wastes mutant's Hit Dice + the Mana Wastes mutant's Constitution modifier; onset 1d4 minutes; frequency 1/day; effect 1d2 Con damage, 1d2 Cha drain (or 1d3 Con damage, 1d3 Cha drain if the base creature has 8 HD or more); cure 2 consecutive saves. Anyone who lives with mana fever for a week straight without dying becomes immune to the disease, but also becomes a Mana Wastes mutant. Increased Speed (Ex): Some Mana Wastes mutants are transformed in such a way that their base speed increases by 10 feet. Deformities: In addition to its special abilities listed above, a Mana Wastes mutant gains one of the following deformities from its transformation (roll a 1d4 to randomly determine the deformity). d% Effect 1 Deformed Arm: One hand can't wield weapons, but the mutant's slam attack deals damage as if it were two size categories larger than its actual size. 2 Deformed Leg: The mutant's base speed is reduced by 10 feet (minimum base speed of 5 feet), but it gains a +4 racial bonus to its CMD. 3 Shattered Mind: The mutant takes a -2 penalty to Intelligence, but gains a +2 racial bonus on Will saves. 4 Warped Hide: The mutant loses its +2 racial bonus to Con, but gains an additional +2 bonus to its natural armor. Abilities: Increase from the base creature as follows: Str +2, Con +2, Cha -2. Skills: A Mana Wastes mutant gains Climb, Intimidate, Stealth, and Survival as class skills.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Fling (Ex) If a deadly mantis begins its turn with a Large or smaller creature grabbed in its claws, it can, as a standard action, fling that creature up to 30 feet away. Creatures thrown in this way take 3d6 points of damage as if they had fallen from the same distance. Rending Mandibles (Ex) If a deadly mantis hits with both claws and successfully grabs a foe, it can make an immediate bite attack against that foe as a secondary attack. This bite attack has a +12 attack bonus and deals 4d6+6 points of damage. In addition to dealing damage, the mantis can tear away the victim's armor as a free action by making a combat maneuver check. If the mantis is successful, the target's armor is ripped from its body. If the target fails a DC 31 Reflex save, the armor subjected to this attack loses half its hit points and gains the broken condition. The save DC is Strength-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The legendary deadly mantis stalks the deepest jungles of Mediogalti Island and the Mwangi Expanse. Tales about this lethal predator preying upon such mammoth creatures as drakes and giants frighten even the bravest hunters. Deadly mantises are sacred to the followers of Achaekek, the Mantis God, who keep the massive beasts well fed, and bring them sacrificial victims and livestock. Followers of Achaekek have also been known to serve as protectors of the dens of deadly mantises. Though creatures of this size and power obviously need no guardians, the devout followers guard their lairs and prevent adventurers from slaying the mighty insects. The typical deadly mantis stands 40 feet tall, 60 feet long, and weighs several tons.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Mock (Su) As a standard action, a mockingfey can magically take on the appearance of any creature it can see. This functions like disguise self, but with no restrictions on duration, creature type, or size. The mockingfey does not change size, and if the creature it's mimicking is larger than it, the mockingfey simply appears to be a miniature version. Anyone interacting with this effect can attempt a DC 12 Will save to see through the ruse. A mockingfey can maintain a given form indefinitely, but cannot change to any form other than its own without visual reference-once a given disguise has ended, the fey must see the subject again to resume that form. The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Mockingfey originally stem from the First World, where they're regarded as entertainment by locals and nuisances by visitors, who are the usual butt of the creatures' pranks. The pint-sized fey often congregate in large colonies called japes or mockingdells, inhabiting the trees near a commonly traversed path or meadow. When an intelligent creature enters the grove, one of the bird-sprites flies down to perch on the traveler's shoulder or some nearby vantage. It then promptly shifts shape to become a perfect, miniature doppelganger of the creature in question, proceeding to cavort and imitate the newcomer in a most convincing and unf lattering manner, mimicking the creature's tone but chattering only gibberish. This gibberish is not solely for comic effect, as while mockingfey are eager (if distractible) students in most matters, they refuse to use verbal language of any sort, believing that words unnecessarily constrain the things they describe. Instead, they communicate through gestures, pantomime, and elaborate dances. Those who think them mere beasts, however, are quickly set straight, as enemies of mockingfey are confronted with disorienting magic and the mockingfey's capricious allies from the First World. While many people find mockingfeys' antics irritating, the little creatures are surprisingly useful allies, with a loyal, friendly nature toward those who treat them well, and an insatiable curiosity that makes them surprisingly well informed about their surroundings. This same curiosity extends to things most folks would leave alone, such as the portal-like breach scars between the Material Plane and the First World. When such planar rifts occur, mockingfey are often some of the first creatures through, with colonies found in Kyonin, the River Kingdoms, and sylvan groves around the Inner Sea. Those illusionists and other spellcasters who seek such puckish familiars (and take the Improved Familiar feat) often find them worth the resulting hassle-if just barely. A typical mockingfey is 8 inches tall and weighs 2 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Breath Weapon (Su) Moxix can exhale a cone of acidic fog laced with a terrible disease. Any creature damaged by the acid of his breath weapon must succeed at a DC 28 Fortitude save or contract this disease. A humanoid afflicted with this disease must attempt a new Will save each day. If the humanoid fails, it attacks and attempts to eat the weakest humanoid nearby. If the save is successful, it resists this impulse. A humanoid who dies or is killed while afflicted rises as a ghast at the next midnight. The save DC is Charisma-based. Moxix's Delectation: Inhaled; save Fortitude DC 28; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Con and 1d4 Wis damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. Gush (Ex) Anytime Moxix takes more than 50 points of weapon damage in a round, blood and pus spews forth from the wound. The blood is extremely slippery and sprays out in a 20-foot radius, coating all creatures and surfaces in the area. Any creatures in the area must succeed at a DC 28 Reflex save or drop any items they are holding. A saving throw must be made each round that the creature attempts to use or pick up an item it previously dropped. In addition, the area coated in the gushing blood is difficult to move about in, and creatures moving through the area must succeed at a DC 15 Acrobatics check or fall prone. Hopedrinker (Su) Moxix emits an aura that drains hope from all within 60 feet. All morale bonuses are suppressed within this aura, regardless of their source. In addition, spells and spell-like abilities granting a morale bonus are affected as dispel magic used to counterspell (caster level 23rd) every round at the beginning of Moxix's turn. A successful dispel check negates the entire effect (not just the morale bonus) and grants Moxix temporary hit points equal to the spell's level (to a maximum of 100). These temporary hit points last 1 hour. Mindshatter (Su) If a creature fails its save against Moxix's eyebite spell-like ability, as a standard action before the end of his turn he may unravel the target's mind and spirit. This acts as greater dispel magic (caster level 23rd) against effects that protect against mind-affecting or necromantic effects and automatically affects the target as enervation and touch of idiocy (duration 24 hours).</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Moxix, the Drinker of Human Hopes, is a unique demon bound to the mysterious isle called Yoha's Graveyard in the Shackles. Appearing as an eldritch four-armed statue of weathered gray stone, Moxix has a single emerald eye centered in his horrible face. A nest of twisted horns rests atop his head, and his fang-f illed maw is perpetually stained with blood. Those courageous explorers traveling to his seemingly idyllic isle are driven mad by strange visions and dreams, or by inscrutable but disturbing carvings, idols, and glyphs that litter the island. Even if they withstand the island's maddening magic, adventurers in search of legendary lost riches may confront Moxix himself and be scourged of mind, body, and soul. Moxix's baleful presence and malevolent awareness leer from every crudely carved icon, relief, and idol bearing his likeness, bringing with them a tinge of insanity and a ravenous hunger for human flesh. Ghosts and pentagram-branded cannibals and lunatics are all that remain of ill-fated expeditions to Yoha's Graveyard. Moxix found his first worshipers among the terrible cyclopes of Ghol-Gan as their civilization fell into ruin. As the one-eyed giants slipped more and more into depravity and violence, they began worshiping foul, otherworldly creatures their brothers and sisters brought up from the vaults of the Darklands after their exposure to the serpentfolk's wicked ways. Among the dozens of fiendish icons was Moxix, who came into inf luence among the cyclopes as their practice of sacrifice and cannibalism increased. It was at this time Moxix became known as the Drinker of Human Hopes. The ancient Ghol-Gan cyclopes fed him hundreds of captured humans, most of whom were of Azlanti descent. In one instance early in his time among the Ghol-Gan cyclopes, Moxix's followers captured an entire Azlanti embassy and fed them to the strange demon one by one while their companions watched in horror. Some say the sacrifices' spirits still inhabit the region, their wailing cries drifting through the hills and jungles of the haunted island. As his reign of blood began to spread from its base in southern Ghol-Gan, a raging contingent of rival cyclopes from elsewhere in the failing empire raided the demon-worshiping clan dedicated to Moxix, bringing both brute strength and the magic of powerful shamans and oracles to bear against it. The battle raged for 2 days, and in the end an oracle sacrificed her life in a final ploy to destroy Moxix. However, the oracle only succeeded in binding him to the high mountain peak that would one day become the island known as Yoha's Graveyard. To this very day, Moxix remains trapped in his island domain, ever eager to draw creatures to the ziggurat he calls home. There he delights in turning people to cannibalism, destruction, and insanity. Obscuring and disease-laden mists swirl around the island, keeping its lands hidden and protected from trespassers. Once per year, however, on the first full moon after the rainy season, the mists part for a single night. Some explorers have mounted expeditions to Moxix's island during these events, but as of yet, no one has returned the same person she used to be; all bear the mark of insanity Moxix stamps on their being.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Curse of Living Death (Su) Once per round, as a free action as he kills a living creature, Nightripper can choose to afflict that target with the curse of living death. The target can resist this curse with a successful DC 30 Will save right before it dies, allowing the victim to die normally. If the victim fails its save, it enters a sort of half-living state; it becomes completely helpless, unable to take any actions whatsoever, but remains conscious and aware of the world, and of the pain in its body. It cannot be resurrected or otherwise restored to life until the curse is lifted. While the curse remains in effect, the victim takes 1d4 points of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma drain every day as any lingering shreds of sanity are blasted away. When each ability score is drained to zero, the DC of the curse increases by +4. A character suffering the curse of living death can remain in this state forever, but as long as any one of her mental ability scores is at zero, she is capable only of enduring pain and cannot observe the world around her. Even if the character's body is destroyed, the cursed victim's consciousness remains as a disembodied and invisible presence at the site of this destruction, and cannot be resurrected or released to the afterlife. The save DC is Charisma-based. Nascent Demon Lord Traits A nascent demon lord is a powerful demon that has not yet made the full transition from unique demon to full demon lord of an Abyssal realm. They have several traits, as summarized here. • Immunity to charm and compulsion effects, death effects, electricity, and poison. • Resistance to acid 30, cold 30, and fire 30. • Summon (Sp) Once per day, Nightripper can summon any demon or combination of demons whose total combined CR is 20 or lower. This ability always works, and is equivalent to a 9th-level spell. • Telepathy 300 feet. • Nightripper's natural weapons, as well as any weapon he wields, are treated as chaotic, epic, and evil for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. • Nightripper can grant spells to his worshipers. He grants access to the domains of Chaos, Darkness, Evil, and Strength. His favored weapon is the bastard sword. Slowing Gaze (Su) Slowed (as the slow spell) for 1 round, 30 feet, Will DC 30 negates. The save DC is Charisma-based. Swift Cuts (Ex) As long as he is attacking with a sword, Nightripper treats foes who are staggered, nauseated, or under the effects of a slow spell (or similar effects, such as his gaze) as if they were flat-footed. Sword Mastery (Ex) Nightripper possesses several sword-related bonus feats normally restricted to fighters.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Even today, centuries after his 13th and final execution, memories of Riktus Scroon continue to haunt the nightmares of those who live along the northern coastlines of the Inner Sea. During his reign of horror, the man who would come to be known as the Nightripper used his position in the now disbanded Graven Guard of Taldor to move along the shipping lanes with ease. His position among the mercenary company afforded him time in countless settlements from Golisfar to Corentyn, and in these unsuspecting towns he hunted. Scroon preferred young victims, that their vanishing would cause the most distress possible-his favorites were young adults freshly in love, although he seemed to have had no preference between man or woman. He abducted his victims with astonishing skill, tormenting them for hours with his blades before leaving them broken and bleeding to death at the bottom of a specially prepared pit far outside of town. The mass murderer was finally captured by Cesandra Dayne, an obsessed priest of Sarenrae who had lost her fiancee and her father to Scroon. Only by forsaking the teachings of her church was she able to trap the murderer in the slums of Almas, and although the resulting fight saw the death of a dozen innocent bystanders, in the end Cesandra had her man alive. After Scroon was turned over to the law in his hometown of Oppara, the authorities thought to prosecute him for the deaths of no fewer than 46 known victims. When Scroon gleefully bragged of having murdered nearly a thousand men, women, and children, the authorities were eager to write off his ravings, yet after Scroon provided exacting details to the sites of 953 victims, and one after the other his directions led to actual graves, the killer's sentencing was hastened-death by hanging. Yet Scroon survived. One after the other, attempts to execute the Nightripper failed-headsmen died of fright as they lifted the axe, guillotines malfunctioned, magic failed. Each botched execution left Scroon more disfigured, but his legend grew. The 13th and final execution put the man down once and for all-or so it was hoped. Scroon's soul went to the Boneyard, where something amazing happened-he passed through to the Abyss with his mind and memories intact. So remarkable was his retention of his identity that it drew the attention of Lamashtu herself, who pulled the killer's soul from the shuddersome bosom of the Abyss and made him her personal assassin, raising him from a broken shell of a soul to a nascent demon lord with greater power than he'd ever hoped for in life. His form had changed, transforming into a shape more befitting one of his horrific nature, yet his mind remained sharp and clear. Nightripper harbors a strong desire for revenge, but for now he serves dutifully as Lamashtu's favored torturer and assassin and as the lord of the dungeons below her palace in the Abyssal realm of Kurnugia. But it is said that someday, when he has repaid his debt to the Mother of Demons for his ascension and rescue from the dregs of the Abyss, the Nightripper will return to his old haunts. Only this time, it will not be individuals he breaks and bleeds and buries in his pits-it will be entire cities.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Frenzy (Ex) Once per day, an oronci that takes damage in combat can fly into a frenzy as a free action the following round. While in this state, an oronci cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skill checks, but functions as if under the effects of a haste spell. The oronci can continue to frenzy for up to 3 rounds, after which it is staggered for 1 round. Poison (Ex) Bite-injury; save Fort DC 17; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d3 Dex; cure 2 consecutive saves. Spit (Ex) An oronci can spit poison at a target within 30 feet as a standard action. This is a ranged touch attack, and can only be performed once every 1d6 rounds. If the attack is successful, the target is affected by the poison just as if it had been injured. The oronci can still poison a target with each successful bite attack. Undersized Weapons (Ex) Although an oronci is Large, its upper torso is the same size as that of a Medium humanoid. As a result, oronci wield weapons as if they were one size category smaller than their actual size (Medium for most oronci).</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>When drow fleshwarping alchemy is turned and focused upon an orc, the obscene result is called an oronci. Upon submersion in a fleshwarper's alchemical ichor, the unfortunate orc's legs merge, and its lower body turns black and elongates to a length of approximately 15 feet. This new body divides into segments, with each segment sprouting a pair of short, sturdy, thin legs. Finally, the horror's tusks connect to newly grown poison ducts that constantly drip poisonous spittle. The orc's head and upper body stay relatively intact as far as fleshwarping goes, though its eyes sometimes adopt a dark, vacant stare. With the exception of the driders, the oronci are among the most useful of the obscenities produced by fleshwarping. They embody all the savage brutality of an orc warrior, but mounted centaurlike upon an even larger, more powerful frame. Being less intelligent than drow, oronci make better shock troopers and advance soldiers for drow armies than the dark elves themselves. Oronci who have escaped the slavery of the dark elves have become favored champions for certain clever orc chieftains. Some oronci even overcome their sensitivity to daylight given time, which makes them better suited to terrorize the surface lands.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Curse of Stone (Su) Curse-touch; save Fort DC 17; onset 1 minute; frequency 1/day; effect 1d6 Dex. A creature afflicted by the curse of stone slowly turns to stone, its skin turning an ashen gray and hardening into a stony texture. For every 3 points of Dexterity damage taken, the victim gains a +1 natural armor bonus. The curse of stone can only be cured by removing the curse followed by a stone to flesh spell to undo the damage it has done. If the curse is not removed first, stone to flesh only restores 1d3 points of Dexterity, though these can be lost again as the curse continues to spread. The save DC is Charisma-based. Petrified Body (Ex) The stony flesh of a petrified maiden reacts to certain spells and effects as noted below. • A transmute rock to mud spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level to a petrified maiden, with no saving throw. • Transmute mud to rock immediately heals any and all damage taken by a petrified maiden. • A stone to flesh spell does not actually change the petrified maiden's structure, but negates its damage reduction and spell resistance for 1 round. Reconstitution (Su) As long as Geb's original curse that first afflicted the petrified maidens remains unbroken, any petrified maiden (animate or not) that is damaged or destroyed slowly returns to its undamaged form, even if parts of it were utterly destroyed or carried away. For a relatively undamaged petrified maiden, this slow process can be completed in a week or so. For a petrified maiden reduced to rubble, it might take years. If a petrified maiden is destroyed while under the effects of a stone to flesh spell, it cannot reconstitute and is permanently destroyed. Weapon Expertise (Ex) A petrified maiden is proficient with any one martial weapon. It gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with this weapon.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Petrified maidens are the remains of the army of warrior women led by the pirate queen Mastrien Slash in her failed invasion of southern Geb. The wizard king Geb himself cursed the warriors, turning them to stone and creating what is now known as the Field of Maidens. While a petrified maiden appears at first glance to be a construct, it has in fact been animated by the restless undead spirit of the warrior maiden it once was. The nature of Geb's curse remains mysterious even today-it is simply known that occasionally the spirits of the slain inhabit their stony corpses and lurch to vengeful unlife. When this occurs, the maiden's stone weapon changes to steel (though it remains fused within the maiden's grasp). The weapon can be recovered when the maiden is destroyed. Connected to one another by some unknown force-perhaps a side effect of Geb's curse-those petrified maidens whose remains have been removed from the Field of Maidens do everything in their power to rejoin their sisters.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Terminal Aura (Su) Every round, any creature within 50 feet of a memitim that has -1 or fewer hit points but is stable must succeed at a DC 23 Will saving throw or be affected by the spell bleed. Any dying creature within range of this aura does not receive a Constitution check to stabilize, but can still be healed as normal-though it may be affected by bleed in subsequent rounds if it is not restored to 0 or more hit points. Any creatures with fast healing or regeneration must also succeed at a DC 23 Will save every round or that ability does not function for 1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Soldiers know memitims as the angels of death, the black-winged specters whose own ominous hosts compose a third impartial legion fielded in the clouds above the bloodiest battlegrounds. As combatants shed their mortal forms in droves, memitims ready their weapons, prepared to drive back all manner of monstrous, soul-hungry scavengers that lurk just beyond the veil of death. While daemons, night hags, and undead number among their most persistent foes, memitims strike against any who would deny the dead passage into the River of Souls or who would cut a life short to harvest its essence. While most memitims impartially preside over bloodshed and massacres, their full wrath manifests against any who would cut numerous lives short in unnatural pursuit of their souls.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Soul Lock (Su) Once per day, a shoki can use its +2 cold iron quarterstaff to capture the soul of a creature at the threshold of death-any undead creature or being with 0 or fewer hit points. The target must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or be slain, its spirit locked within the shoki's staff. A corporeal undead transforms into a corpse if affected by this ability, while an incorporeal undead is trapped bodily within the staff (this ability cancels a ghost's ability to rejuvenate). A spirit trapped within a shoki's staff cannot be returned to life through any means short of true resurrection, miracle, or wish. A trapped soul can be freed if the shoki wills it, or by casting banishment, dismissal, or freedom upon the staff. A shoki's staff can only contain one soul at a time. The save DC is Wisdom-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Shokis are the collectors of lingering souls, tasked with compelling even the most deluded beings to take the first step into the River of Souls. Their tactics are varied, but most start by counseling the wayward dead using theosophical arguments and blunt warnings of the ravenous things that wait to feed upon lost spirits. Each shoki bears powerful tools to aid it in such pursuits-eclectic collections of holy symbols and withered staves of cold iron capable of imprisoning a single soul. Shokis only use their staves against the most stubborn or demented souls, whom they capture and personally escort to the Boneyard for judgment.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Censor (Su) A viduus that strikes a living creature with its quill can rewrite that creature's memories. The creature must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or have its memories affected in a manner similar to the spell modify memory. The viduus can rewrite 1 day's worth of the target's memories with a single strike. As a result, the creature is either stunned or confused for the next 1d4 rounds (50% chance of either). At the GM's discretion, this might have longer-term effects. A creature's memories can be restored by lesser restoration, modify memory, or similar spells. Memories lost in this manner are copied into one of the numerous tomes protected by the viduus. This is a mind-affecting effect. The DC is Charisma-based. Expurgate (Su) A viduus that strikes a dead creature-such as a soul, petitioner, or undead creature-with its quill can obliterate that creature's memories. The creature must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or have all of its memories erased. It retains language and basic knowledge, but no details as to the events of its life. This typically leaves the creature calm and indifferent to all beings around it. This memory loss is permanent, though the memories can be restored by lesser restoration, modify memory, or similar spells. Memories lost in this manner are copied into one of the numerous tomes protected by the viduus. This is a mind-affecting effect. The DC is Charisma-based. Transformation (Su) A viduus that is reduced to 0 hit points transforms. Its cocoon body bursts open, expelling a swarm of biting white-and-black centipedes (same statistics as a spider swarm) and a bank of mind fog centered on the viduus's square. A viduus can purposefully transform by spending three consecutive full-round actions, in which case it reforms somewhere in the Boneyard 1 month later.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Viduuses occupy the libraries and scriptoriums located atop Pharasma's spire. While lesser psychopomps record every soul's death and ultimate fate upon the planes, viduuses are interested in more extraordinary souls-their lives, deeds, deaths, and secrets. Existence holds many mysteries, and those mortals who had brushes with the extraordinary have their tales and confessions recorded by these semi-cocooned scholars and added to the volumes of the Boneyard's expansive library, known as the Catalogue of Last Days. Although pretentious in the extreme, viduuses prove quite knowledgeable about many historical and planar secrets, and what they don't know they generally have a decent idea of how to research, potentially summoning assistants from across the planes to aid them.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Hungry Gaze (Su) Chemnosit's gaze attack deals 3d6 points of nonlethal damage plus fatigue at a distance of 120 feet. A successful DC 30 Fortitude save negates the fatigue. Creatures already fatigued become exhausted; creatures already exhausted become staggered. A creature that fails its save must succeed at a DC 30 Will save or gain an overwhelming compulsion to eat flesh of creatures of its type, including its own if no other is available. The save DCs are Charisma-based. Spines (Ex) Creatures striking Chemnosit with natural weapons, unarmed strikes, melee weapons, or melee touch attacks take 2d6+12 points of damage.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The dread burrower Chemnosit is an engine of destruction, able to devour the stoutest construction and the mightiest of mortals with ease. His power lies in the profane glamour of his glowing eye, inspiring a gruesome urge to devour-a hunger for the flesh of one's own kind. For all his power, this is the true dread of the Monarch Worm. While he burrows constantly through the Darklands to the deepest Vaults of Orv, he sometimes rises to Golarion's surface bringing annihilation in his wake, as those corrupted by his awful eye wreak devastation upon themselves and their own people. Chemnosit drinks in the carnage like a feast before devouring any survivors.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Blood Rage (Ex) Any creature taking bleed damage from Volnagur's razor tongues takes a -4 penalty on Will saves and is affected as the murderous commandUM spell (Will DC 16 negates) each round that bleeding continues, ignoring allies that are also taking bleed damage from Volnagur. Eye Rays (Su) Volnagur fires eye rays at a range of up to 120 feet. Creatures struck by his eye rays are nauseated for 1 minute (Fortitude DC 29 negates). In addition, if the target fails a second Fortitude save against the same DC, it gains one of the following conditions, lasting as long as the nauseated condition, as its mind and body begin to unravel (roll 1d6): 1-confused, 2-fatigued (exhausted if already fatigued), 3-shaken (increase severity of fear effect if already present), 4-sickened, 5-staggered, 6-stunned. Reroll if an identical condition already exists. This is a sonic effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. Shatter Silence (Su) Volnagur's presence unravels magical silence effects or effects that provide energy resistance against sonic attacks. At the beginning of its turn, any such effect within 60 feet is targeted as dispel magic (caster level 25th).</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Volnagur, the End-Singer, is an alien thing whose very presence brings turbulence, disturbance, and cacophony wherever he soars. He flits with effortless grace upon a hideous assortment of mismatched wings that constantly molt and rot from within, the oldest wings falling off as new ones spring up and grow in their place. His skirling cry awakens madness and blood fury in those who listen, as does the touch of his impossibly long, jagged-razor tongues. Alien harmonics induced by his grotesque gaze cripple those upon whom he gazes.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Deadly Slam (Ex) A Spellscar fext threatens a critical hit with its slam attack on rolls of 18-20. Dispelling Critical (Su) Whenever a Spellscar fext successfully scores a critical hit with its slam attack, the creature struck must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or be affected as though by the targeted dispel version of a dispel magic spell (caster level 10th). The save DC is Charisma-based. Ravage Magic (Su) Any targeted spell or spell-like ability that fails to penetrate a Spellscar fext's spell resistance is absorbed by the fext and warped into a form of primal magic. A Spellscar fext can twist only a number of spell levels per round equal to its Charisma modifier (4 for most Spellscar fexts); any spells in excess of this limit automatically bypass a Spellscar fext's spell resistance and don't trigger this ability. Roll on the following table to determine the effect of a spell that has been affected by a Spellscar fext's ravage magic ability. Alternatively, a Spellscar mutant may use any of the sample primal magic events found effects with the CR of the Spellscar fext. d% Effect 01-40 The spell has no effect. 41-70 The Spellscar fext emits a burst of negative energy, dealing a number of points of negative energy damage equal to 1d6 x the spell level of the triggering spell to all creatures in a 30-foot-radius burst. 71-90 The Spellscar fext instantly switches places with the spellcaster that targeted the fext with the triggering spell as though by dimension door. 91-100 The spell is immediately turned back on its caster via spell turning. Vulnerable to Glass (Ex) A Spellscar fext's hide is particularly vulnerable to the penetrations of glass and glass-based weapons. Spellscar fexts take 150% as much damage as normal from glass-headed piercing or slashing weapons.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The abominable undead known as Spellscar fexts are formed by wayward spellcasters who perish in the sprawling badlands of the Mana Wastes, their bodies and souls perverted by the unpredictable primal energies that surge throughout the Spellscar Desert. The average Spellscar fext stands about 6 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds. The unnatural and corruptive transformations a fallen victim undergoes as it turns into a Spellscar fext render its body hard and especially resilient to the magical energies of most spellcasters. In a peculiar twist, the same corruptive energy that causes spells to bounce off of Spellscar fexts' hides also strangely renders them susceptible to glass and glass-based weapons. Talented gunsmiths from Alkenstar have managed to craft glass bullets for rif le-wielding adventurers and monster hunters for the purpose of eradicating Spellscar fexts.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Dreamwarden (Su) Any sleeping creature within 30 feet of a star monarch is protected by protection from evil and sanctuary (Will DC 15 negates). The save DC is Constitution-based. Glowsap (Ex) As a standard action, a star monarch can spray a target within 30 feet with an adhesive spittle as a ranged touch attack. A creature struck is affected as a tanglefoot bag (Reflex DC 20 partial; see Core Rulebook 160). In addition, this adhesive glows under starlight or moonlight, limning the target as faerie fire if used outdoors at night. The save DC is Constitution-based. Navigational Awareness (Ex) Star monarchs never become lost and are immune to maze spells or any effect that would cause them to lose their sense of direction. Starflight (Su) A star monarch can survive in the void of outer space. It flies through space at an incredible speed. Although exact travel times vary, a trip within a single solar system should take 3d20 hours, while a trip beyond should take 3d20 days (or more, at the GM's discretion). Toxic Flesh (Ex) A star monarch's flesh is poisonous. A creature biting it or ingesting any part of its body becomes sickened for 1d4 rounds (Fortitude DC 20 negates) and is affected as if it had consumed a dose of arsenic (Core Rulebook 558).</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Star monarchs are magical emissaries of Desna, the guide and protector of those who wander and guardian of dreams. They fly in glowing clouds through the void of space, visiting Golarion to watch over the faithful of Desna. Star monarchs spin streamers of sticky silver, weaving evanescent gossamer cocoons to enrobe those who slumber under their protection. These cocoons sublimate into wisps of half-remembered dreams with the coming of dawn. Star monarchs rarely intervene directly in combat, more often helping good creatures by aiding them from the shadows, guiding their paths, or guarding them while they sleep. Star monarchs can be found across Golarion in a variety of iridescent hues, and all are sacred to followers of the Song of the Spheres.</Description>

    <Description>From lofty monastery-cities entrenched in soaring cliff sides and high mountain valleys, the syrinx seek to bring peace to all lands that fall within sight of their marbled spires. Erudite and aloof, the owl-like scholars embrace art, philosophy, and nebulous faiths, seeking to distance themselves from a history of barbarism and ruin. To this end, they seek to enslave all lesser races, especially those without wings. Their elitist culture rests upon thousands of backs in an elaborate hierarchy of slaves. Directly below the syrinx are the strix, a race they magically modified in the distant past to serve as warriors and slave masters. SYRINX CHARACTERS (16 RP) Syrinx are defined by their class levels, and do not possess racial Hit Dice. Syrinx have the following racial traits. -2 Dex, +2 Wisdom: Syrinx are contemplative and patient, traits that make them somewhat slow to act. Normal Speed: Syrinx have a base speed of 30 feet. Flight: Syrinx have a fly speed of 60 feet with average maneuverability. Low-Light Vision: Syrinx can see twice as far as humans in conditions of dim light. Darkvision: Syrinx can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Nocturnal: Syrinx gain a +2 racial bonus on Perception and Stealth checks at night. Pride (2 RP): Syrinx receive a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects. Speak with Avians (0 RP): See above. Languages: Syrinx begin play speaking Syrinx. Syrinx with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following: Auran, Azlant, Celestial, Strix, or Infernal.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Vanish (Su) Once per day as a move action while benefiting from concealment, a thin man can simply vanish from sight. This gives it a +20 bonus on Stealth checks and the ability to hide in plain sight for 1 round per Hit Die even when there is no cover, concealment, or shadow nearby. If it makes an attack, the thin man is no longer in its vanished state. It usually uses this ability when attempting to elude pursuit.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The mysterious thin men of Nuat have long been a part of Rahadoumi legend. They inhabited their tiny island home long before human colonists first arrived, and the so-called thin men have lived on the periphery of Rahadoumi society or among the indigenous cane fields since times long forgotten. Their natural coloration and slender frames serve particularly well in concealing them from the prying eyes of suspicious humans. The thin men use their naturally hard and sharp claws to dig narrow burrows beneath the fields and copses of the island. Their bodies have few bones-instead, their skeletal frameworks are almost entirely cartilaginous in nature, which allows them to navigate their tiny burrows with relative ease and escape the notice of their human neighbors. Their close connection with the earth likewise gives them immunity to natural toxins. Though the thin men generally keep to themselves, only observing their human counterparts from the shadows, on occasion they tire of the meager fare of plant roots, grubs, and small vermin on which they normally subsist, and catch a local farmer alone in his fields or traveling at night. On these occasions, they murder the hapless victim and feast on his remains. Their uncanny ability to hide in the endless waving fields of cane lets them avoid the patrol of the Pure Legion or posse of vengeful farmers that comes around to search for the killer.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Planebound (Ex) An umbral shepherd is inherently tied to the Plane of Shadow, and can't survive for long on any other plane without a host body. Each round that an umbral shepherd is on another plane without a host body, it takes 1d6 points of damage. Possession (Su) An umbral shepherd can possess a host body as if using magic jar, save that if its host body is killed while possessed, the shepherd dies as well. An umbral shepherd can attempt a possession anytime it succeeds at a touch attack, even while already in a host body. If the touched creature fails a DC 15 Will save, it becomes possessed. Possession by an umbral shepherd takes a toll on its host body, which takes 1 point of Constitution drain every month it is so possessed. Abandoning a host body requires the umbral shepherd to either take a standard action (to appear in a square adjacent to the host) or make a successful possession attempt on a new host. The save DC is Charisma-based. Shadow Touch (Su) An umbral shepherd that succeeds at a touch attack can attempt to dissolve a portion of the victim's flesh into shadow, which then dissipates, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage. Victims that succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save take half damage. The umbral shepherd can use this ability even while possessing a host body. The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Umbral shepherds are parasitic entities eternally devoted to Zon-Kuthon. Brought forth onto Golarion primarily by the shadowcallers of Pangolais in Nidal, the evil creatures relish the chance to infest host bodies and use these vessels to further the work of their dark master. Those infested by such creatures are identifiable primarily by their pure-black eyes and fervor for the Midnight Lord, as well as the slow decay of their bodies. Umbral shepherds also serve as specialized torturers, with their ability to create bloodless cavities and tunnels through a prisoner's body with a touch of their horrible, burrowing tentacles. Whether Zon-Kuthon created the umbral shepherds or simply discovered and adopted them into his faith is unclear, but the shadowy parasites are irreversibly linked to both him and their home plane. Though they lust for the chance to spread their worship elsewhere, exposure to the light and energy of other planes is extremely harmful to them, thus necessitating the use of host bodies. Umbral shepherds value their hosts as vehicles but ultimately see them as disposable, knowing that without powerful magic their vessels will gradually sicken and die. An umbral shepherd that believes its vessel is close to death almost always abandons it rather than risking death itself, and usually transfers to a new host. In their natural state, umbral shepherds are shaped like limbless, demon-faced humans made of coherent shadow, and are capable of spawning any number of tentacles of varying sizes. Some religious scholars believe that the first Joyful Things may have been attempts by Kuthites to change themselves into something closer to the shepherds, yet this remains the unsubstantiated speculation of outsiders.</Description>

    <Source>Inner Sea Bestiary</Source>
    <IsTemplate>1</IsTemplate>
    <Description>While most of the Inner Sea's vampires lust for living blood, the mysterious vetalas hunger for a more intangible force: the energy that infuses mortal minds. Referred to as consciousness or psyche by some, the academics of Vudra- from where most vetalas hail-call this fundamental vital force prana. Regardless of their desire's name, vetalas prey upon those who show creative promise, possess potent force of will, or seem destined for greatness, draining the most brilliant sources of mortal light to fuel their own unnatural embers. Their dark mastery of life force allows vetalas to possess corpses or even overwhelm the minds of living creatures. With these stolen masks and the resources of abducted lives, they work their foul wills. Vetalas are said to be the spirits of children "born evil," who never received burial rites upon their deaths. Sometimes one of these evil spirits takes hold of a corpse- not necessarily its own-which becomes its anchor to the mortal world. Such young souls seek out experiences and life energy, becoming as wicked as any other vampire as they endlessly indulge their profane, deathless desires. CREATING A VETALA "Vetala" is an acquired template that can be added to any living creature with 5 or more Hit Dice (referred to hereafter as the base creature). Most vetalas were once humanoids, fey, or monstrous humanoids. A vetala uses the base creature's stats and abilities except as noted here. CR: Same as the base creature + 2. AL: Any evil. Type: The creature's type changes to undead (augmented). Do not recalculate class Hit Dice, BAB, or saves. Senses: A vetala gains darkvision 60 ft. Armor Class: Natural armor improves by +4. Hit Dice: Change all racial Hit Dice to d8s. Class Hit Dice are unaffected. As undead, vetalas use their Charisma modifiers to determine bonus hit points (instead of Constitution). Defensive Abilities: A vetala gains channel resistance +4, DR 10/magic and good, and resistance to fire 10 and electricity 10, in addition to all of the defensive abilities granted by the undead type. A vetala also gains fast healing 5. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, a vetala is helpless and its fast healing ceases to function for 1 hour. Additional damage dealt to the vetala has no effect. Its body might be subjected to any method of dismemberment or desecration, but after 1 hour-regardless of the state of its remains-it regains 1 hit point, is no longer helpless, and resumes healing at the rate of 5 hit points per round. Weaknesses: Vetalas cannot tolerate the sound of prayers or religious mantras recited by those truly faithful to a good deity. Any character with a good-aligned deity can force a vetala to recoil by dramatically praying as a standard action. Praying doesn't harm a vetala; it merely keeps the creature at bay. A recoiling vetala must stay at least 5 feet away from a praying character and cannot touch or make melee attacks against it. After 1 round, a vetala can fight past its revulsion and function normally each round it succeeds at a DC 25 Will save. The prayers of those who worship non-good deities or worship no deity have no effect on a vetala. Reducing a vetala's hit points to 0 or lower incapacitates it but doesn't always destroy it (see fast healing). However, consecrating the vetala's remains and burying the body destroys it forever. A vetala's body is considered consecrated if it is doused with a vial of holy water and buried, if it is buried in earth affected by the spell consecrate, or if bless, prayer, or a similar divine spell is cast upon it as it is being buried. Digging up a vetala's corpse or profaning the area where it's buried does not restore a buried vetala. Speed: Same as the base creature. A vetala also gains a climb speed equal to its base land speed. Melee: A vetala gains two claw attacks if the base creature didn't have them. A vetala's claw attacks do damage as a creature once size category larger (for example, a Medium vetala's claw attack deals 1d6 points of damage). A vetala's natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Special Attacks: A vetala gains several special attacks. Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 the vetala's Hit Dice + the vetala's Cha modifier unless otherwise noted. Drain Prana (Su): A vetala can drain the mental vitality of a grappled opponent. If the vetala establishes or maintains a pin, it drains this energy, dealing 1d4 points of Charisma damage. Additionally, the victim is affected by the spell modify memory, as if the vetala had spent 5 minutes concentrating. The vetala gains perfect knowledge of any memory it chooses to eliminate using this ability. Vetalas often use this ability to prevent victims from remembering they've been attacked. Malevolence (Su): As a full-round action, a vetala can attempt to take control of a helpless living creature's body, as the spell magic jar (caster level 10th or the vetala's Hit Dice, whichever is higher), except that it does not require a receptacle. The target can resist the attack with a successful Will save. A creature that successfully saves is immune to that same vetala's possession for 24 hours. If a creature fails its save, its consciousness and control of its body are subsumed as the vetala takes command of its body. The vetala can remain in control for a number of hours equal to its Charisma modifier or until it decides to end the possession. Whenever the possession ends or the host body is killed, the vetala's consciousness instantly returns to its body, regardless of distance, so long as it remains on the same plane. If the vetala's body has been destroyed or moved to another plane, the vetala's consciousness is destroyed when the possession ends. While possessing another creature, the vetala's body is empty and vulnerable, though it is instantly aware if its body is disturbed or takes damage. Paralysis (Ex): Any creature struck by a vetala's claws must make a successful Will save or be paralyzed for 1d4+1 rounds. Elves are immune to this effect. Possess Corpse (Su): As a full-round action, a vetala can possess a Large or smaller corpse just as it can a living body. The vetala's consciousness leaves its body and takes control of the corpse, animating it as either a skeleton or zombie (depending on its state of decay). The vetala can remain in control of a corpse indefinitely, and can communicate through the body, but cannot use any of its other special abilities. This ability otherwise functions just as malevolence. Ability Scores: Str +4, Dex +2, Int +4, Wis +2, Cha +6. As an undead creature, a vetala has no Constitution score. Feats: Vetalas gain Alertness, Blind-Fight, Deceitful, Improved Initiative, and Skill Focus (Disguise) as bonus feats. Skills: Vetalas gain a +8 racial bonus on Disguise, Perception, Sense Motive, and Stealth checks.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Consume Memory (Su) When a veiled master bites a creature, it consumes some of that creature's memories. The creature bitten must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude save or gain one negative level. A veiled master heals 5 points of damage each time it grants a negative level in this way, and also learns some of the target creature's memories (subject to the GM's discretion). This is a mind-affecting effect. A veiled master can suppress this ability as a free action. The save DC is Charisma-based. Delayed Suggestion (Sp) Whenever a veiled master successfully uses dominate person or dominate monster on a creature, it can also implant a delayed suggestion that triggers when dominate effect ends. Typically, this suggestion (which functions as a spell-like ability, CL 20th, Will DC 19 negates) is for the previously dominated creature to seek out the veiled master again and submit to a new domination attempt, but sometimes, a veiled master implants other suggestions (such as a suggestion to attack the first person it sees). Mucus Cloud (Ex) While underwater, a veiled master exudes a cloud of transparent slime in a 30-foot-radius spread. All creatures in this area must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude save each round or lose the ability to breathe air (but gain the ability to breathe water) for 24 hours. Renewed contact with this mucus cloud and failing another save extends the effect for another 24 hours. The save DC is Constitution-based. Runemastery (Ex) A veiled master is particularly skilled at casting spells that create magical writing, such as explosive runes, secret page, or any spell with the word "symbol" in its name. It never requires material components or focus components when casting such spells, and the save DC of any of these spells increases by 1. A veiled master's symbol spells are difficult to disarm-the Disable Device DC for these symbols increases by 2. Slime (Ex) A creature hit by any of a veiled master's bite or claw attacks must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude save or have its skin and flesh transform into a clear, slimy membrane over the course of 1d4 rounds. The creature's new "flesh" is soft and tender, reducing its Constitution score by 4 as long as the condition persists. If the creature's flesh isn't kept moist, it dries quickly and the victim takes 1d12 points of damage every 10 minutes. Remove disease and similar effects can restore an afflicted creature to normal, but immunity to disease offers no protection from this attack. The save DC is Constitution-based. Spells A veiled master can cast spells as a 12th-level sorcerer. Swift Transformation (Su) A veiled master can use its change shape ability as a swift action. Thoughtlance (Su) Four of a veiled master's tentacles end in glowing spheres of light. These spheres deal 2d6 points of electricity damage on a touch attack, and also blast a creature's mind with waves of mental energy-a creature touched by one of these tentacles (regardless of whether the touch deals electricity damage) must succeed at a DC 24 Will save or be staggered for 1 round. Additional touches increase the duration by 1 round. While a creature is staggered in this manner, it must make concentration checks to cast spells as if it were experiencing extremely violent motion while casting (DC = 20 + spell level). The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The aboleths are among the oldest of Golarion's denizens, creatures that can trace back their presence in the deepest reaches of the world's oceans to times far before humanity came to dwell upon the globe- or before even most deities themselves turned their attentions to this tiny sphere of water and stone. In those ancient times, elder forces and eldritch entities knew of the world. While they were not gods as are known today, even they were dismissed and ignored by the aboleth race, for the aboleths knew that what the gods could accomplish, so could they, given time. And the aboleths have always had time. During the era of ancient Azlant, when the aboleths manipulated humanity like puppets, some of their kind walked among their pets in disguise, veiling themselves with magic to appear as humanoids. These were the veiled masters, and if one were to make the foolish attempt at imposing human constructions on this alien race, the veiled masters would be considered the nobility among aboleth-kind. In truth, while the aboleths do treat the veiled masters with utmost respect and defer to their decisions, they are not regarded as the rulers of the race- even stranger and more dangerous entities rule over the veiled masters in the deepest trenches below the sea. Aboleths are without a doubt skilled at domination and illusion, but the veiled masters are the true experts of the arcane. It is they who engineered the deceptions and manipulations of ancient Azlant's culture. Their hidden gifts and subtle coaxings did much to encourage humanity's first rise to glory in that age, and many of Azlant's nations had veiled masters walking among them, whispering into their leaders' ears. The people knew the veiled masters as powerful wizards, and there were murmurs that the mysterious cabal was more than human, but few suspected the truth for very long. The veiled masters handled such suspicions by doing violence to the bodies and minds of those who proved too curious. It was the veiled masters who first learned of Azlant's growing hubris-of their beliefs that they were greater than their patrons. At first, their punishments were minor, yet to the veiled masters' surprise and frustration, these acts only strengthened humanity's resolve. In the end, Earthfall was the answer, and as Azlant sank below the waves, the veiled masters retreated to the depths as well, content for now that the devastation above would serve as a lesson that would never be forgotten. Today, the veiled masters live on. They walk among the humanoid races again, watching and waiting. The time to teach a new lesson draws ever closer.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Aura of Madness (Su) Any creature within a 60-foot radius of the vespergaunt must succeed at a DC 21 save or be confused for 1d4 rounds. Once a creature successfully saves, it cannot be affected by the same vespergaunt's aura again for 24 hours. As a free action, the vespergaunt can suppress its aura. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. Damage Reduction (Su) A vespergaunt's damage reduction is bypassed by any weapons that are chaos-, evil-, good-, or law-aligned. Siphon Spirit (Su) Any creature touched by a vespergaunt must succeed at a DC 21 Will save or gain 1 negative level as the vespergaunt rips away a portion of its soul. A divine spellcaster gains an additional negative level with each failed save. The victim must save anew each time it is touched, and a character killed by this attack disintegrates completely except for its eyes and strands of brain matter, which become part of the vespergaunt. Only powerful magic such as miracle or wish can resurrect a creature slain in this manner.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Often called "heresy oozes," vespergaunts are emissaries and tools of the horrible god-things of the Dark Tapestry. Found primarily on Aucturn, vespergaunts act as spiritual conduits for those attempting to contact the Great Old Ones, collecting and relaying those prayers deemed worthy while also preparing inhabited worlds for the coming of the Dominion of the Black. A typical vespergaunt is 8 feet tall and 6 feet wide, and weighs just 50 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Expressive Chameleon (Ex) Once per round as a free action, a water wraith can change its color to any of its own choosing. A water wraith using this ability to camouflage itself gains a +8 bonus on Stealth checks.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Water wraiths are eight-legged amphibious lizards indigenous to the Mwangi Expanse with the ability to change their color at will. This chameleon-like ability, combined with their superior intelligence, makes them coveted as exotic pets or guard animals. They are imported throughout Garund for those virtues. Patient and cunning hunters, water wraiths prefer to lie still in ponds and rivers until their prey comes within range. When an unfortunate creature does, these fearless hunters strike, their webbed claws propelling them quickly forward either on land or in water. Once their toothy, eel-like mouths attach to victims, water wraiths quickly begin to bleed them dry. Water wraiths depicted here represent the upper end of size limitations for captive specimens. In captivity, these creatures are deliberately kept underfed and rarely grow beyond 2 feet in length. Water wraiths encountered wild in the Mwangi wetlands, or kept on an unrestricted diet, grow to even more massive sizes. Strange superstitions are born out of water wraiths' color-changing powers. This changeability is not just an automatic defensive response, but can be a matter of self-expression, or even strategy and tactics on the part of the creature. Water wraiths often express likes and dislikes with an outward display of color: bright red is frequently associated with hunger, and dull green represents dislike or lack of interest. Some small communities in Katapesh and Osirion actually utilize water wraiths in a primitive system of jurisprudence. The authorities release the accused into a pen with the creatures, then interpret the reactions of the lizards as signs of guilt or innocence. All too frequently, the wraiths declare the accused innocent by virtue of being delicious. Water wraiths find full-blooded elves to be unpalatable, but show no aversion to their half-elven cousins. Water wraiths are not limited to changing color in response to base drives, however. Sneaky and cunning, they do not hesitate to blend into their surroundings despite their emotional state if it affords them an advantage in hunting.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Burrowing Bite (Ex) If a whirlmaw successful hits a Small or larger creature with its bite attack, it immediately attempts to start a grapple as a free action with a +4 bonus on the grapple check. If the grapple check is successful, the whirlmaw's spinning, sawlike mouth immediately begins to burrow into the flesh of the creature, dealing 4d6+12 points of damage per round until the grapple is broken. Dust Cloud (Ex) By rapidly beating the leathery flaps of skin attached along its body, a whirlmaw can raise a cloud of debris while using its Hover feat just as if it were a Large creature. Flying Charge (Ex) When a whirlmaw makes a charge attack while flying, it gains a +4 bonus on its attack roll (rather than the normal +2 bonus), and does not take the normal -2 penalty to Armor Class. Keen Sight (Ex) A whirlmaw is extremely sharp-sighted. It takes only half the penalty on Perception checks for distance, and can see creatures in open terrain clearly from up to a mile away.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Predators of the deep desert, whirlmaws are just one of the many dangers posed to those who travel the dry wastes of inner Rahadoum. Little more than flying eaters, these creatures rise singly or in flights, and attack all other living creatures that enter their territory. They are equally at home nestled in shallow burrows beneath sand dunes or resting in the rocky crevices of mountains. When they hunt, they soar upon the high thermals and keep an eye out for potential prey through the stony orbs that serve as their eyes. These bizarre hunters prefer to burrow into the torsos of their victims and consume the blood-rich organs, leaving the corpses' peripheral parts for scavengers. Few that encounter these vicious predators live to tell of it. The skeletal remains of whirlmaws' victims can be identified by the suspiciously circular sections of their torsos missing where the creatures burrowed through and consumed the flesh, bone, and organs in their entirety. The green, gemlike eyes of a whirlmaw are prized by those who seek exotic and dangerous treasures in the desert. It is speculated by some that these mystical orbs are the source of the whirlmaw's natural fire immunity, and alchemists and wizards often use them as components in creating magic items that bestow that form of energy resistance.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Entropic Breath (Su) Instead of a line of acid, a woundwyrm can exhale a 30-foot cone of acid fog (as the spell) that persists for 1 minute. Any creature that begins its turn within the entropic breath becomes confused (Will DC 25 negates) for as long as it remains within the cloud and for 1d6 rounds thereafter. Maw of the Abyss (Su) As a full-round action, a woundwyrm can attempt to suck creatures and unattended objects in a 15-foot cone into a vortex in its maw. This acts as a drag combat maneuver (CMB +30) against creatures, and acts as a Strength check with a +10 bonus to break objects. Unattended objects weighing less than 100 pounds are automatically drawn into its maw. Creatures and objects alike take 1d12 points of sonic damage per round within the cone. While using this ability, a woundwyrm cannot speak, use its breath weapon, or make attacks or attacks of opportunity with its bite attack.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Woundwyrms are ferocious predators native to the corrupted landscape of the Worldwound. They are equally at home in sea and sky, above the ground and below it. Oozing deliquescence seeps from between their cracked, rocky scales, and a constant fume of rainbow hues drifts out of their gullets, save when they inhale and ingest the very substance of disintegrating reality.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Bitter Flames (Su) Whenever Zelishkar deals fire damage with any attack or effect, half of the damage is fire damage and the other half is untyped damage, similar to a flame strike spell. In addition, creatures that fail a save against any fire effect Zelishkar creates are sickened for 1 minute. Those damaged by his melee attacks or by fire effects that allow no save are instead sickened for 1 round per attack. This duration stacks. Corpse Cremation (Su) Whenever Zelishkar reduces a living creature to negative hit points, as a swift action he can turn its body to ashes and feed upon the target's life force, as death knell (Will DC 28 negates). Whenever Zelishkar slays a creature with any attack or ability, the creature's corpse is reduced to ashes (treat as disintegrate). Daemonic Harbinger Traits A daemonic harbinger is a powerful daemon that has not yet made the full transition from unique daemon to a horseman. It possesses several traits, as summarized here. • Immunity to acid, charm and compulsion effects, death effects, disease, and poison. • Resistance to cold 30, electricity 30, and fire 30. • Telepathy 300 feet. • The harbinger's natural weapons, as well as any weapon it wields, are treated as evil and lawful for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. • The harbinger can grant spells to its worshipers. Granting spells does not require any specific action on its behalf. Zelishkar grants access to the domains of Evil, Law, Magic, and Trickery. His favored weapon is the quarterstaff. Incandescent Body (Su) As a free action, Zelishkar can cause his body to erupt into white-hot flame. He sheds light as bright as a daylight spell, and dazzles any creature that does not avert its gaze. Creatures with the fire subtype are immune to this dazzling effect. Zelishkar can dim his flames to burning black shadows as a free action, suppressing the dazzling effect and allowing him to use Stealth without penalty. Incendiary Grasp (Su) If Zelishkar hits a target with more than one natural weapon in the same round, the fire damage from each hit is combined as if from a single attack for the purpose of overcoming effects that provide resistance to fire. In addition, if Zelishkar succeeds at a grapple combat maneuver, as a swift action he can suppress any fire resistance or immunity the target possesses until the beginning of Zelishkar's next turn. Creatures with the fire subtype are immune to this effect, unless that subtype is granted by a temporary magical effect or magic item.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The dread Zelishkar of the Bitter Flame is a figure much feared on the crumbling plains of Abaddon and across the multiverse. A monstrous feline in shape but seemingly sculpted of lurid crimson flame, Zelishkar is girded with a crest and cuirass of infernally strengthened obsidian, shaved to razor thinness yet losing none of its terrible strength. His eyes are jet-black pits that mirror his armor, though pinpoints of awful orange radiance gleam deep within. He is surrounded always by a heat shimmer that diffuses his blinding radiance. Zelishkar is reputed to sense the presence of his prey by the tiniest variations in temperature, tracking the movements of creatures both seen and unseen before he pounces. His own fires burn with a hellish uncleanness, tainting even those who thought themselves proofed against his flames and rapidly consuming their body and soul, leaving nothing behind but befouled ashes. Zelishkar is feared as much for his incisive tactical acumen as for his dreadful and terrifying powers in close combat. He has single-handedly withered and despoiled cities and farmlands when summoned in the name of his daemonic mistress-Szuriel, patron of war and suffering. She forged Zelishkar's form in the deepest pits of the Cinder Furnace as her terrifying harbinger, embodying the hopeless misery of funeral pyres that consume and cremate the dead in the wake of the war that she brings. He proved so adept that she judged him worthy to transcend his purpose, and he has come to embody all of the hateful and sadistic purposes that fire serves. His name is invoked now by torturers and inquisitors alike as they consign their hapless captives to the ultimate agonies of being burned alive, and even by arsonists both petty and grand. All twisted souls who love nothing more than to see the world burn offer up silent praises to Zelishkar in their hearts; even if they never speak his name, the hate that burns within them is a sweet savor in his nostrils. Zelishkar was summoned to Golarion in ancient times, during the height of Osirion's empire, and he led legions of flaming minions against the enemies of the Pharaoh of Forgotten Plagues, notably the Jistka Imperium. In a twist of supreme hubris, the Pharaoh of Forgotten Plagues turned against his summoned ally after several successful campaigns, and chose Zelishkar to be the test subject of his grandest experiment yet. The Osirian king had just finished construction of a grand labyrinth south of the Alamein Peninsula, and in a display of prideful foolishness ordered Zelishkar to be imprisoned within to prove the infallibility of his maze. It took the efforts of an entire army of summoned genies to lock the daemonic harbinger away beneath the desert's churning sands, but his imprisonment was absolute with the aid of an ancient efreeti and a legendary artifact known as the Bottle of the Bound. Through all the long millennia since, Zelishkar and the remnant of his host have remained imprisoned beneath the Labyrinth of Shiman-Sekh, the city founded by the Song Pharaoh upon her victory over the Pharaoh of Forgotten Plagues years after Zelishkar's detention. He has emerged from his prison but once, when Szuriel and the ironically named Incorruptible Pharaoh joined to loose his fiery fury upon one of the sky-cities of Shory. His destructive rampage could not be contained, however, and he devastated several cities and oases of western Osirion before he and his host were finally bound back within their prison. There he remains, plotting burning vengeance upon Osirion and all of Golarion for his ages of durance vile.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Breath Weapon (Su) Once every minute, a bhole can expel a prodigious amount of thick slime from its gullet. This breath weapon has a range of 900 feet, and creates a 40-foot-diameter spread of slime in its targeted area. Any creature within this area must succeed at a DC 29 Fortitude save to avoid being stunned for 1d4 rounds. The slime transforms the area it coats into difficult terrain. Furthermore, any creature that is in the area (or that attempts to enter the area) must succeed at a DC 29 Reflex save to avoid becoming entangled by the slime. Bhole slime persists for 2d6 hours-bhole lairs are typically pre-caked with the stuff. A bhole can move through bhole slime without penalty. The save DC is Constitution-based. Immune to Magical Control (Ex) A bhole is immune to nearly all forms of mind control, including all charm spells, suggestion spells, and dominate spells. It is similarly immune to magic jar and possession attempts. Confusion and other mind-affecting effects that don't allow another creature to directly control a bhole work normally. Rare effects that allow a creature to manipulate the exact effects of confusion on a creature provide one of the few ways to magically control a bhole. Other methods, particularly those tied to strange and powerful artifacts, may work as well. Overwhelming Strength (Ex) A bhole always applies 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier on all natural weapon attacks.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Known on some worlds as dholes, bholes are among the largest of living creatures, wormlike leviathans of such size that few can claim to have seen one wholly from head to tail, and those who do tend toward madness and other aff lictions that carry with them a heavy burden of doubt. The coloration of these creatures' coiling bodies ranges widely-from darker blues and purples to paler grays, yellows, or bleached white-with a cavernous mouth consisting of long, bony jaws that extend and unfold from the creature's head when it feeds. Ecology By all accounts, bholes are incredibly long-lived-those that exist in remote worlds or on other dimensions have done so for countless eons. The bholes themselves seem to have no interest in their history, perhaps as a result of their limited intellect, but by all accounts a bhole can live forever, barring death by violence. For a creature as immense and dangerous as a bhole, such conditions essentially amount to immortality. Regions inhabited by bholes are always barren wastelands. What creatures survive there do so with a combination of stealth and speed, and even then they quickly learn to make themselves scarce when the telltale rumbling of an approaching bhole begins to shake the ground. Bholes themselves seem able to eat and digest anything and everything, and in time can reduce a huge area to a honeycombed network of immense tunnels. These regions swiftly collapse, leaving behind crumpled, rubble-filled pits of vast and terrifying size. Legends speak of entire worlds being reduced to rubble by bholes-they also tell of the danger of allowing these monsters into inhabited worlds, for their hunger is eternal, and a relatively small number of bholes can do incredible damage on a continental scale. Habitat &amp; Society Legends state that even larger bholes exist in distant realms below the Dimension of Dreams or deep under Leng. These legends state that no one has actually seen one of these truly enormous bholes; while someone must have witnessed one for the legend to spread, the number of those who have survived an encounter with a bhole with body and mind intact is so small that the hyperbole is for all intents and purposes the truth. Certainly the immense burrows in certain regions of the underworld below Leng or the Dimension of Dream speak of massive creatures indeed-holes into which typical bholes might fall and vanish forever. If these monsters do indeed exist, they do so on a scale that may make them impossible denizens of such constraining habitats as mere planets. Bholes are more intelligent than animals, but only just. They rarely speak, and their vocabularies are generally limited to only a handful of words in ancient, mostly forgotten languages-those words they do know and speak in more widespread tongues are generally limited to a few phrases in Aklo. Yet bholes rarely have cause to speak, for little seems to interest them apart from eating and slithering. No active bholes currently exist on Golarion, although dormant ones may certainly dwell in the deepest reaches of the Darklands, or may well be trapped between this world and other dimensions. Explorers are most likely to encounter these creatures on other planes, other planets, or in other dimensions. Certain members of the cult of Groetus have long sought a way to bring bholes to Golarion, or if they already exist in its depths, methods of locating and awakening them, for what swifter doom could one bring to a planet than to infest it with creatures capable of coring it out as a worm might devour an apple from within? Encounters with Bholes A typical bhole is only 30 feet wide, yet is hundreds of feet long and weighs thousands of tons. Combat with such immense monsters might present some challenges for games based around miniatures and play mats. When you include an encounter with a bhole in such a game, it might be best to describe the immense worm as extruding itself out of the earth to attack those nearby-if the bhole needs to move, it simply burrows to a new location, sticks out its head, and starts attacking new targets. Alternatively, you can treat the bhole's head as its only actively dangerous portion. In this case, attacks directed at its immense body are irrelevant, with only those directed at its head (which consists of a 30-foot space) actually reducing its hit points. You might even run an encounter with a bhole using a truly enormous space on your Flip-Mat-a space of 100 feet or more, perhaps. This solution presents its own challenges, obviously, particularly if your gaming area lacks for space. Of course, if these options for handling immense monsters don't sit well with you, the best solution is to simply downsize bholes in your game; assume they coil up on themselves and fit entirely into their 30-foot space, with their length accounting for their unusually enormous reach. Finally, you might consider not using miniatures at all for a fight against a bhole, with the assumption that once combat begins, the immense monster poses a significant threat to all in the area and that even several rounds of flight might not put a victim outside the monster's reach. Pick the solution that works best for your style of game play; in the end, the point is that a fight with a bhole should be one that your players remember for a long time.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Deflecting Winds (Su) A flying polyp's control over wind allows it to surround itself with blasts of precisely aimed gusts, effectively granting the creature a +5 deflection bonus to its Armor Class and a +4 resistance bonus on Reflex saving throws. Partial Invisibility (Su) A flying polyp's body constantly flickers and shifts, passing from visibility to invisibility in a seemingly random pattern and often not wholly at once, leaving the creature's body in what appears to be multiple sections. This ability, combined with the flying polyp's amorphous, elastic form, makes it difficult to target a flying polyp, granting it a 20% miss chance against all attacks. By concentrating, a flying polyp can become fully invisible. Sucking Wind (Su) This attack allows the flying polyp to send an eerie "sucking" wind out to slow and eventually stop a creature's escape. The wind itself isn't particularly strong, but it creates a peculiar sucking sensation as if it were attempting to pull things back toward the flying polyp. Activating this ability is a full-round action for a flying polyp, and it must concentrate each round to maintain the sucking wind's effect, as if it were concentrating to maintain a spell duration. The sucking wind manifests as a 100-foot-radius spread, with the flying polyp at the center. Each round the polyp maintains concentration, the sucking wind's radius increases by 100 feet, to a maximum radius of a mile. A flying polyp can detect creatures within this area via tremorsense. As a free action, it can increase the effects of the sucking wind on up to five different creatures within the area at one time. Each targeted creature must succeed at a DC 26 Fortitude save each round it remains in the area of the sucking wind or be slowed until it leaves the area. A creature already under the effects of any slowing effect (such as from this sucking wind or a slow spell) that fails this save is held in place for 1 round-it is not helpless, but cannot move via any means. Freedom of movement protects against the effects of the sucking wind, and control winds negates its effects in the area of effect of the control winds spell. Natural windstorms or other powerful winds have no effect on a sucking wind. A flying polyp can activate a sucking wind once per day, and can maintain concentration on the effect for up to an hour. The save DC is Constitution-based. Wind Blast (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a flying polyp can create a powerful blast of wind at a range of up to 120 feet. This blast of wind creates a sudden explosion of flesh-scouring wind in a 30-foot-radius burst. All creatures within this area take 14d6 points of bludgeoning damage, with a successful DC 26 Reflex save halving the damage. In addition, these winds can check or blow away creatures as if they were tornado-strength winds (see page 439 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>A flying polyp is a hideous mass of flesh, eyes, tentacles, and mouths suggestive of a particularly nauseating evolutionary path. A typical flying polyp measures 30 feet in length but is unusually light for its size, weighing no more than 2,000 pounds. These creatures seem to have no maximum lifespan, but their violent, warlike nature ensures that death eventually occurs-even if it takes eons for the polyp to encounter something capable of defeating it. Ecology A flying polyp is a physical being, but one composed of material strangely unlike the flesh that garbs most living creatures. While the stuff that makes up the exterior of a flying polyp's body might seem similar to ordinary flesh, it often behaves in ways that should be impossible. The material seems to fade in and out of visibility, almost at random, at points becoming transparent enough that the nauseating inner workings of the thing's body are laid bare to view. Although the polyp feels moist and damp to the touch, what might serve as blood in other creatures behaves more like strange vortices of wind within a flying polyp's body. When wounded, its damaged flesh does not bleed so much as whistle and gust. A flying polyp's association with wind is particularly noteworthy, and goes far beyond the strange storms that surge through what passes as veins and arteries in its massive body. These creatures have a remarkable ability to control the air around them, both via a wide array of spell-like abilities and through the use of potent supernatural powers. They do not wield tools or weapons as a rule, instead using their mastery of the winds themselves to wage war and build their grim cities, scouring towers and chambers out of basalt with precise blasts of sand-laden wind. Habitat &amp; Society Although flying polyps certainly display some of the features of other sentient races, particularly in their habit of building cities (although these towering cities incorporate architectural features that most other races find awkward and unsettling), in other areas they seem strangely primitive or disinterested. They are as aberrant in mind and philosophy as they are in physical form. For example, they seem to have neither a name for their own race, nor a language to call their own. Their cities, while unnerving in their vast scale, seem to serve little other purpose than to unnerve, for flying polyps do not engage in trade or politics or other social constructs. The primary exception to this, to the detriment of other creatures unfortunate enough to dwell in regions claimed by flying polyps, is war. Flying polyps excel at genocide, using their mastery over wind to scour clean entire cities and civilizations when they come upon them. Some among their kind can even travel to other planets by bringing with them a sizable sphere of purloined wind and air to carry them aloft and sustain them, and with this power they lead armies from planet to planet as necessary, relentlessly tracking their chosen enemies across worlds. Every so often, flying polyps encounter a race that is their equal in war, and on some worlds, including Golarion, they still endure the humiliation of these ancient defeats after being imprisoned in extensive underground chambers where they are cut off from the outside world. Yet flying polyps are long-lived, and when an unforeseen tectonic event creates new exits to their prison chambers in forgotten corners of the Darklands, they emerge with unabated fury to seek revenge.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Divine Separation (Su) The herald has been separated from Lissala for thousands of years and does not know where her master is. The loss of her connection to the goddess severely weakens the herald, and she gains 1 negative level per day, up to a maximum of 16 negative levels. These negative levels cannot be suppressed or removed in any way (including restoration spells), except by using her feed ability. If Lissala returns and the herald regains her connection to her master, she permanently loses this weakness and its associated negative levels. Feed (Su) Once per day, the herald can devour an outsider's corpse as a full-round action. For each Hit Die of the devoured outsider, the herald automatically removes 1 negative level gained from her divine separation ability. The consumed outsider must have at least 8 Hit Dice. Intelligence Drain (Su) The herald drains 1d4 points of Intelligence each time she hits with her slam attack. (The herald does not heal any damage when she uses her Intelligence drain.) Power Surge (Su) Three times per day as a swift action, the herald can increase the DC of her next spell-like ability (if it is cast that round) by +2. Spell-Like Crafting (Su) The herald may use any of her spell-like abilities when crafting magic items as if they were actual spells.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Lissala's herald is Kurshu the Undying, a powerful and dutiful agent of magic who has been suffering in her master's long absence. Known as "Kurshu the Divine Serpent" during the time of Thassilon, she possesses a powerful serpentine lower body, a female humanoid upper body, and three pairs of feathered wings. Her humanoid half is more serpentine than that of a lillend; she has tiny scales on her arms and a scaly cobra hood that blends into her hair. She looks haggard, as if aff licted with a chronic wasting disease, and her movements betray an ancient and resigned weariness. Her voice is thin and susurrant, and she tends to hiss when she speaks, especially when angry. She tends to verbalize in Thassilonian even when communicating telepathically. She is a lost being without a purpose, devoted to Lissala but unable to find her. Records of the herald's origin are lost to passing centuries, but she claims she was created in her current form by the goddess, who used parts from several different creatures and then granted her true life. The goddess's withdrawal has taxed the herald's ability to maintain her own life, and eventually she may fragment back into her component pieces (which may or may not be alive after this transformation). Bound to Lissala by magic and an unshakable sense of duty, she resents her master for leaving her behind to wither away, and despises herself for knowing that if Lissala returns, she will crawl back to the goddess like a sheltered, neglected child who has no alternative but to love her creator and jailor. Ecology Kurshu's degenerative condition means that (unlike most outsiders) she must eat to survive; otherwise, she wastes away into a skeletal, nearly helpless version of herself. She reached that lowest point only once, but was lucky enough to catch suitable prey unawares and work her way back to an exhausted but functional level. Consequently, Kurshu makes sure to feed at least every few days. As there are few creatures in Lissala's service who have the power to conjure her, Kurshu is mainly left to her own devices, but (unlike heralds of active deities) may choose to respond to a summons from any spellcaster. In exchange for her services, she demands that she be given outsiders she can enslave for later feeding, Thassilonian magic items, or items that bear some lingering piece of Lissala's power. She is knowledgeable about Thassilonian magic, rune magic, and Azlanti practices, though she is hesitant to speak of the latter when on Golarion lest it attract unwanted attention from slaves of the aboleths; having witnessed Earthfall at a distance, she has no desire to subject herself to a direct attack by entities who control that kind of magic. Kurshu has no compunction about killing something that defies her or appears to be withholding information or objects she wants (if she has to, she can compel answers from its corpse using limited wish to duplicate speak with dead). She feels her pseudo-mortality at all times and fears death, and is likely to flee any encounter in which she feels outmatched. Habitat &amp; Society Kurshu is alone in the multiverse. Her goddess is gone, Lissala's other divine servants have perished or converted to other faiths, mortals who knew her at the height of Thassilon are long dead or in suspended animation, and her existence has no purpose. Her hunger for outsider souls repulses her (as she never had to eat while Lissala was present) but she accepts it as a necessary embarrassment because she is unwilling to accept death-or an eternity spent as an invalid. She normally keeps a "stable" of charmed outsiders near her (using her limited wish spell-like ability to duplicate charm monster) so she can slay and consume one if necessary. Her devotion to law and hatred of chaos means her minions are usually daemons, demons, or proteans; though she finds their flesh repugnant, she would rather destroy a minion of disorder than a devil or similar lawful evil outsider. She is stern but courteous to these minions, who obey and respect her power even beyond the enforced friendliness of the magic that binds them to her. Because of her chaotic associates, she has survived many hostile encounters in which opponents attacked her with lawful magic (such as order's wrath)-such attacks do not harm her, giving her a few vital seconds to decide whether she wants to retaliate or abandon her minions and flee. The herald spends her infinite hours wandering the planes in search of Lissala or visiting Golarion to bask in places sacred to her missing goddess, trying to detect echoes of her master's presence like an old widower smelling his dead wife's clothes for a hint of perfume to spark a long-forgotten memory.</Description>

    <Description_Visual>This lanky ebon humanoid has batlike wings and a long prehensile tail, yet its most unsettling feature is its lack of a face.</Description_Visual>
    <Source>AP 65</Source>
    <IsTemplate>0</IsTemplate>
    <SpecialAbilities>Clutches (Ex) Although a typical nightgaunt stands only half a foot taller than most humans, it is a remarkably tenacious grappler. A nightgaunt gains a +8 racial bonus on all combat maneuver checks made to grapple (rather than the typical +4 bonus most creatures with the grab ability gain). If a nightgaunt uses its fly speed to move itself and a grappled target, it can fly at full speed. Faceless (Ex) A nightgaunt has no face, yet it can still see with remarkable clarity in all directions as if its entire body were a single strange eye. This unusual form of vision renders it immune to gaze attacks, but not to illusions that rely upon vision to function. A nightgaunt feeds on the despair and horror of its victims, which replaces the creature's need to eat and drink. It has no need to breathe at all, and is immune to all inhaled or scent-based effects. Tickle (Ex) A nightgaunt's long, sinuous tail is covered with razor-sharp barbs. While this appendage looks dangerous and is exceptionally agile, a nightgaunt's tail doesn't have much strength, and thus cannot be used as a natural weapon. Yet when a nightgaunt grapples a foe, its tail can slither along the target's flesh to tickle and tease with nauseating efficiency. Tickling a foe is a swift action, and the foe must either be helpless or grappled by the nightgaunt in order for it to use this ability. When a creature is tickled by a nightgaunt, the victim must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. The save DC is Dexterity-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Nightgaunts haunt the deepest and darkest chasms of dream. They lurk in the shadows that loom at the edges of sane slumber, but are ready at any moment to snatch a blithe dreamer away, carrying it off into realms of endless nightmare and tickling it terribly all the way. They appear as stooped, emaciated humanoids, yet possess a strength in their sinewy limbs that far surpasses that of most humans. With inky black skin, batlike wings, long spiny tails, and demonic horns protruding from their skulls, nightgaunts are fearsome foes-yet it's their lack of any facial features makes the creatures truly nightmarish. A typical nightgaunt is 7 feet tall and weighs 175 pounds. Ecology Nightgaunts' most singular feature-their uncanny lack of features-is perhaps their most intriguing biological facet. That the creatures can see is manifestly obvious, for they react to purely visual stimulus with speed and precise action, as if their whole bodies can see in all directions. Scholars have yet to determine how the bizarre creatures accomplish this eerie stunt, but the fact that they were spawned originally in the depths of ancient nightmares might indicate that no sane or logical explanation for their sight exists. Nightgaunts feed on emotions; while fear and horror are the usual staples of nightgaunts' diet, the creatures actually prefer a meal of varied emotions. A mix of laughter and terror provides a succulent meal for nightgaunts. Little else can provoke as delectable a bouquet for a nightgaunt as lifting victims high into the air while tickling them with its long, whip-like tail, a situation that those who have survived relate as one that can never be forgotten. During this frightening feeding, a nightgaunt often carries its victims aloft for miles as it continually tickles and torments the poor souls, finally dropping its prey into a remote area where monsters and worse lie in wait once it has gorged itself. Although nightgaunts won't hesitate to drop particularly troublesome or dangerous creatures from a great height, they prefer to release those they carry off from heights of only a few feet, as if to ensure their survival in whatever eldritch wilderness the nightgaunts have brought their victims to. Nightgaunts rarely return to feed on creatures they've dropped off in a dangerous region (although the same cannot be said of victims who escape to safety), provoking theories that the creatures have some sort of ancient pact with the monstrous denizens of these remote locales. Habitat &amp; Society Nightgaunts dwell in the parts of the world that inspire nightmares, where dreamers pray for dawn. They can be found amid the creaking boughs of haunted forests, lurking in the caves of desolate mountain gorges, or perched atop crumbling gravestones in forgotten boneyards. Yet when they grow hungry, they take wing from their eerie lairs to seek out victims, scouring cities and towns for open windows from which to snatch their meals. Although nightgaunts can be found throughout Golarion, this is not their original home. The first nightgaunts were spawned deep in the Dimension of Dream from the nightmares of a forgotten poet whose fears were so consuming that every night he dreamt, his nightmares grew more and more powerful and overwhelming. Dreams of being carried over horrific landscapes and mind-numbing vistas of eldritch blight drove the poet deeper and deeper into madness, and in desperation he sought out the aid of a strange alchemist who supplied him with an elixir that would rid him of his fears forever. The poet took the draught and immediately fell into a deep slumber, and in that slumber, his nightmares fled his mind, transforming into the first and most powerful of the nightgaunt race. Unfortunately for the poet, the nightgaunts also took his muse, and when he woke the next morning, he found his ability to write had vanished forever-he had traded his soul for a life of gentle sleep. When he found he could not go on without his poetry, he sought out that strange alchemist in hopes of reversing what he'd done. The stories do not reveal what fate eventually met this strange and forlorn poet, but the nightgaunts have certainly prospered. Most nightgaunts have little drive to be anything more than predators of slumbering societies. They often gather in large colonies, entertaining each other by sharing emotions they've fed upon via strange touches and lingering caresses. Powerful warlords, wizards, priests, and the like often enjoin nightgaunts to serve them as guardians or even forms of travel, promising them slaves or other captured prey in return for their services, but those who traffic with nightgaunts must take care to stay in their faceless friends' good graces, for a nightgaunt can turn upon its allies at the smallest slight. Nightgaunts often war with the other creatures found in their desolate realms, led into battle by elder nightgaunts who carry strange magical tridents and command considerable magical powers. These elder nightgaunts typically have levels as magi or oracles-a nightgaunt colony led by such a powerful creature is a much more dangerous threat than most, for these colonies often have agendas that go beyond mere predation upon kinder societies. Nightgaunt elders are typically chaotic evil, and many use their followers to keep humanoids as cattle in horrific pens or cages in lightless caverns. The most powerful nightgaunts, though, are those original creations pulled from the mad poet's nightmares. These creatures are all-powerful spellcasters of prodigious size, and dwell in the deep underground realms below the Dimension of Dream, or else rule vast rookeries on the ragged borderlands that surround the dread Plateau of Leng. What their goals might be is not for sane minds to know.</Description>

    <Description>Sometimes a pregnant death worm lays an especially promising egg among her brood, about twice as large as the others and with a nigh-impenetrable, brown-speckled shell. This egg requires even more warmth than the others in its clutch, and upon emerging the worm would rather devour its brethren than the meal left by its parent. Such rare specimens grow up to become death worm leviathans, and those few who have heard of the fell beasts know to fear them as well as to hold them in awe. Death worm leviathans possess powers nearly identical to those of their smaller kin, albeit at a much deadlier scale. In addition, their massive girth makes it even easier for them to consume prey both large and small, and a single leviathan might consume an entire desert village before its terrible hunger is sated.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Whip Tail (Ex) When not submerged, a mokele-mbembe can crack its tail as a standard action, creating a sonic boom in a 5-foot burst, up to 20 feet away. Any creature in the burst's area must succeed at a DC 21 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based. Other mokele-mbembe are immune to this effect.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The mokele-mbembe is a predatory saurian that measures up to 40 feet in length and weighs up to 10 tons. Inhabitants of the deep tropics, mokele-mbembe dwell in lakes, rivers, swamps and other aquatic regions where they feed on fish, birds, small mammals, and even reptiles. When food runs short and mokele-mbembe grow hungry, they have been known to seek prey from local tribes and villages. Despite being an aggressive hunter, a mokele-mbembe shares some traits with nonpredatory sauropods. Its body is massive and elephantine, with four long legs that end in webbed feet. Its neck is long and flexible like that of herbivorous dinosaurs or giraffes, but its head is triangular, with strong jaws and sharp teeth like a carnivore. A mokele-mbembe's hide is mottled greenish-brown and has the texture of tree bark. Large, defensive spines grow from its back. The mokele-mbembe's natural habitat normally lies far from populous regions. For this reason, they are rarely glimpsed by outsiders, though they are well known to locals who hunt in such lands. Many stories are told about the creatures' size, strength, and ferocity, and some groups even believe them to have a special sacred status as messengers of the gods-or agents of their wrath.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Bay (Su) When the Sandpoint Devil screams as a standard action, all creatures within a 300-foot-radius spread must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or become panicked for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic, mind-affecting fear effect. Whether or not their saves are successful, creatures within the effect are immune to the Sandpoint Devil's bay for 24 hours thereafter. The save DC is Charisma-based. Hellfire Breath (Su) Once every 1d4 rounds, the Sandpoint Devil can unleash a blast of infernal flame from its mouth as a standard action. This hellfire fills a 30-foot cone and deals 10d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 20 half ). Anyone who takes damage from this breath weapon must also succeed at a DC 20 Will save to avoid becoming cursed by the infernal flames. Those who become cursed take a -4 penalty on all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks for a number of days equal to the damage taken, and during this time, the victim's skin appears to be horribly burned in places regardless of any healing applied. This curse effect functions at caster level 12th. The save DC for both saves is Constitution-based. Kick (Ex) The Sandpoint Devil's hoof attacks are primary attacks that deal bludgeoning and slashing damage.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>When residents of the small town of Sandpoint on the southwestern coast of Varisia speak in low voices about "the devil," they mean the dreadful creature that has menaced the community and its hinterlands for over a decade. Then again, most people don't speak of the Sandpoint Devil if they can help it. They say the monster knows when someone is talking about it, and a poor soul who can't hold his tongue is likely to glimpse the creature's grotesque silhouette in the sky on the next moonless night-an ill omen indeed. According to legend, sightings of the Sandpoint Devil presage times of great woe, whether for a single person or the entire town. Sometimes, those who see the creature or speak of it too freely vanish in the night, never to be seen again. Precise descriptions of the Sandpoint Devil vary depending on whom you ask, but most people agree that it resembles a large horse standing upright on its hind legs with leathery, ragged wings; a reptilian tail; red eyes that burn through the gloom; and a fanged muzzle that gives the creature a perpetual evil grin. Some say the devil commands fog and wind, others say it breathes gouts of flame or can literally frighten you to death, and still others say it can do all this and more. Whenever livestock are slaughtered in their pens or children disappear from their beds, townsfolk are quick to blame the Sandpoint Devil. The beast is also denounced (quietly) when a building burns to the ground or a farmer's crops wither. In short, the locals hang nearly all their ills on the devil. But not all residents consider it to be evil. Some believe that the creature is an ancient guardian of the Lost Coast, and its actions in service of that goal, however terrible they might seem, are not for mortals to understand. Of course, hearsay and rumors only go so far, and most people outside the region consider the Sandpoint Devil a tall tale at best. At worst, they say it's a hoax perpetrated by simple folk looking for attention or hoping to draw travelers and adventurers with coin to spend.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Mutable Polymorph (Su) When using spells with the polymorph descriptor, raelises have an uncanny amount of control over their target shape. While they still cannot use the spells to transform into specific individuals, they can control the skin tone, the hair color, the general body shape, and even the gender of the creature they transform into, granting them a +20 bonus on Disguise checks instead of the usual +10. This is a free action made as part of the spellcasting. Rune Mastery (Ex) Raelises are masters of all magic based on runes or symbols. They automatically add explosive runes, glyph of warding, greater glyph of warding, sepia snake sigil, and all symbol spells to their list of spells known and increase the DC for these spells by 1. Additionally, raelises are immune to magical traps and effects that utilize runes or symbols, such as sepia snake sigil and explosive runes. Spells A raelis casts spells as a 12th-level sorcerer. It has no sorcerer bloodline and does not gain any other sorcerer class abilities. Stun (Ex) A raelis's iron-hard fist delivers a powerful, stunning blow. A creature struck by this attack must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or be dazed for 1 round. If the attack is a critical hit and the target fails its save, the creature is instead stunned for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Strength-based. Word Caller (Su) Raelises automatically sense the presence and basic topic of any books, scrolls, or other writings within 50 feet. By spending a standard action, they gain a deeper understanding of the text, treating up to 100 pages of nonmagical writing as if they had read it, or treating one magical spell or scroll as if they had read it and successfully made a successful Spellcraft check to understand it.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Formed from the souls of authors, artists, and storytellers, raelises travel to the farthest corners of Golarion and beyond searching for epic stories, poems, and simple tall tales. As they travel and quest for ever more obscure tales, they strive to make the world a brighter place-setting wrongs right or acting as agents for divine beings. Though raelises appear to be frail, they possess a wiry strength and long-fingered hands ideally suited for the brawling and wrestling they enjoy so much. Deep brown or gray eyes dominate their expressive faces, and smiles and laughter come easy to their lips. Newly formed raelises have fair skin, but it slowly darkens over the centuries as they spend long hours exposed to the sun and elements. A raelis stands 9 feet tall and weighs close to 1,000 pounds. Ecology The lust for new tales and stories drives raelises to the mortal planes more often than most of their azata brethren. Unable to just stand idly by, raelises aid mortals more frequently than do other azatas, though they almost always do so disguised as humans or sometimes even common or familiar animals. Raelises prefer to avoid physical confrontation when dealing with mortals, but don't hesitate to inf luence events in other ways. A raelis might travel from town to town spreading tales and news to encourage rebellion in a poorly run kingdom, or insinuate itself into an invader's army to sow dissension. Often a raelis's inf luence isn't felt until it is long gone, as raelises use their powers to bend minds in subtle ways to plant the seeds of change. Essentially gender neuter in their natural form, raelises have an androgynous beauty to their lean, sculpted bodies. When altering their physical form via alter self or other magical abilities, they can choose to take on male or female forms. Younger raelises often have a preferred gender, but as they get older, raelises choose their gender based on mood or as the task in front of them demands. They occasionally tryst with mortals, though their lack of stable gender identity sometimes leads to confusion. Ironically, bards and storytellers are the mortals least likely to receive the aid of a raelis azata. Raelises almost universally believe the best mortal works are born of strife and crisis. Shielding a known storyteller from the trials of life could very well prevent the greatest epics from being written. Exactly how far they are willing to let things go is a matter of preference and a frequent topic of debate among their kind. Raelises like to compare the trials and suffering of storytellers to the fire and anvil that forges a great sword. Raelises do not enjoy this suffering, however, and those who deliberately abuse or murder a storyteller while a raelis is near discover swift justice after the fact. Traveling is raelises' second love; they pride themselves on their knowledge of obscure back roads and trails. While they all have favored trails, raelises consider it a bad omen to make the exact same journey twice and they go long distances out of their way to avoid doing so. After eons exploring in this manner, the average raelis becomes a living atlas. Though competent flyers, raelises prefer to walk or even run when they travel. Even on the coldest and hottest of days they travel with their feet bare. They love the feel of grass or even mud between their long toes, and pass time reciting stories they have collected, getting a feel for the flow of the verse and the rhythm of the words. Raelises can run for days at a time without stopping to rest or even sleep, crossing great distances or just scouting all available roads and trails in an area. Habitat &amp; Society Their ability to travel discretely and their familiarity with the cities and geography of Golarion make raelises excellent spies and agents for deities with similar interests. While they avoid long-lasting alliances, raelises have much in common with the Empyreal Lord Sinashakti and often find themselves exchanging favors with him. Less frequently, they strike bargains with Cayden Cailean or even Desna in exchange for small favors or information. Though many raelises are poets and storytellers, they value the stories mortals create. Few raelises worry overmuch about the accuracy of any given story-they are more interested in the art of the telling rather than the veracity of the tale. Some raelises even prefer the most outlandish tall tales and outright fabrications, as long as the exaggeration furthers the story.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Adamantine Weapons (Ex) The teeth and claws of a clockwork dragon are made of adamantine, and have the qualities of a weapon made from that material. Efficient Winding (Ex) Built for deployment on long and dangerous missions, a clockwork dragon can function for 3 days per Hit Die every time it is wound. Exceptional Perception (Ex) A clockwork dragon construction includes magical enhancements that grant the creature particularly keen senses. In addition to its +8 racial bonus on Perception checks, a clockwork dragon can detect invisible creatures as if it were under the effect of a permanent see invisibility spell. Noqual Scales (Ex) The noqual alloy from which a clockwork dragon's scales are crafted grants the creature spell resistance. In addition, a clockwork dragon gains a +4 resistance bonus on any saving throw made against a magical source. Powered by Abysium (Ex) A clockwork dragon's bite carries with it a dangerous poison rendered from the skymetal abysium. The clockwork dragon need not deal damage to affect its target with this affliction. If the clockwork dragon's bite attack is sufficient to hit the creature's touch AC or if the dragon's bite hits but damage reduction negates any damage dealt, the target is affected with abysium exposure. Abysium Exposure: Poison-contact; save Fortitude DC 18; onset 1 minute; frequency 1/minute for 6 minutes; effect 1d4 Con plus nauseated; cure 2 saves. Self-Destruction (Ex) When reduced to below half of its hit points, a clockwork dragon can trigger a reaction that causes its body to self-destruct in a fiery explosion that deals 20d8 points of fire damage in a 20-foot radius. This violent explosion superheats the various volatile materials that make up the clockwork creation and spreads the risk of abysium exposure to all creatures that are within a 300-foot radius.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The magic-wielding engineers of ancient Azlant created marvelous clockwork creations, but few equaled the formidable power of the clockwork dragon. The construction of clockwork dragons was based on a similar design, that of the clockwork leviathan. The Azlanti engineers used the leviathan as a basic chassis, borrowing the same technology to fully waterproof the creature, then further modified the clockwork monstrosity to specialize it for defense and fast, brutal attacks. The Azlanti focused on clockworks because they knew that the aboleths' illusions and magic meant to trick the mind would be useless against their mechanical creations, and began amassing clockwork armies of various shapes and uses to fight against their sinister rivals. In addition to being sent to war against aboleths, clockwork dragons were also used by the Azlanti against other threats, such as the serpentfolk, and later the Ghol-Gani cyclopes. Most of the time, clockwork dragons are built to represent metallic dragons, though some creators designed their mechanical beasts to resemble dragons of the chromatic grouping. Preserved illustrations unearthed from Thassilonian archaeological sites show even primal and imperial dragons inf luenced some designs. It is rumored that an improved version of the clockwork dragon's design possessed a semblance of sentience, having the ability to alter their programming mid-mission. Other variants of clockwork dragons wield breath weapons that deal alternate forms of energy damage. The greatest example of these variants is said to be capable of blasting a line of force from its fanged mouth. Some even claim to have spotted a similar creature in Numeria (likely a product of parallel design): a robotic creation outfitted with enhanced flight, keen senses, lasers, and self-propelled explosive devices. The Azlanti engineers who first crafted these creations made use of some of the rarest elements available. This included the various skymetals, and in the creation of the clockwork dragons, the engineers discovered many new uses for those metals. Through their research, they found a more efficient way to work noqual and discovered the safest methods of working with abysium. According to some reports, though the material was never used for clockwork dragons as far as anyone knows for sure, the engineers even discovered a way to alloy djezet. The inclusion of abysium shows that the clockwork dragons were not necessarily designed to win their particular battles, and some claim the elaborate devices were never intended to return once successful. The Azlanti could send these skymetal-infused creatures at their enemies as a first strike, sickening whole groups from exposure to abysium and thus weakening the targets for the Azlanti soldiers who followed. Ecology Clockwork dragons must be wound up to perform, and though a full winding lasts much longer for these creations than other clockwork creatures, they eventually use up their power and go dormant. Most clockwork dragons in Golarion remain in this dormant state, awaiting a fresh winding. Habitat &amp; Society Clockwork dragons were most plentiful in Azlant, though in Avistan, Thassilonian builders were also known to create the elaborate creatures for use in war. As constructs, the creatures have no true society, but many clockwork dragons were deployed with a contingent of clockwork servants to attend to their winding and repairs. Some clockwork dragons were also built with tiny compartments in their bodies that housed a dozen clockwork spies they could deploy during their missions so they could provide their creators with a full report of the particular action in which they were involved. Most of the time, these tiny clockwork spies cling to the dragon while it is in action, scurrying over its metallic scales as the beast pursues its quarry. Construction The clockwork dragon is a masterpiece of Azlanti technology and is exceptionally difficult to create. In addition, the inclusion of skymetals makes clockwork dragons much more expensive than normal clockwork creations of the same size. The creator must begin with crafted clockwork pieces and various skymetals worth 25,000 gp. Clockwork Dragon CL 18th; Price 300,000 gp CONSTRUCTION Requirements Craft Construct, animate objects, geas/quest, and limited wish, creator must be at least caster level 16th; Skill Craft (clockwork) DC 25; Cost 175,000 gp</Description>

    <IsTemplate>0</IsTemplate>
    <SpecialAbilities>Camouflage (Ex) A living rune is able to shift its coloration and form to blend into its surroundings. The creature automatically hits with its touch attack against any creature that fails to notice it and enters its square. Glyph Touch (Su) A living rune deals 3d8 points of electricity damage with a successful touch attack, and it uses its Dexterity modifier (instead of its Strength modifier) to resolve all touch attacks. Immunity to Magic (Ex) A living rune is immune to spells and spell-like abilities that allow spell resistance. In addition, certain other spells and effects function differently against the creature as noted below. • An erase spell deals 6d6 points of damage to a living rune. • A living rune caught in the radius of any symbol spell is immune to its effects and heals 1d8 points of damage per spell level. Hit points beyond its total maximum are gained as temporary hit points that fade in 1 hour. • A living rune is affected normally by magic missile, maze, and spells that deal sonic damage. Symbols of Power (Su) As a standard action, a living rune can shift its form into a number of powerful symbols whose effects can damage or incapacitate opponents. Each round the living rune can choose a new effect, but a particular symbol form can only be used once every 4 rounds. This attack is resolved with a touch attack and the save DC is Charisma-based. Fear: The target becomes panicked for 2d6 rounds (Will DC 24). Pain: The target suffers wracking pains that impose a -4 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks for 1 hour (Fort DC 24). Persuasion: The target is charmed by the living rune (as charm monster) for 2d6 hours (Will DC 24). Slow: The target is slowed (as the slow spell) for 12 rounds (Will DC 24). Stunning: The target is stunned for 1d6 rounds (Fort DC 24). Weakness: The target suffers crippling weakness that deals 2d6 points of Strength damage (Fort DC 24). Truescript (Su) A living rune can sculpt its form into complicated scripts and pictographs that can be understood by any creature with the ability to read written language. A living rune can also understand any written or spoken language. Two-Dimensional (Ex) A living rune only exists in two dimensions, and has some qualities in common with incorporeal creatures. A living rune has no Strength score. It cannot move in three dimensions (such as jumping or flying), and can only navigate along solid surfaces such as floors, ceilings, and walls. It can only attack creatures by entering their squares and touching them directly. A living rune can crawl onto solid surfaces that can then themselves be moved (such as onto a tome via its telekinesis spell-like ability). It cannot fall or take falling damage, cannot make trip or grapple attacks, and cannot be tripped or grappled. It cannot take any physical action that would move or manipulate an opponent or the opponent's equipment, has no weight, and does not set off traps that are triggered by weight. A living rune takes no damage from nonmagical attacks and only takes half damage from magical weapons.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Whether first scribed by some forgotten deity or birthed by magic glyphs long soured, living runes are among the most stubborn and arrogant of dungeon denizens. Though two-dimensional and lacking any sort of real body, the creatures are sentient, but with a venomous hostility toward the so-called "lesser races" they feel are corrupted forms of the universe's first words of creation. Appearing as magical glyphs, animated pulsating runes, etched hieroglyphics, or even ancient cave art, these creatures live to prey on lesser beings for no other reason than to prove their superiority over flesh-and-blood creatures. Ecology Living runes are ambush hunters, lying in wait amid ancient graffiti and faded pictographs, or even on the pages of ancient texts and tomes. They use their mutable forms to camouf lage themselves-often changing texts with illusory script to lead adventurers into nearby traps or hazards, or lacing important sources of information with explosive runes and then striking at trespassers when they have triggered the dangerous glyphs. Immortal unless destroyed, the creatures do not need sustenance in a traditional sense, though, like their will-o'-wisp cousins, they seem to feed on the terror and pain they induce in their victims. In addition to fear and pain, living runes feed on the written word (which they can erase through this consumption or leave unharmed). Living runes reproduce by a strange sort of mitosis, where two creatures merge to create complex sentence structures and concepts before splitting a portion off each of their malleable bodies to create a new unique rune that contains the knowledge of both parent runes. Habitat &amp; Society Most commonly found in deserted ruins-in particular old alchemical labs, forgotten temples, and musty libraries- living runes prefer to live isolated existences, feeding on lost knowledge, consuming it slowly over the years before erasing or altering it, then hoarding the truth within themselves to tease races seeking to recover it. For this reason, they prefer to haunt the fringes of civilization, where they may terrorize lesser creatures in this manner- particularly arcane spellcasters. They derive a sick pleasure from the mental and physical torture of humanoids; in particular, they enjoy cornering humanoids in debates and wrapping them in riddles with the promise of shared knowledge or information, before ultimately growing bored and attacking the intruders with their myriad abilities. Such communications always begin-in the living rune's unique form of communication-with scribbled inquiries trespassing creatures will understand, and this somewhat playful and innocuous introduction often draws explorers to their deaths when they assume they are conversing with some benign artificial intelligence. In instances becoming horrifically frequent, archivists have discovered previously unheard of colonies of living runes deep in the bowels of urban libraries and archives, hiding out for years in an attempt to learn more of modern civilization, with unknown motivations that may hold terrible consequences for civilized races. Origins In the annals of recorded history, ancient texts mentioning living runes always seem to do so in relation to the forgotten goddess Lissala, leading scholars to believe that either the creatures served worshipers of the deity in some way, or were rewarded as gifts to particularly devout supplicants. Some even speculate that Lissala herself is responsible for the creation of living runes. Others conjecture that living runes have always been, and are among the universe's eldest creatures, having escaped from the lips of some primordial god when the first words of creation were uttered. Evidence seems to dispute both these claims-the creatures are known to spring up from the scribbled text and graffiti of magic-soured ruins or untriggered symbol spells long left to rot. Whatever the truth, these haughty creatures do not discuss their origins.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Morphic Body (Ex) A mezlan can assume the appearance of any Medium or Small creature (other than creatures with the elemental, incorporeal, or swarm subtypes-the body assumed must be solid). The mezlan's creature type doesn't change in this new form and it gains none of the mimicked creature's special abilities; the transformation is cosmetic only. In these other forms, the mezlan retains all of its normal statistics and abilities as depicted above. Though this ability only affects the mezlan's outward image, it is a transmutation effect. Morphic Weapons (Ex) A mezlan can manipulate its body to mimic a wide array of potent weaponry wielded by its various forms. While the weapons may look different, they are considered natural weapons and they all do the same amount of damage; are treated as magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction; and deal bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. Once per round, a mezlan can extend one of its limbs to strike at a distance up to 15 feet away with one of its slam attacks. Also, while mimicking a creature wielding a ranged weapon, a mezlan can fire a portion of its body as if the fragment were a projectile. This projectile is treated as a thrown weapon and has a range increment of 60 feet. Skill Pool (Ex) A mezlan has a special knack for solving problems. Five times per day, it can apply a +4 competence bonus on any skill check, even checks for skills it has no ranks in or skills that can only be used untrained. Spell Battery (Su) A mezlan can store up to 10 levels of spells that it can then cast freely. The spells imbued into a mezlan are each activated with the casting time for the relevant spell and are cast at the caster level of the spellcaster who provided the spells. A mezlan can store and use both divine and arcane spells, and can be imbued by any number of casters at a time. To fuel this ability, a caster must cast her spells into the mezlan; alternatively, the spellcaster can use a scroll to place a spell into the mezlan. A mezlan must voluntarily lower its spell resistance in order to be imbued with spells. In addition, a mezlan can choose to lower its spell resistance and absorb spells cast at it. The mezlan must be aware of the incoming spell and ready an action to absorb it. Only spells that have the mezlan as a target can be absorbed in this way; area spells are not absorbed. If a mezlan already possesses 10 levels of spells, it cannot absorb more. The mezlan can use these absorbed spells as its own. Versatile Speech (Ex) A mezlan has a talent for parsing spoken languages. After spending 1 minute listening to a speaker use a language it doesn't already know, a mezlan can understand that language. After listening for 1 additional minute, the mezlan can speak the language. This understanding lasts for 24 hours before fading from the mezlan's mutable mind. To understand the same language again after this time, the mezlan must spend another minute listening to a creature speak that language. The mezlan doesn't have to be engaged in a conversation to use this ability.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Built by Azlanti arcanists and engineers to perform the duties of spies and elite troops, units of mezlans were deployed to engage in extractions, infiltrations, and quick strikes on well-protected locations. Scholars believe that at the height of Azlant, close to 1,500 mezlans were created to save the empire. The difficulty of destroying mezlans leads scholars to believe that at least half of them still exist to this day. Mezlans blur the lines between constructs and oozes, a mixture made even more strange by their possession of unique, previously human personalities. Each mezlan was once an exemplary living Azlanti or Thassilonian soldier graced with superior skills and intelligence. Upon being chosen for this new duty, these soldiers were given a full explanation of the changes they would undergo and signed a contract to serve them empire as mezlans. Each was then subjected to numerous magical and technological procedures to extract her consciousness, preserve it, and inject it into her new form. Sometimes the process didn't take as well as others, and resulted in an incomplete and flawed mezlan. Evidence of these flawed specimens didn't always reveal itself before the creatures were deployed, and many these became rogue mezlans. Most mezlans were recruited from the ranks of the military, and thus most of them possessed martial-related or skill-related class levels; however, a few of these creatures were once wizards who traded their magical talent for an amorphous form and near immortality. Ecology Without the need to eat, sleep, or breathe, mezlans are practically immortal. When they are defeated in battle, they simply discorporate and begin seeping down into the soil or cracks in the ground. If the material making up a mezlan isn't contained in some way or destroyed by subjecting it to continued energy damage, the creature lies dormant for 10 years before reforming. When a mezlan reincorporates, it is treated as if it had 16 negative levels. These negative levels are removed through time at a rate of 1 per month. Mezlans retain a portion of their previous memories and experiences, but the extent of those memories varies from individual to individual. Some mezlans slowly regain their memories, some immediately remember everything from their previous incorporation, and others never fully grasp their previous selves. Habitat &amp; Society Mezlans seem to get along and work well with other mezlans, but to normal, living creatures, they appear strange and unnatural. They are very observant creatures who study everything they encounter, especially creatures-a frequent use of their skill pool ability. Some mezlans become accustomed to a particular form or body and use that persona as a default. Others enjoy keeping dozens of regular personas and cycle through them for particular duties they need to complete, meshing these personalities into a toolkit they use throughout their day-to-day activities. A few purists keep an amorphous, bloblike form unless they need to resemble something else. Strange mezlans who have gone mad over the years constantly shift their forms, flickering between hundreds of different ones. Becoming a Mezlan Though not constructs, mezlans are still created beings, the marriage of transformative magic and a living soul. Only the prohibitive cost of creating mezlans, not any shortage of volunteers, prevented their creators from manufacturing thousands of them. The sheer volume of djezet needed to create a mezlan forced their creators to grant the honor of the transformation to only the best of the best, greatly increasing their worth. The method for creating a mezlan is lost to time, though it is rumored one of them retains the knowledge to produce more of its own kind. In any case, the price of the materials and special processes necessary to create an army of mezlans would likely bankrupt a nation.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Bright Blast (Su) Three times per day, the Red Rider can erupt in flames, damaging all creatures within a 20-foot radius. Those caught in the blast must succeed at a DC 23 Reflex save or take 3d6 points of fire damage and be dazed for 1 round and dazzled for an additional 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based. Rider's Robes (Su) The Red Rider wears robes that provide the same protection as half-plate armor. Rider's Weapon (Su) Whenever the Red Rider successfully confirms a critical hit with his +2 f laming scimitar, the target is dazed for 1 round unless it succeeds at a DC 23 Fortitude save. The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The Red Rider is the most fiery and aggressive of the Three Riders. When Irriseni citizens share old tales of previous Riders around the hearth, stories of the Red Rider's judgments always go into gruesome detail about his wholesale slaughter and shocking violence. Some argue that the Red Rider is no more vicious than the Black Rider, and that the larger number of heinous tales about the Red Rider are simply the result of the time of day in which he engages in his tasks. More citizens are awake and out of their homes during the day to witness the Red Rider's judgments before he cedes his time to the night.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Blinding Light (Su) The White Rider can radiate a 30-foot-radius aura of blinding light as a free action. Creatures within the affected area must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or be permanently blinded. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the Rider's blinding light aura for 24 hours. The save is Constitution-based. Rider's Robes (Su) The White Rider wears robes that provide the same protection as a breastplate.

Once per round, she can draw a +1 brilliant energy arrow from her quiver.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The White Rider is the most even-tempered and diplomatic of the Three Riders. This does not mean that she is sympathetic or merciful, just that there is less blood staining the crisp white garments she wears. When the White Rider comes calling, citizens of Irrisen often seek to curry favor by bringing her gifts of hot tea, pastries, and fresh baked bread. She rarely accepts these offerings, and when she does it is only from those she has already judged to be loyal to Baba Yaga and worthy of the Queen of Witches's rule. Those who too eagerly attempt to carry favor face added scrutiny from her.</Description>

However, despite this dramatic change in climate, a few particularly strong and hardy specimens managed to survive, and over the centuries the magical forces holding this realm in its grip have aided the evolution of species better suited to this harsh environment.</Description_Visual>

    <SpecialAbilities>Trackless Step (Ex) A boreal annis hag does not leave a trail in snow and cannot be tracked. She can choose to leave a trail if she so desires.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Though boreal creatures mostly resemble their temperate kin, the effects of sorcerous winter have bolstered them, making them stronger and much more dangerous. In basic shape and form they appear similar to their ancestors, but other characteristics reveal the creatures' altered nature. Their fur and skin are much paler, often shades of blue, gray, or simply white, and it is not uncommon for parts of these creatures to be cloaked in frost, especially their jagged claws and shaggy hair. Creating a Boreal Creature "Boreal" is an inherited template that can be added to any Huge or smaller corporeal creature. This template cannot be applied to a creature with the fire subtype. Challenge Rating: Same as the base creature +1. Type: The creature gains the cold subtype. If applied to a creature with the animal or vermin type, the creature's type changes to magical beast. Do not recalculate its Hit Dice, base attack bonus, saves, or skill points. Attacks: A boreal creature's natural attacks deal an additional 1d6 points of cold damage. Abilities: Str +2, Con +2. Skills: The creature receives a +4 bonus on Stealth and Survival checks in snow. An aquatic boreal creature receives a +4 racial bonus on Stealth and Survival checks at all times in frigid waters (its natural habit), instead of in snow. Environment: The creature's natural environment changes to a cold climate. Special Qualities: A boreal creature gains the following special quality. Trackless Step (Ex): A boreal creature does not leave a trail in snow and cannot be tracked. It can choose to leave a trail, if it so desires. This special quality does not apply to aquatic boreal creatures.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Doll's Dagger (Su) The dagger wielded by a guardian doll is treated as a masterwork weapon and delivers 1d6 points of cold damage in addition to its normal damage. Those struck by the dagger must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or be paralyzed by the supernatural cold of the weapon for 1d4 rounds. If the guardian doll is destroyed, its weapon becomes a useless child's toy. The save DC is Charisma-based. Soul Focus (Su) The soul bound to the doll lives within a focus integrated into the doll or its apparel, typically one of the doll's eyes or a gem embedded into its neck or chest. As long as this soul focus remains intact, it can be used to animate another doll, using the same cost as creating a new construct. Once bound into the soul focus, the soul continues to learn. If it is put into a new doll body, the soul retains its personality and memories from its previous bodies. A soul focus has hardness 8, 12 hit points, and a break DC of 20. Susceptible to Mind-Affecting Effects (Ex) Like a soulbound doll, a guardian doll is susceptible to mind-affecting effects. However, due to the singular purpose with which it is imbued, its saves against such effects are made with a +1 racial bonus.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Guardian dolls are constructs created by the White Witches to serve as spies and sentries at places that require ever-vigilant wardens-especially the wintry nation's borders. Similar to soulbound dolls (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 255), these strange automatons are infused with fragments of the souls of living beings slain during the dolls' creation. The doll is sentient, and though a small part of the soul's original personality remains, the witchery employed largely strips it of its individuality. Many guardian dolls sit inside another form of construct-a sentinel hut- and stand vigil at one of Irrisen's borders and monitoring those who would enter. Others are sent on scouting missions or to spy on targets, usually posing as inanimate dolls to hide their true nature. Construction A guardian doll's body is made of porcelain or wood, plus one exquisite item worth at least 600 gp to serve as the soul focus. Creation requires a soul fragment from a dead creature that dies at some point during the creation of the doll. An unwilling soul can resist with a successful DC 20 Will save. Stripping a soul fragment from a dead creature does not prevent the rest of the soul from continuing to the afterlife, nor does it prevent the body from being resurrected or raised from the dead. Guardian Doll CL 8th; Price 6,600 gp CONSTRUCTION Requirements Craft Construct, false life, lesser geas, magic jar, minor creation, sleet storm, soul of a living creature who dies or is slain during the creation process, creator must be caster level 8th; Skill Craft (sculpture) DC 16; Cost 3,600 gp</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Breath Weapon (Su) Every 1d4 rounds, the khala can fire a jet of frigid liquid up to 60 feet in a straight line from one of its three mouths, dealing 16d6 points of cold damage to the target (Reflex DC 27 half). Even if this save is successful, the target must succeed at a second save (Fortitude DC 27) or be encased in ice. A trapped creature must succeed at a DC 25 Strength check or a DC 26 Escape Artist check to break free. Attempting to break free of the ice is a full-round action. Disease (Su) A target bitten by a khala must succeed at a DC 27 Fortitude save or contract chillbane fever. Chillbane Fever: disease-injury; save Fort DC 17; onset 1 day; frequency 1/day; effect 1d4 Con damage and target is sickened and fatigued; cure 2 consecutive saves. Tenacious Grapple (Ex) A khala does not gain the grappled condition if it grapples a foe with its tail.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>It is rumored that the khala was a rare breed of amphibious dragon before Baba Yaga came to Golarion. Her arrival and the supernatural winter that came with her warped these once-proud creatures into voracious, wicked things that delight in the suffering of others. Each of a khala's three heads can strike at a separate target, though if two or more heads hit a single target, they cause horrific wounds as they viciously fight to devour chunks of its flesh. Along with suffering terrible injuries, those bitten by a khala risk contracting chillbane fever, a disease unique to Irrisen. The creature can ambulate like a snake, slithering along the ground or through the boughs of trees with its batlike wings drawn close to its body, but it prefers flight whenever possible. The khala's breath weapon, usable by a single head every 1d4 rounds, is a jet of freezing liquid that freezes on contact, trapping the target in ice. All khala are female, and scholars debate how the creature procreates. Some believe that the males of the species, known in legend as the zmey, were wiped out in a war with the khala prior to Baba Yaga's arrival.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Dancing Evasion (Ex) The sentinel hut's dancing and hopping movements give it a +3 bonus on all Reflex saves. Immune to Magic (Ex) Sentinel huts are immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance, with the exception of spells with the fire descriptor, which affect it normally. Stir Crazy (Su) A victim swallowed whole by a sentinel hut is trapped in a plain, 10-foot-square room. A trapped creature is not considered grappled, and can move freely about the room. Every round, it is bombarded with a powerful psychic force that causes 1d2 points of Wisdom damage. To escape, the victim must deal damage on the sentinel hut's door (AC 15, 12 hp). Damage dealt to any part of the interior other than the door still adds to the damage dealt to the construct overall, but won't free the victim. If sufficient damage is dealt to the hut to destroy it (from without or within), the trapped creature is freed, but must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or be afflicted by insanity (Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide 250). Victims who break through the door from within are not subject to this latter effect.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Though few have seen Baba Yaga's Dancing Hut and lived to tell the tale, many scholars believe that these bizarre constructs, created by the White Witches of Irrisen, were modeled after their mother's miraculous artifact. Used primarily as sentinels on Irrisen's borders, these quaint hovels on stilt-like legs surprise passersby when they move in an almost comical dancing strut. Construction A sentinel hut must be made of the wood from a tree grown in Irrisen's eternal winter (an extraordinarily rare commodity) and thatch for the roof. Both wood and thatch must be treated with magical ointments and powders worth 1,000 gp.

    <SpecialAbilities>Gale Breath (Su) Every 1d4 rounds as a full-round action, a ved can draw in a mighty breath and expel it outward in a 30-foot cone. Targets within 10 feet of the origin of this cone must succeed at a DC 18 Strength check or be knocked prone. Those who succeed at the check or are standing farther away from the ved treat the effects of the gale breath as a gust of wind spell.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>When Baba Yaga invaded the eastern Linnorm Kingdoms, she brought these ungainly giants with her and left them here to fend for themselves once they had helped her conquer Irrisen. Brutish and rather stupid, these humanoids are clannish and shun even lightly populated areas, preferring the cold hills and mountains of southern Irrisen. Occasionally a gang of veds (often an adult leading two or three adolescents) carries out raids against the mining camps in that region, claiming the lives of half a dozen miners or slaves. But such forced labor is easily replaced, and the Jadwiga overseeing operations in the region don't view these depredations as a serious threat to their extraction industry. Clans of veds rarely consist of more than a few mated pairs, their offspring, and one or two aged specimens that are commonly left to die when they become unable to pull their weight. Veds are omnivores; they prefer meat (eaten raw), but aren't averse to consuming winteryew bark for nourishment. Perhaps the most unusual aspect of veds is their enormous lung capacity, which they are able to use quite aggressively. These giants can expel air from their lungs in a mighty blast, extinguishing small fires and knocking prone any who stand before them. The veds then descend on their victims, pummeling their prey viciously with simple but effective clubs.</Description>

    <Description>Polar bears swim along frigid coasts and wander icy plains looking for prey. They often eat seals plucked from holes in the ice, but will attack any creature when desperate or provoked. Unlike most animals, polar bears show little fear, and can be dangerous scavengers around arctic settlements. They can easily avoid conf lict by plunging into the icy waters, which they often do instead of engaging every threat. A polar bear's blubber gives it buoyancy, and its long neck keeps its head above water. Oversized paws with webbed toes propel it along steadily, and a polar bear can swim over 100 miles in a single day. Some arctic clans hunt polar bears as a significant source of food, and use the furs and bones for clothes and vital tools. Many of these cultures hold the bears sacred, and honor their deaths with rituals and ceremonies. Polar bears live, on average, 15-20 years, but arctic peoples have known individual bears that lived as long as 40 years. One of the largest animal predators to stalk the ice, an adult male polar bear can weigh 800 to 1,200 pounds, with females weighing 350 to 650 pounds.</Description>

    <Description>The weasel family includes a long list of common mammals such as ferrets, minks, ermines, polecats, and stoats. All of them, on rare occasions, produce giant varieties. Opportunistic carnivores, weasels prefer their food live, or at least fresh. To maintain their high metabolism they must consume close to 40% of their body weight per day, so giant weasels hunt a wide variety of creatures. Though generally fearful of sentient creatures, giant weasels aggressively protect their territory. Weasels fight by attaching themselves to their foes with their sharp incisors and then ripping open their victims' flesh with teeth and claws. Using this tactic, giant weasels can take down large animals, such as elk and moose, and attack other predators if they can take them by surprise. Weasels can be found in almost any climate, from jungles to the arctic. Exceptional climbers, they are equally at ease moving overland or scrambling up rocky cliffs, and can even swim if necessary. Giant weasels make their homes in abandoned dens and burrows, and often bring back fur from their prey to line nests. Most weasels mate in the spring and give birth to litters of four to 10 young in the early summer. Giant weasels' coats range from red to brown and sometimes gray; their underbellies are usually a lighter color, often white. They also exhibit a wide variety of markings ranging from stripes to masks, and some molt during the winter, producing a pure white coat. The proportion of the head and jaw varies among various subspecies. During mating season and when frightened, weasels release a pungent musk. Though it's offensive to most creatures, it's not debilitating like a skunk's musk. In folk tales and among hunters and trappers, weasels have a reputation for being exceptionally clever. Elders warn of giant weasels making off with human children, just as small weasels steal the eggs of birds. Giant weasels grow to up to 9 feet in length from nose to the base of their tails, which can grow to almost the length of their bodies. They weigh upward of 300 pounds.

    <Description>Timber wolves range in color from white to gray to pitch black. The largest males can weigh 175 pounds. Timber wolves typically have longer legs and bigger paws to help traverse the difficult terrain in which they live. More importantly, their proportionally larger heads, held up by powerful neck muscles, allow them to drag down sizable herd animals. Hunts begin with a communal howl to unite the pack. They chase their prey over vast distances-sometimes over 50 miles-wearing prey down with fear and exhaustion. Using jaws capable of crushing bones and snapping spines, several timber wolves at a time might latch on to a victim and drag it to the ground. Their speed and pack instincts let them use coordinated attacks, flanking, and hit-and-run maneuvers. Group howling helps bind the pack together. The howls can be used for calling the pack to the hunt, determining the location of other pack members, communicating food sources, and even determining social order. Howls can be heard over vast distances and help establish a pack's territory, which averages 350 square miles. The power and majesty of timber wolves inspire many sentient races. For civilized folk, the wolf has come to embody a primitive evil, often playing the role of a villain in fairy tales. This has earned the animal an undeserved reputation for aggression. Among northern peoples, the wolf symbolizes strength and prowess in battle. Many tribes revere wolf totems, and some even claim in their folklore to be originally descended from wolves.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Sticky Resin (Ex) A frost fir's bark constantly exudes a sticky resin that aids its combat maneuvers and natural attacks. The resin grants a frost fir a +2 circumstance bonus on all disarm, grapple, and steal combat maneuvers, as well as on saving throws against effects that cause it to drop something it is holding. Any creature that is damaged by a frost fir's slam attack, deals damage to a frost fir with a natural weapon or unarmed attack, or otherwise touches a frost fir (including with a grapple maneuver), must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex save or be coated with the frost fir's sticky resin. A creature affected by this resin takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls and concentration checks (penalties from multiple contacts do not stack). Any enemy grappled by a frost fir takes a -2 penalty on attempts to break the grapple and to escape using the Escape Artist skill. Strong alcohol, universal solvent, or any amount of fire damage dealt to a creature coated in resin removes the resin. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Little known outside the colder climes and higher elevations of the world, the malevolent tree creatures known as frost firs keep to themselves and disdain any who intrude upon their forested realms. Prevailing theories among scholars suggest the species descended from treants long ago, a derivative offshoot with an exclusive affinity for evergreen trees. But despite sharing a common language, frost firs actually disdain treants, citing philosophical differences. This revelation has caused others to posit that frost firs originated as an entirely separate species, born of the enigmatic First World where plants walk and speak as freely as other creatures. The grim-minded frost firs are as cold and impassive as the windswept ice and rocks they call home. They care little for other creatures or societies, keeping their distance at all times and actively driving away any who dare to approach their groves during a reproductive cycle. Frost firs also have an especial hatred for those who create or rely upon open flames for warmth. Northern travelers often tell tales of frost fir attacks on their caravans, usually initiated with a smothering, snowy assault on any campfires. These attacks always come at night, and the frost firs never relent until such interlopers completely withdraw from their lands. Frost firs make staunch combatants, specializing in stealthy forms of guerrilla warfare. They often utilize pit traps to capture the unwary, or draw their victims into ambushes facilitated by their ability to appear as normal trees. After grappling and pinning opponents, frost firs often take them prisoner and escort them back to a frost fir grove to be butchered and used to fertilize the soil for frost fir young. Frost firs craft any remaining bones into crude trophies and gruesome signposts marking their territory and warning away others. As a result, few species treat with frost firs, and any act of Diplomacy with them automatically faces a starting attitude of unfriendly. Ecology Frost firs have no individual gender and reproduce asexually, developing both male and female cones that grow along their inner limbs near their thin torsos. The male cones produce pollen for the female cones, which close and gestate for a full year before the seeds are ready to sprout. To facilitate this process, frost firs often stand together on high outcroppings or in windswept passes during an especially reverent period they call Highwind. This allows a maximized sharing of pollen between multiple members of a grove, though a single frost fir can create its own offspring. Indeed, many groves have sprung from a lone frost fir capable of creating as many as six seed cones in a single reproductive cycle. Such progenitors often earn the title of Elder Fir among their own kind, which carries a significant status when representing the grove in external matters (see below). Once a frost fir's fertilized cones fully mature, it clears an area of sacred ground, removing any residual snow or ice so it can plant its seedlings. Groves often band together to share in the responsibility of protecting these offspring, and aggressively defend such plots from intruders. Frost fir seedlings grow much like sprouting evergreen trees for their first two years, incapable of moving and sustained primarily by nourishment derived from the soil and sun. Caretakers of these seedlings refer to this time as the Loaming, and they often place carrion or other organic detritus around the grove to better fertilize the frigid soil and encourage more rapid growth. Some even hunt living creatures to ensure a supply of carcasses for this effort. Following 2 years of sustained growth, a young frost fir finally becomes ambulatory enough to join the rest of the grove as a contributing member. Its lifespan extends about 50 years thereafter, and it can bear offspring for only about half that time. Occasionally, a frost fir's development remains stunted during the Loaming process and it fails to uproot itself. Such a child continues to grow as a regular evergreen tree, but never gains sentience. The frost firs often revisit sites where these trees grow to mourn their loss. Habitat &amp; Society Frost firs form communal groves of no more than 12 members at a time, banding together until their numbers grow large enough for a group to separate and establish a new grove. They always make their homes in colder climes where other creatures are less plentiful, choosing the most inhospitable conditions in an effort to further deter intruders. Most frost firs prefer to keep their groves small to attract less attention, and purposefully separate into multiple groves to maximize the survival chances of their species. Only in times of great conf lict do multiple groves join forces. Such gatherings have given rise to legends of entire forests disappearing or growing up from an empty field overnight-usually followed by great devastation visited upon whatever stirred up the frost firs' ire. Within frost fir society, Elder Firs carry a high degree of respect between groves, serving as representatives not only among their own kind, but also to the outside world. They coordinate reproductive cycles with other frost firs to replenish any losses a grove endures, and guide the decision-making regarding the establishment of new groves. Sometimes they grow larger than the other members of the grove, gaining the giant template while taking class levels in druid. Such leaders always select the Plant domain for their nature bond. Elder Firs who obtain the thousand faces class ability use the guises of Medium humanoids to spy upon and interact with nearby settlements to ensure no one encroaches on their lands.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Telekinesis (Su) A domovoi defends itself and its home through telekinesis. This ability functions as the spell telekinesis, usable at will, with a caster level equal to the domovoi's Hit Dice (CL 5 for most domovoi). A typical domovoi has a ranged attack roll of +5 when using telekinesis to hurl objects or creatures, and can use the ability on objects weighing up to 50 pounds. If a domovoi attempts to hurl a creature with this ability, that creature can resist the effect with a successful DC 14 Will save. The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The work never ends for those who live on farms or in small villages, and the wise often seek the aid of the fey-folk while pursuing their daily chores. A family might leave a piece of bread under the stove or an old boot in the closet to attract a domovoi to their home. Domovoi help with small tasks like churning butter and mending clothes, but mostly protect the home from intruders and misfortune. A domovoi appears as small, old man no more than 2 feet high, covered in hair and with a long, shaggy beard. These helpful fey can also tell the fate of the family they protect, but grow annoyed when asked to do so too often.</Description>

    <Description>Just as the domovoi protect the home, the dvorovoi protect a villager's yard and pasture. Some farmers try to lure dvorovoi to their farmsteads by leaving an offering of bread, sheep's wool, or shiny trinkets. When the owner of a farmstead with a dvorovoi purchases a new animal, he leads it through the yard to introduce it to the dvorovoi, hoping to gain the fey creature's approval of the new livestock. Though undeniably useful to have around for feeding the cattle and keeping predators away from flocks, dvorovoi can be capricious. Dvorovoi despise any white animal, and will never tolerate a white-furred horse or cow in their presence. For unknown reasons, dvorovoi doesn't hold this same grudge toward white chickens.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Luck Touch (Su) With a claw attack or touch attack, an ovinnik can alter a creature's luck. If the target fails a DC 14 Will save, it either gains a +4 bonus or takes a -4 penalty (ovinnik's choice) on its next three d20 rolls. The target can choose to automatically fail the saving throw, but must choose before it knows whether the touch will be beneficial or harmful. The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Ovinniks make their homes in granaries and drying houses. These thin, sleek, black-furred humanoids stand only a foot high. Their eyes and features seem catlike, but they bark like dogs to scare away thieves. No one knows why an ovinnik chooses to take up residence in a particular farm's threshing house, and few would call on them willingly. A wise farmer placates resident ovinniks with frequent gifts of warm milk, pancakes, or dead roosters. By tradition, before the new year farmers and their families go to the granary to learn their fates for the coming year. The ovinnik touches each of them in turn. If the touch is warm, the person will have good luck; if cold, she will suffer terrible misfortune in the days ahead.</Description>

    <Description>The dreaded witchcrow, renowned as a harbinger of ill deeds and misfortune, preys on the weak and spies on the unwary. Clever, manipulative, and avaricious in the extreme, these foul birds have no conscience and know no fear. Witchcrows strive to steal not only victims' most cherished possessions, but their hopes and dreams as well. They delight in bringing anguish, sowing doubt even as they feign friendly advice designed to tear down alliances, dupe the gullible, and compromise the virtuous. Despite their deceptive nature, witchcrows can also hold valuable information-or come by such if paid to retrieve it. Witchcrows value arcane magic above all else, not simply as practitioners-the birds certainly have their own innate talent for witchcraft-but also as collectors. In exchange for their services or valuable information, witchcrows trade for scrolls, potions, and other lesser magic items. Even if such items go unoffered, an intense covetous streak drives witchcrows to pilfer these things if they sense them among a bargainer's possessions. Often, they single out arcane casters as targets for thievery, closing on casters from a distance with their vanish ability and executing flyby attacks to snatch away any baubles they desire. They carry such loot back to their nests to proudly share stories of their daring raids under the preening adulation of their peers. Prolonged spellcasting (casting spells with a casting time greater than 1 round) often attracts witchcrows in the area. They stalk spellcasters in groups, watching for opportunities to steal from them. Ecology Legends claim the first witchcrows spawned in the Dimension of Dreams-hatched from corrupted eggs nurtured by night hags and released onto other planes to carry out misdeeds. Whether this tale is true or not, these birds often keep company with hags. They sometimes treat with more powerful magical beings as messengers, spies, or informants, traveling in groups for mutual protection. Each covey or murder also follows a migratory pattern, moving between sites of power and areas of unusual magic. Greater witchcrows not only hoard arcane items, but also are dependent on them for reproduction, siphoning away subtle emanations of magical power to aid their gestation process. The likelihood of an egg hatching into a greater witchcrow increases in direct correlation to the time it spends in close proximity to such items. As a result, female witchcrows are much more active in stealing arcane objects for their nests and aggressively fend off rivals to retain any treasure in their possession. Witchcrows can lay a clutch of up to five eggs every year and remain fertile throughout their entire adult lifespan-approximately 20 to 30 years. As a greater witchcrow nears the end of its life, it experiences an unusual phenomenon called the Dreaming, in which it enters a fugue state lasting nearly a week. During this time, it molts and meditates as it comes to terms with the end of its life and attempts to pinpoint its final resting place. Usually, this is a place it particularly enjoyed in the past. Once the bird determines the location and fixates on it, the remaining members of its group invoke their apportation to send it there as its life's reward. Thereafter, the others argue and bicker over any magic items left behind by the elder witchcrow. Habitat &amp; Society Witchcrows have an affinity for colder climes, and often masquerade as normal crows living in the fields and forests near the civilized settlements of other creatures. They particularly seek out magical societies where they can gain greater access to arcane items. On Golarion, this makes witchcrows most prevalent in Irrisen, where they've developed a terrible reputation-enough so that the witches of Irrisen (and the people they rule) both fear and revile the birds, marking them for destruction whenever they find them. In witchcrow society, greater witchcrows always establish dominance over their lesser kin, rising to lead large congregations of the malicious birds and shepherding them from one habitat to another. Witchcrows always mutually support one another even as they compete for the same resources, following a strict social hierarchy that aggrandizes the most successful thieves among them. Leaders of any given covey collect and dispense the spoils of their activities, assigning arcane treasures to the strongest of their kind during mating season. Those witchcrows that contribute little to the group's success often find themselves with empty nests during these gatherings-or cast out of the flock entirely.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Apportation (Su) In large enough groupings (such as a murder), greater witchcrows can perform a cooperative form of magic once per day to open a glowing ring in one place leading to somewhere else on the planet. This always entails a raucous aerial ritual, usually centered on those that wish to make use of this ability. The ritual functions like a teleportation circle (CL 17th), except it requires 1 minute of uninterrupted casting time, the circle doesn't need to be placed on a horizontal surface, and it is not invisible or hard to detect. After coming into existence, the edges of the circle glow and the effect stays in place for 1 minute. Most witchcrows loathe using this power, but some offer it as a service to those in need of quick travel, demanding a high price for such assistance-usually something in the bargainer's possession that is cherished, extremely valuable, and almost always magical. Hexes (Su) A greater witchcrow uses hexes as a 5th-level witch. Invariably, these abilities include the cackle, evil eye, and misfortune hexes, and require a successful DC 15 Will save to negate or resist. Witchcrow cackling proves especially unnerving as it sounds like extremely mocking cawing.</SpecialAbilities>

    <Description>Pandas spend most of their lives alone, avoiding even other pandas except during mating season. They are excellent climbers, with front paws configured much like humans' opposable thumbs to help them grip bamboo stalks and tree branches. Bamboo shoots make up almost their entire diet, although pandas are technically omnivorous. In part because of the low nutritional value of bamboo, pandas lack the energy for aggression, and avoid danger wherever possible.

    <SpecialAbilities>Natural Diver (Ex) Armadillos can hold their breath underwater for up to 6 minutes. Their dense armor naturally causes them to sink; they can inflate their stomachs to counter this, accounting for their racial bonus on Swim checks. Protective Ball (Ex) Some armadillos can roll up into a ball, increasing their natural armor bonus to +3 but decreasing their speed to 0.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>These squat-bodied mammals are easily recognizable thanks to their distinctive leathery shell, which provides them with natural protection against numerous dangers and predators in their native environs. Armadillos have very poor eyesight, perceiving the world largely through scent and touch. They are exceptional diggers, and burrow both to find food and to make their dens. When an armadillo goes underwater, it swallows air to increase its buoyancy, inflating its stomach up to twice its normal size so it won't sink. These stats represent an average armadillo, which is 2-1/2 feet long and weighs roughly 10 pounds, but other breeds can range from 6 inches to up to 5 feet long, and weigh up to 130 pounds in the case of giant armadillos.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Electrolocation (Ex) While underwater, platypuses can sense the tiny electrical currents that trigger muscle movement. This allows them to locate living prey and to distinguish it from inanimate objects. Treat electrolocation as blindsight 30 feet, but platypuses can sense only living creatures, and it functions only underwater. Poison (Ex) Spur-injury; save Fort DC 9; frequency 1/round for 4 rounds; effect 1 nonlethal damage; cure 1 save. Semiaquatic (Ex) Platypuses can hold their breath underwater for up to 5 minutes before they must start attempting Constitution checks to avoid suffocation.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Platypuses are members of an extremely unusual order of egg-laying mammals known as monotremes, and live in riverside burrows where they hunt for worms, larvae, and shellfish. Platypuses also possess a remarkable electrical sense they use in place of sight, scent, and hearing while hunting underwater. The average platypus is roughly 1-1/2 feet long and weighs 3-1/2 pounds.</Description>

    <Description>Rabbits are burrowing herbivores with short tails, long ears for sensing predators, and powerful hind legs that allow them to leap quickly to safety in an emergency. They are frequently confused with rodents, but can be distinguished thanks to their two sets of incisor teeth, which are positioned one behind the other. An average rabbit is between 8 and 20 inches long and weighs 1 to 4 pounds.</Description>

    <Description>Squirrels are surprisingly wily creatures. When they know they are being watched, they pretend to bury nuts, but instead sneak them into their mouths and take them away to hide elsewhere when no one is watching.

    <Description_Visual>This creature is made of hundreds of metal masks, welded together to form a roughly humanoid body. The masks are mostly iron, but some-such as the hands, knees, and feet- are made of silver lined with gold.

    <IsTemplate>0</IsTemplate>
    <SpecialAbilities>Immunity to Magic (Ex) A mask golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below. • A shatter spell deals 4d6 points of damage (no save). • A grease spell prevents the mask golem from using its masks of control ability for the duration of the spell (no save). Masks that are already in place are unaffected. • A make whole spell heals the golem as normal and automatically restores one of its masks of control if any have been destroyed. • Any magical attack against a mask golem that deals sonic damage affects the mask golem normally. Masks of Control (Su): As a standard action, a mask golem can force one of its masks onto a humanoid opponent's face. This ability has a range of 30 feet. Attaching a mask in this way requires a successful combat maneuver check and does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Once in place, the mask has one of two effects. Obedience: The target must make a DC 13 Will save each round or fall under the mask golem's control for 1 round. This functions as dominate person. The save DC is Charisma-based. Solitude: The target cannot speak, breathe, or hear while the mask is in place. The mask can be removed with a successful combat maneuver check against the mask golem's CMD. The mask can also be destroyed, but half of any damage dealt is made to the target instead of the mask. The mask has Hardness 5 and 5 hit points. A mask golem has a number of masks equal to its Hit Dice (usually 4). If removed from a victim, the mask returns to the golem immediately and can be used again. Destroyed masks are replenished at the rate of 1 per day. Swarm Form (Ex): Once per day as a standard action, a mask golem can assume the form of a swarm of masks. While in this form, it gains the swarm subtype, a fly speed of 60 feet (average), a swarm attack that deals 1d6 points of damage, and the distraction quality (DC 12). Anyone whotakes damage from the swarm attack can also be attacked with one of the golem's masks of control as a free action (assuming the golem has enough masks available). The swarm is made up of Tiny creatures, but does not gain any additional damage reduction. A mask golem can maintain this form for a number of minutes equal to its Hit Dice. Any damage dealt to the swarm is subtracted from the golem's hit points, as normal.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Made up of hundreds of masks, a mask golem is a construct forged by the faithful of Razmir to honor the Living God. These constructs are often placed in their temples or other locations that they wish to protect, such as treasure vaults or private sanctuaries for powerful priests. They spend much of their time completely immobile, only coming to life when their instructions force them to take action. Many acolytes are unaware of their true nature, having spent years viewing them as simple statues. Mask golems can understand Common, but they cannot speak. While they possess intelligence, they are bound by the orders of their creators and are seldom given free reign when assigned to a task. Rarely, these golems are employed as assassins, sent out to punish or kill those that threaten the church. While all of the masks that make up the golem's body are copies of the holy symbol of Razmir, they are made of different materials. Most are simple iron, but the masks around the joints are made of silver with gold trim, and the head is made from a specially crafted porcelain mask, set with a sapphire. When a mask golem is destroyed, these valuable masks remain, and are worth 1,000 gp in total. The sapphire is worth 500 gp. A mask golem stands 5 feet tall and weighs 300 pounds. Construction A mask golem's body is made from hundreds of iron masks, as well as a few that are plated in silver and trimmed with gold, worth a total of 2,000 gp. In addition, the crafter must place a sapphire worth 500 gp into the golem's forehead to complete its creation. Mask Golem CL 9th; Price 22,500 gp Constr uctio n Requirements Craft Construct, dominate person, see invisibility, telekinesis, creator must be caster level 9th; Skill Craft (sculptures) DC 16; Cost 12,500 gp</Description>
    <DuringCombat>A mask golem attempts to control any powerful melee combatant that moves to threaten it using its mask of obedience ability. Against ranged opponents, it uses its mask of solitude. If these do not work, it relies on its slam attacks instead.</DuringCombat>
    <Morale>A mask golem fights to defend the area it has been built to protect, even if this results in its destruction.</Morale>

    <SpecialAbilities>Blood Drain (Ex) If a spawn of Yog-Sothoth establishes or maintains a pin with a tentacle, it drains blood via tiny slavering mouths that open along the tentacle's length, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage. Devastation (Ex) As a full-round action, the spawn can assault a structure, dealing 4d6+16 points of damage to the structure in that round. Natural Invisibility (Ex) This ability is constant-a spawn is invisible at all times, even when attacking. This ability is subject to effects like invisibility purge, glitterdust, and faerie fire, but cannot be dispelled.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Although the spawn of Yog-Sothoth are naturally invisible, they exude a hideous and unforgettable stench. They are begotten upon the world as the results of vile rituals in which cultists call down the essence of Yog-Sothoth from beyond the stars to impregnate a humanoid creature, for the Outer God is not of this dimension or world; only by incorporating flesh and bone of a mortal can its spawn exist. Upon death, a spawn's flesh rapidly melts until nothing but a crusty stain remains. Ancient legend holds that the spawn of Yog-Sothoth are inflicted upon a world to clear it of all sane life and to prepare the way for the return of the Great Old Ones to their former dominion. Yet a spawn's ravenous and constant thirst for blood may be just as responsible for driving it to heights of mayhem and destruction that mark its presence in a region. A spawn of Yog-Sothoth grows quickly to the size presented here, but if it continues to feed, it also continues to grow, albeit at a lesser rate. A truly ancient spawn of Yog-Sothoth can be the size of a barn or even a small hill. Not all spawn of Yog-Sothoth are as massive or inhuman as the one presented here. Some (often twins to their more monstrous kin) remain roughly humanoid in shape and size, although their deformities are so great that they must wear disguises or several layers of baggy clothing in order to walk unchallenged in civilized regions. These sinister creatures have a wide range of strange and unusual abilities and appearances.</Description>

    <Description_Visual>A veiny, swollen bulb that bears a disturbing resemblance to an oversized brain squats atop five ropy legs, haphazardly encrusted with fungal shelves and bearing folds that resemble gills. A wide orifice with chitinous, teeth-like ridges gapes at the top of the creature, fringed with waving filaments and two long tendrils that lash the air. Its form seems overlaid with a confusing welter of rapidly changing, flickering images, making it difficult to see clearly.</Description_Visual>

    <SpecialAbilities>Otherworldly Mind (Ex) Any creature attempting to contact a cerebric fungus's mind or read its thoughts with a divination spell or similar ability must make a DC 16 Will save or be overwhelmed by the alien thoughts in the creature's head. Those who fail take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage, are confused for 1d6 rounds, and their spell immediately ends. The save is Charisma-based and includes a +2 racial bonus. Star-Shriek (Ex) When distressed, a cerebric fungus can unleash a shrill scream of madness and despair that echoes the cold, dark void between the stars. All creatures (except other cerebric fungi) within 30 feet must make a DC 15 Will save or be nauseated for 1d4 rounds. This ability can be used once per day as a full-round action. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Constitution-based. Touch of Madness (Sp) The caster may daze one living creature by making a successful touch attack. If the target creature does not make a successful DC 14 Will save, its mind is clouded and it takes no action for 1 round per caster level. The dazed subject is not stunned (so attackers get no special advantage against it). This is a mind-affecting enchantment, equivalent to a 2ndlevel spell. Unsettling Appearance (Su) A cerebric fungus constantly scans the minds of those around it, projecting around itself a confusing collage of images gleaned from their thoughts. Creatures within 60 feet that can see the fungus must succeed on a DC 14 Will save or take a -2 penalty on attack rolls while looking at the fungus. This is a mind-affecting phantasm. The save is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Cerebric fungi are a race of carnivorous, intelligent fungi native to the distant planet Aucturn. Although they are one of the lowest life forms on that world, the fungi still possess an alien intellect far beyond that of most terrestrial creatures. Cerebric fungi rarely leave their native planet, but display great curiosity about other races and species when they visit other worlds, asking endless, apparently senseless, questions and engaging in disturbing experiments. Cerebric fungi cannot speak, but they can telepathically communicate with any intelligent creature, as well as inf luence them with their mental powers. However, their extraterrestrial minds are so alien that communication can be extremely diff icult. Those few mages or scientists that have managed to contact the fungi claim to have been granted great wisdom and knowledge of the Dark Tapestry between the stars through the sibilant mental whispers of the fungi, but only at the cost of their sanity. Although capable of fine manipulation with their prehensile filaments, cerebric fungi normally forgo the use of weapons in favor of their natural attacks. They apparently feed on organic life in some way, though virtually nothing is known of their Ecology or society, if they even have one.</Description>

    <Description_Visual>Long, velvety green tendrils extend from a massive green trunk. A knot of roots stands exposed, branching out from the base, raising the immense plant off the ground. Giant clusters of blossoms and pulsing nodules sprout from the plant, occasionally shedding a dim, repulsive glow. It's enough, almost, to distract from the writhing tendrils and the giant, oddly toothed clamshell leaves that betray a life no plant should have.</Description_Visual>

    <SpecialAbilities>Light Pulse (Su) As a standard action, a moonflower can release a pulse of bright light from its numerous blossoms every 1d6 rounds up to 3 times a day. All sighted creatures within 50 feet (save other moonflowers) with line of sight to the moonflower must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. This save is Constitution-based. Pod Prison (Ex) Once every 1d4 rounds, a moonflower can try to swallow a grabbed opponent of a size smaller than itself by making a successful combat maneuver check. A swallowed creature is swiftly cocooned in a tight, fibrous mass and forced out of the moonflower's space into an adjacent square of the plant's choice. Once expelled, the creature remains cocooned and takes 2d8+8 points of bludgeoning damage and 8 points of acid damage per round from the living cocoon's pulsing, acid-filled innards. A cocooned creature can cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal 25 points of damage to the cocoon's insides (AC 15). Others can aid a cocooned creature by attacking with slashing or piercing weapons, but in addition to the damage dealt to the cocoon, the creature inside takes half the damage of an attack. Once the creature exits, the cocoon deflates and is destroyed. Other swallowed opponents are cocooned in their own pods. Pod Spawn (Ex) Should a moonflower's pod prison be allowed to kill and digest a Small or larger creature, 1d4 hours later it transforms into an adult moonflower with full hit points. The newly formed moonflower has its own consciousness, but some aspect of its trunk or blossoms resembles the creature that died within. The dead creature's equipment remains inside the new moonflower and can only be retrieved by killing the alien plant.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>A fully-grown moonflower stands easily 20 feet tall with a massive trunk that is frequently 4 feet or more in diameter. The roots extend away from the base and into the soil, making the plant seem well anchored, but the roots themselves possess an agility that belies the great size of the plant and allows the moonflower to uproot itself and move with surprising speed. The tendrils of the plant are independently prehensile and writhe around the large flytrap-like "head" that crowns the stem. Bulbous growths and budding protuberances pulse and quiver along the alien plant's trunk and thrum with cosmic light. Moonflowers have never been known to communicate with the natives of Golarion, even druids and others who regularly converse with plants. The plants do possess some manner of strange telepathy, though, being in constant communication with their nearby brethren at all times. Those who manage to intrude upon the creatures' alien thoughts face an assault of horrible visions of terrifying worlds covered by jungles ancient, sentient, and malign.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Blood Drain (Su) A vampire spawn can suck blood from a grappled opponent; if the vampire spawn establishes or maintains a pin, it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution damage. The vampire spawn heals 5 hit points or gains 5 temporary hit points for 1 hour (up to a maximum number of temporary hit points equal to its full normal hit points) each round it drains blood. Dominate (Su) A vampire spawn can crush a humanoid opponent's will as a standard action. Anyone the vampire spawn targets must succeed on a Will save (DC 14) or fall instantly under the vampire spawn's influence, as though by a dominate person spell (caster level 12th). The ability has a range of 30 feet. At the GM's discretion, some vampire spawns might be able to affect different creature types with this power. Energy Drain (Su) A creature hit by a vampire spawn's slam (or other natural weapon) gains one negative level. This ability only triggers once per round, regardless of the number of attacks a vampire spawn makes. Fast Healing (Su)A vampire spawn also gains fast healing 2. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, a vampire spawn assumes gaseous form (see below) and attempts to escape. It must reach its coffin home within 2 hours or be utterly destroyed. (It can normally travel up to 9 miles in 2 hours.) Additional damage dealt to a vampire spawn forced into gaseous form has no effect. Once at rest, the vampire is helpless. It regains 1 hit point after 1 hour, then is no longer helpless and resumes healing at the rate of 2 hit points per round. Gaseous Form (Su) As a standard action, a vampire spawn can assume gaseous form at will (caster level 5th), but it can remain gaseous indefinitely and has a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability. Resurrection Vulnerability (Su) A raise dead or similar spell cast on a vampire spawn destroys it (Will negates). Using the spell in this way does not require a material component. Shadowless (Ex) A vampire spawn casts no shadows and shows no reflection in a mirror. Spider Climb (Ex)A vampire spawn can climb sheer surfaces as though under the effects of a spider climb spell. Weaknesses Vampire spawns cannot tolerate the strong odor of garlic and will not enter an area laced with it. Similarly, they recoil from mirrors or strongly presented holy symbols. These things don't harm the vampire spawn-they merely keep it at bay. A recoiling vampire spawn must stay at least 5 feet away from the mirror or holy symbol and cannot touch or make melee attacks against that creature. Holding a vampire spawn at bay takes a standard action. After 1 round, a vampire spawn can overcome its revulsion of the object and function normally each round it makes a DC 25 Will save.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Vampire spawns cannot enter a private home or dwelling unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. Reducing a vampire spawn's hit points to 0 or lower incapacitates it but doesn't always destroy it (see fast healing). However, certain attacks can slay vampire spawns. Exposing any vampire spawn to direct sunlight staggers it on the first round of exposure and destroys it utterly on the second consecutive round of exposure if it does not escape. Each round of immersion in running water inflicts damage on a vampire spawn equal to one-third of its maximum hit points-a vampire spawn reduced to 0 hit points in this manner is destroyed. Driving a wooden stake through a helpless vampire spawn's heart instantly slays it (this is a full-round action). However, it returns to life if the stake is removed, unless the head is also severed and anointed with holy water.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Bloody Rose (Su) At will as a free action, the herald can create a thorny red rose. She may use this rose as a +1 anarchic dart as if she had the Quick Draw feat. The rose loses all its powers 1 round after it leaves the herald's hand. Darkwood Breastplate The herald's +4 darkwood breastplate has all the normal properties of darkwood but is as hard and strong as steel (similar to wood created with an ironwood spell). Favored Enemy (Ex) The herald has the favored enemy ability of a 17th-level ranger. Imbue with Power (Su) The herald can imbue an ally with a portion of her power. This ability functions like imbue with spell ability, except she may transfer uses of the following spell-like abilities as if they were cleric spells: cure moderate wounds, magic weapon, peasant armaments, protection from arrows, shield other, and status. Using this ability reduces the number of times per day she can use that spell-like ability until she dismisses the transfer or the recipient expends it (for example, if she imbues a target with cure moderate wounds, thereafter she can only use that spell-like ability twice per day). Martyr's Blood (Su) By marking an ally with her blood, the herald can transfer part of her fast healing ability to that ally. The herald's fast healing decreases by 1 (minimum 0), and the ally gains fast healing 1 for 1 hour. This ability has no effect if the target already has fast healing. Rebellious Aura (Su) The herald's aura grants allies within 60 feet the effects of good hope and a paladin's aura of courage. The effects of this ability are included in the herald's stat block. Tactician (Ex) The herald has the tactician ability of a 17th-level cavalier (4/day, one teamwork feat, all allies within 30 feet, 11 rounds).

Once a mortal ranger in the service of Milani, she was an early champion of Galt's Red Revolution when its purpose was to depose evil Chelish nobles, but when that movement become more about chaos and vengeance, she fought against it instead. Eventually branded a Chelish sympathizer by the Revolutionary Council, she allowed herself to be captured in order to allow her allies to escape. She was executed with a final blade, which trapped her soul within it. Milani, having spent a century communicating directly with her followers, saw the merits of having a divine champion like other deities, and plucked the woman's soul from the artifact and made her a herald. Now the martyred hero keeps her original name secret so her living relatives in Galt do not become targets by association, and calls herself Courage Heart. Her mission is twofold: to attack the powerful enemies of the church (especially immortal undead who would subjugate the common folk and conjured outsiders used to strike fear into mortal hearts), and to inspire hope among mortals so they can find the strength to turn against tyrants. As Courage Heart opposes slavery and unjust imprisonment, she has made it her personal crusade to steal all the final blades and free the souls within them. Milani must look at the bigger picture, so the herald has to make progress toward this goal when she can. Courage Heart has been trying to get Pharasma's herald, the Steward of the Skein, to join her cause, as preventing souls from reaching the Boneyard is of interest to the Lady of Graves, but that herald's strange nature and the recent creation of the final blades (relative to the history of civilization) means she has made little headway in establishing that alliance to date. Ecology As she has only been immortal for a few decades, Courage Heart still acts and feels like a mortal woman. She loves her homeland, cares deeply for her mortal relatives (most of whom have some elven blood and were alive when she was murdered), and enjoys worldly delights such as music and stories. Though she has an instinctive knowledge of the people and places near her, she has perfect recall of such things in Galt and feels great sorrow when she discovers that a building or person she knew in life has been destroyed or has died. She collects remnants of Galt's history, such as travel journals about its settlements, songs about its people, and sketches of its locations and inhabitants. Having died for her beliefs holding no expectation of ever returning, Courage Heart considers it an honor to die again and again in her goddess' service, especially if doing so advances the cause or saves mortal lives. The only thing she fears is torture, but she knows her immortal flesh is resistant to punishment and she has magic at her disposal to help her escape almost any confinement. Though she does not need to eat or drink, she still feels the urge to do so, and favors traditional Galtan food. A priest who calls her and has a Galtan meal ready for her is much more likely to get help than one who offers no such courtesy and expects immediate compliance. Habitat &amp; Society Though the herald tries hard to not play favorites, she loves Galt and her extended family, and often checks up on her friends and relatives by lurking in mouse or owl form. Milani's small following and the herald's recent elevation to immortal status means they both are inclined to push the boundaries of what the divine laws allow for direct intervention on Golarion. To bypass these restrictions and watch over her revolution-corrupted homeland, Courage Heart often asks Milani to incarnate her as a mortal ranger (usually of 4th to 7th level) so she can lend a hand where she is needed. In these incarnations she may be male or female and of nearly any human ethnicity or features, but she generally prefers light armor and wields a morningstar. In this mortal shell, she is more careful with her life-not out of any sense of self-preservation, but because she doesn't want her death to upset anyone she befriends. She prefers to show up in a settlement, deal with a problem, then leave before there are too many questions. Among the other celestial servitors of Milani, Courage Heart is beloved as a comrade and leader. She often gathers teams of like-minded celestials to ambush and slay devils, undead, and minions of Zon- Kuthon, then retires with these comrades to Milani's realm in Elysium to tell stories of each other's bravery and virtue.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Dissonance (Su) Every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a dawn piper can use a musical instrument to unleash a deadly torrent of sonic vibrations that tears at the very physicality of its enemies. This is similar to a breath weapon that deals 6d6 points of sonic damage in a 15-ft. cone (Reflex DC 16 half ). A dawn piper must be in possession of a musical instrument in order to use this ability. The save DC is Charisma-based. Elemental Font (Su) A dawn piper can infuse a 40-foot-radius area with the primal qualities of the First World. The creation of an elemental font requires a musical instrument and a musical ritual lasting 8 hours. As long as the piper returns to it every 24 hours, a font can persist forever, but it is destroyed immediately upon the creator's death. A dawn piper can also destroy its own font as a full-round action. The dawn piper gains additional spell-like abilities based on a single element while within range of its elemental font. Dimensional anchor and dimensional lock stop the flow of power, preventing the piper from using the additional spell-like abilities. The save DCs are Charisma-based, and the spell-like abilities are cast at caster level 7th.

Non-fey creatures within a 30-foot radius of the dawn piper must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be blinded or deafened for 1d4 rounds (the piper's choice, but the effect is consistent for all affected creatures), and take 1 point of bleed damage from their eyes or ears (depending on the specific effect). This aura lasts 1 full round, and a creature that succeeds at its saving throw cannot be affected again for 24 hours. This is a visual or auditory, mind-affecting effect. A dawn piper requires a musical instrument in order to create this aura. The save DC for this ability is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Strange and enigmatic creatures from the First World, dawn pipers are unmistakably humanoid and share some of the same delicate features of half-elves. But dawn pipers' otherworldly nature becomes evident when one looks at the creatures' eyes, which burn with a strange light. Their skin is smooth, free of blemish or body hair, and radiant. Their hair moves constantly, like the flickering flames of a torch in the breeze, and seems to express a seasonal theme in coloration. Their faces are portraits of every emotion that passes through their consciousness; joy, loss, and murder may all dance across their expressions in a matter of moments. Only when a dawn piper is asleep or plays a soothing melody on its pipes does its expression become static and human-and through such songs, dawn pipers' heartbreaking beauty becomes truly evident. Ecology Early on in their primordial realm, dawn pipers toyed with emotion and its effects on the mutable nature of the First World. They marveled at how their plane could be transformed by an expression of strong will and passion. Their name allegedly stems from being the "musicians at the dawn of Creation." Yet, coming from the First World, they are soulless creatures and immortal on their home plane. Dawn pipers cannot hold on to their feelings, and with the passage of time their emotions slip away from them like sand through their fingers. Through study and experimentation, dawn pipers devised a means to cheat their own ephemeral nature through music. The pipers associate emotion with melody, and when their passions leave them, they recreate them from memory through their music. While music is an exercise in creativity, it also has elements of structure and pattern, and that is what the pipers retain long after other fleeting experiences fade. This is no small advantage in the highly morphic environment of the First World, allowing them to knead and shape portions of their home through the use of music and emotion. Though the dawn pipers have no strict elemental association, they may also use their music to create an elemental font through which they can channel and shape the energies of the Inner Planes. Dawn pipers are not wholly flesh and bone, as a raw creative power also infuses them-the source of the burning light that shines out of their eyes. Despite their transitory emotions, there is enough definition imposed upon their existence that they remain subject to physical laws. If killed in the First World, dawn pipers do not truly die but are reborn. The same cannot be said when they expire on other worlds. Habitat &amp; Society Dawn pipers have no formal, overarching society of their own, but they sometimes form small partnerships called choirs, which always have a prime number of members. They act as entertainers, advisors, and shapers among the fey of the First World. Outsiders find them easy to dismiss as slaves to the very emotions they conjure, but nothing could be less true. Dawn pipers are usually shrewd and manipulative, and merely play at the role of a manic social gadf ly. It is said that azatas can sometimes reason with them when they meet; otherwise, dawn pipers jockey for power and inf luence with fey beings greater than themselves. Dawn pipers are great proponents of subsuming parts of the Material Plane into the First World, yet few such incursions ever happen because they are reluctant to travel to the Material Plane, where they are mortal, unless on a matter of great importance. They rarely take mortal lovers as such dalliances seldom end happily-though when they do partake in them, there are always new melodies waiting to be improvised by which to remember the forsaken relationships. Dawn Piper Choirs A choir of dawn pipers can use their elemental fonts to absorb a part of the Material Plane into the First World by creating a reality siphon. To open a reality siphon, at least three dawn pipers must perform a musical ritual lasting 8 hours. Each piper must have its own elemental font prior to the start of the ritual, and no font can be more than 400 feet from another. At the conclusion of the ritual, the reality siphon appears, creating a 10-foot-radius hemispherical area of twisted reality that functions as an antilife shell (CL 9th). After the ritual is complete, the pipers are free to take other actions until the reality siphon fully manifests. Over the course of 1 week, the reality siphon gradually expands until it encompasses a 400-foot-radius area, at which point everything in the area encompassed by the reality siphon is fully subsumed into the First World. Destroying the elemental fonts sustaining the reality siphon before it fully manifests causes it to implode upon itself, destroying the siphon and preventing it from drawing part of the Material Plane into the First World. At the GM's discretion, certain more powerful choirs may have additional spell-like abilities, similar to the abilities a hag's coven possesses. They may also have powers related to the alteration of their environment in the First World.</Description>

    <Description_Visual>Tall and lean, this hooded figure resembles a human until the terrible face beneath the cowl is revealed-nothing but a featureless mirror, reflecting a hard, cold world.</Description_Visual>

    <SpecialAbilities>Alert Master (Su) Three times per day, a mirror man can send a brief message to a creature it is familiar with (typically its master). This effect is similar to the sending spell, but it takes only a standard action, the communication is one way, and the target cannot respond to the sending. Mirror Sight (Ex) A mirror man has no eyes, but is capable of visually perceiving through the use of blindsight, darkvision, and low-light vision. Scrying Focus (Su) Mirror men are specifically created to interact with the spell Irriseni mirror sight (Pathfinder Adventure Path #67 73) in special ways. The construct's mirrored face can serve as a known mirror, allowing the caster to see from the perspective of the construct's face with normal sight. The caster may also communicate telepathically with the mirror man. As a swift action, the mirror man can choose to remember and record up to 1 minute of what it sees. This memory is visual only and can be viewed remotely through Irriseni mirror sight or played back across its face. The mirror man can only retain 1 minute of images; when its memory is full, old memories are erased so it can remember new ones. The caster may interact with the mirror man's soul mirror even after the construct body is destroyed as long as the face itself remains unbroken. If the construct has not been destroyed, an opponent must succeed at a sunder attempt targeting the mirrored face to break the mirror. The mirrored face is considered a separate weapon with a hardness of 1 and hit points equal to the mirror man's Hit Dice. If the construct has been destroyed, the mirrored face can be smashed as a standard action. Soul Mirror (Su) The soul of a mirror man is bound within its mirrored face. As long as the face remains intact, it can be affixed to a new construct body using the same cost to create a new construct. Once a soul is bound to a mirror, the soul continues to learn, and if the mirror is later affixed to a new body, the soul retains any memories from its previous bodies. Susceptible to Mind-Affecting Effects (Ex) The self-aware and autonomous nature of a mirror man makes it susceptible to mind-affecting effects, despite the fact that it is a construct.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>At a glance, mirror men are easily mistaken for humans. They are tall, slender, and graceful and mask their true selves in fine hooded cloaks appropriate to Irrisen's eternal winter. Nevertheless, their grace is the product of precision, not elegance, and their hooded garments serve to obscure an inhuman countenance. A mirror man has no eyes, nose, or mouth. Its face is a featureless mirror, affixed atop a lifeless body. Behind this mirror is a vacant hole left behind when the body was prepared for its current use. Ecology Mirror men are constructs whose origin is less than a century old, and are typically found in larger Irriseni cities such as Whitethrone and Algidheart. Just as guardian dolls are animated with the souls of children, mirror men get their spark from adults-usually criminals. They are created to be the spies and assassins of the White Witches, and their construct nature makes them utterly loyal to the Jadwiga. Mirror men are cunning, merciless, and determined in the execution of their orders. Underneath their garments they resemble zombies, or even flesh golems. All unnecessary internal organs and fluids have been removed, and what remains is wrapped in cold muscle and skin of a grayish hue that is magically maintained and self-repairing. No eyes remain within their skulls, but the soul trapped within the mirror can sense all movement nearby. While some golems and constructs are simple replacements for guards and protectors, the mirror men of Irrisen represent a very specific design. They are intended to investigate, spy, and report, and are created with abilities carefully selected to help them fulfill these purposes. Even their ability to magically create light serves to allow the witches to see better while peering through their looking-glass faces. Mirror men are trained to be familiar with nobility of the region, to detect forgeries, and to investigate crimes. There remains a flaw in their creation, however- any caster of Irriseni mirror sight can peer through the face of any mirror man she's familiar with. The White Witches of Irrisen often assume foreigners don't know their secrets, but nothing save tradition prevents an outlander from learning the spell. A mirror man can't attempt to resist an unwanted connection, and its only recourse when used as an ambulatory sensor for someone unauthorized is to cover its face and send a warning to the witch who governs it. Habitat &amp; Society For centuries, the Iron Guard observed and recorded events in Whitethrone; its members nominally served the Jadwiga but their true allegiance was to Baba Yaga-a fact that did not go unnoticed by the descendants of the 14 queens. Under Elvanna's reign, the mirror men were created to act as the eyes and ears, not of the Iron Guard, but of the White Witches themselves. For decades, the Jadwiga Elvanna maintained that the role of the mirror men was to provide additional oversight of the kingdom, but with the recent usurpation of Baba Yaga, the mirror men's role as the White Witches' secret police has become evident. Mirror men have broad authority to question, search, and arrest anyone but the Jadwiga themselves. Even with telepathy, mirror men avoid self-expression as much as possible whenever a gesture or pointed finger will suffice. In Whitethrone, it is universally understood when a mirror man jabs a finger at someone, followed by a tap on the open palm of their other hand, it means the citizen should stand still and allow himself to be viewed through the unsettling visage of the mirror man. There is no love lost between the mirror men and any of Irrisen's monstrous citizens (or the Iron Guard, for that matter). The constructs' presence only fuels an atmosphere of paranoia and distrust as the monsters are left wondering who might be watching them as well as the native Ulfen slaves. Construction The creation of a mirror man requires a single living creature (usually human), which is killed during the process. Its manufacture requires costly alchemical reagents and a mirror faceplate crafted specifically for the creature. The creature's soul is bound to the mirror, which prevents it from continuing to the afterlife and protects it from being resurrected or raised from the dead. Most of the original creature's memories are expunged, but mirror men retain many of their originals skills; consequently, the most effective mirror men are former career criminals and foreign spies. The creation process is excruciating to the victim, and creating a mirror man constitutes an evil act.

    <IsTemplate>1</IsTemplate>
    <SpecialAbilities>Boot Stomp (Ex) A winter redcap wears heavy iron boots with spiked soles that it uses to deadly effect in combat. These boots give the winter redcap a kick attack that it can make as a secondary attack, either as part of a full-attack action or as part of its movement, just as if it had the Spring Attack feat. Heavy Weapons (Ex) A winter redcap can wield weapons sized for Medium creatures without penalty. Irreligious (Ex) Bitter and blasphemous, winter redcaps cannot stand the symbols of good-aligned religions. If a foe spends a standard action presenting such a holy symbol, any winter redcap that can see the creature must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or become frightened for 1 minute and attempt to flee. A winter redcap who successfully saves is shaken for 1 minute. Red Cap (Su) A winter redcap wears a tiny, shapeless woolen hat, dyed over and over with the blood of its victims. While wearing this cap, a winter redcap gains a +4 bonus on damage rolls (included in the above totals) and fast healing 3. These benefits are lost if the cap is removed or destroyed. Caps are not transferable, even between other redcaps. A winter redcap can create a new cap to replace a lost cap with 10 minutes of work, but until the winter redcap takes a standard action to dip the cap in the blood of a foe the winter redcap helped to kill, the cap does not grant its bonuses.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Infused with the primal power of winter's chill, a winter fey possesses the power to freeze its victims with a mere touch. It is said that this wintery power freezes the heart of any normally good fey, corrupting the creature's nature and infusing it with hatred and spite. While a winter fey is visually recognizable as being a variant of its normal counterpart, its personality is decidedly altered. Whereas most fey are merely capricious and whimsical, winter fey take pleasure in causing pain and suffering. A winter fey is the same size as its normal counterparts, but it typically weighs a bit more because of the ice crusting its body. Ecology Found mainly in the reaches of the far north and the frigid regions of the First World, winter fey live in places far too cold for most humanoids to survive without magical assistance. The harsh landscape and bone-chilling climate match the hearts of these bitter creatures. A winter fey found far from cold lands is typically acting on the orders of a liege or in pursuit of an especially wily victim, as few choose to wander so close to the "hot lands" without a particular purpose in mind. However, winter fey have been known to travel deep into warmer climates in order to play a worthy enough trick on a creature. Some winter fey are known to move south every winter in search of new creatures to steal from, torment, or maim. As cruel as a winter storm, a winter fey feels no remorse for those it hurts. For its own amusement, a winter fey leads its victims far from civilization without any means to protect themselves from the elements and then abandon them, typically leaving them to freeze to death. Such a fey creature targets the innocent and gullible simply for sinister laughs, spending months crafting an exceptional ruse and then watching it play out. Savoring such delicious cruelty is what winter fey live for. Habitat &amp; Society On Golarion, winter fey live in the cold northern realms, staying far away from the heat of summer. When winter strikes, these malevolent creatures sometimes migrate south with the snowstorms, then return to the north as quickly as they came, at the first sign of the spring thaw. Being able to craft an original and depraved trick upon a creature and share the tale of that trick is how a winter fey gains respect and ultimately a greater status among its peers. Once a winter fey plays a trick upon a creature, that creature is considered marked. Although it is not forbidden to trick a creature marked by another winter fey, young winter fey caught doing so are looked on as sloppy and unoriginal. As such, young winter fey are constantly looking for new creatures upon whom to let their wicked imaginations run wild, while their elders poach their marked targets. Sometimes winter fey work together to pull off a truly heinous yet epic trick. One of the best-known times that a group of winter fey worked together like this involved a bloody carnival of torture and death. A winter fey's characteristic icy claws are frequently stained with blood. Winter fey love nothing more than to feel the suffering they cause with their own frosty hands. Blood and gore from warm-bodied creatures are among the few sources of warmth winter fey willingly touch, and they often display a prize of their most recent murderous delight-usually a body part of one of their victims-until a new target is marked for death. Creating a Winter Fey "Winter fey" is an inherited template that can be added to any fey creature without the fire subtype, referred to hereafter as the base creature. A winter fey uses all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here. CR: As base creature +1. Alignment: Any evil. Type: The base creature's type remains fey, but it gains the cold subtype. AC: Natural armor improves by +2. Defensive Abilities: A winter fey retains the base creature's defensive abilities, and gains the following ability. Fast Healing (Su): A winter fey gains fast healing 3 when in contact with ice or snow. Speed: A winter fey retains the base creature's normal movement and gains the following. Ice Walking (Ex): A winter fey takes no penalty to speed or on Acrobatics, Climb, or Stealth checks in snowy or icy terrain or weather conditions and can walk across snow crusts or thin ice without breaking through. Attacks: A winter fey retains all the natural weapons, manufactured weapon attacks, and weapon proficiencies of the base creature. A creature with hands gains one claw attack per hand; the winter fey can strike with each of its claw attacks at its full attack bonus. A claw attack deals damage as if the winter fey RPG Bestiary 301-302). If the base creature already had claw attacks with its hands, use the winter fey claw damage only if it's better. Special Attacks: A winter fey retains the base creature's special attacks and gains the ones listed below. Frigid Touch (Su): Once per day, a winter fey may attempt a touch attack against a foe; if successful, it deals 1d6 points of Dexterity damage by freezing the blood in its victim's veins and numbing its victim to the bone. Frosty Grasp (Su): A winter fey's natural attacks, as well as any weapons it wields, deal an additional 1d6 points of cold damage. Abilities: A winter fey's Strength and Constitution increase by +2. Skills: A winter fey gains a +4 racial bonus on Survival checks when in cold environments.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Break Bones (Ex) Whenever a yaenit scores a critical hit with its bite attack, its opponent must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or have its base land speed reduced by 10 feet (to a minimum of 5 feet). This penalty remains until the affected creature takes any amount of magical healing or is healed with a successful DC 20 Heal check. The save DC is Strength-based. Hallucinatory Aura (Su) Any creature coming within 20 feet of a yaenit must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or succumb to the demon's foul, mind-warping magic. A creature affected by a yaenit's hallucinatory aura takes a -2 penalty on Will saves, caster level checks, Intelligence-based skill checks, and Wisdom-based skill checks for as long as it remains within the aura's range and 1d4-1 rounds after leaving the area of effect. This is a mind-affecting effect. Whether or not the save was successful, an affected creature is immune to the same yaenit's hallucinatory aura for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Violent progenitors of Lamashtu's earthly broods, the yaenit demons' purpose is to protect Lamashtu's priestesses and their unholy spawn. Yaenits rise from the souls of evil mortals who in life were exceptionally cruel bullies and tormentors of weaker companions, associates, minions, and siblings. Their resemblance to gnolls is no mere coincidence, as many yaenits take form from the spirits of gnolls in the Abyss. Gnolls, for their part, revere yaenits as embodiments of Lamashtu's foul will, and worship these demons as representatives of both the Mother of Monsters and her unholy designs for the devoted gnoll followers who please her. Terrifying predators, yaenits' deceptively stooped and gangly physiques belie the 300 pounds of knotted and powerful muscle tied to their solid, black bones. The average yaenit is 6-1/2 feet tall.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Burning Blindness (Su) When an azgenzak confirms a critical hit or a creature fails its save against the distraction attack of its swarming pyrocules, the azgenzak attempts to pluck out one of the target's eyes (Fortitude DC 20 negates). If the save fails, the target takes 1d6 additional points of fire damage, is sickened by pain for 1d4 rounds, and becomes permanently dazzled. If this results in the loss of all of the target's eyes, it is permanently blinded. Inversion (Ex) As a move action, an azgenzak can invert its sac-like body, turning itself inside out and exposing its innumerable burning eyes. Doing so surrounds the azgenzak with a fiery aura and activates its frightful presence ability. These abilities are suppressed when the azgenzak is not inverted. When it's inverted, creatures adjacent to the azgenzak take 2d6 points of fire damage and risk catching on fire. A successful DC 16 Reflex save halves this damage and keeps the creature from catching on fire. An inverted azgenzak loses its racial bonus to Stealth underwater and takes a further -10 penalty on Stealth checks. In addition, when inverted, an azgenzak can't swallow its victim whole; however, if it begins its turn with a creature grappled, it can revert itself as a move action and then use its swallow whole ability. A creature swallowed by an azgenzak is subject to its fiery aura and frightful presence even when the azgenzak is not inverted. Swarming Pyrocules (Su) As a full-round action, an azgenzak can disgorge a swarm of burning eyeballs. This swarm has the same statistics as a bat swarm (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 30), except it lacks the wounding special ability, which is replaced by the azgenzak's burn ability and immunity to fire. An azgenzak using this ability takes 2d6 points of damage (though damage dealt to the swarming pyrocules does not damage the azgenzak). The swarming pyrocules can't survive long separated from the azgenzak, and take 1 point of damage each round at the end of its turn. The swarming pyrocules can be reabsorbed by the azgenzak as a full-round action, healing the creature of 1d6 points of damage.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Azgenzaks, also called more prosaically "sacks of burning eyes," are shapeless predators of unfathomable appetites and undeniable malevolence. They might have congealed into existence within some forgotten crack of the Outer Rifts, escaping (or being set loose) into the Material Plane ages ago. However, many theorize that these beings are entirely natural, primeval creatures that fell into savagery or never evolved from their primitive state in the first place. Azgenzaks are roughly 8 feet in diameter and weigh over 800 pounds. Ecology Azgenzaks are amorphous, their bodies composed of a flaccid, leathery outer skin enveloping an interior of glistening, wrinkled tissue, which in turn surrounds hundreds of cilia-rimmed sockets that weep flammable mucus. An azgenzak can suppress its flames by squeezing its sac tightly closed, but it rarely does so unless it has need for stealth. If it wishes to maintain its flames even when it dives underwater, it simply enfolds a large bubble of air within its fundus, seals the aperture with a layer of mucus, and inf lates itself into a lumpy spheroid, periodically venting exhaust gases to propel itself through the water. A rush of foul-scented bubbles and brief flares of deep orange below the water's surface usually accompany such venting as jets of flame escape the azgenzak's interior and are snuffed out. Azgenzaks are primarily carnivorous, though they're able to digest any organic material, engulfing it within their flaming cavities. An azgenzak that has recently feasted-having swallowed its prey whole-might sink to the bottom of a body of water and enfold itself to slowly digest its meal, settling into a torpor for days or even weeks at a time. If undisturbed, a hibernating azgenzak might appear indistinguishable from an algae-covered boulder, a rotting log, or submerged carrion. Azgenzaks reproduce by asexual budding, which is abetted in some unknown way by the vitreous humors found within eyeballs. Its drive to extract the eyes of its prey is to further of its attempts at reproduction, as the distilled essence of the eyes it steals germinates tissue buds within the depths of its stomach. These buds then replicate and mat together into a translucent sheath of tissue, with a portion of the eyes within the azgenzak adsorbing into this sheath as it grows. Once a sufficient sheath-mass has accreted, it begins sloughing off from the parent azgenzak's stomach walls, and is eventually disgorged and discarded in a steaming puddle of semisolid translucent slime shot through with eyeballs. Now ravenously hungry, the parent moves on to feast elsewhere and replenish its discarded mass. Meanwhile, the newly birthed azgenzak begins to darken and congeal, baked from within by the unquenchable heat of its burning eyes, even as its outer tissues are tempered by exposure to open air and water, gradually toughening into a mottled brown outer skin. Gorging itself on organic matter, the newly formed azgenzak matures within a month and can begin to unleash the swarming pyrocules that are its deadly signature. Habitat &amp; Society Azgenzaks are solitary creatures, despising the presence of others of their kind as rivals for their hunting terrain. They prefer to make their dens in murky lakes, though they are equally happy in swamps, bogs, and even slow-moving rivers. They are not powerful swimmers and avoid fast-moving water, though they are perfectly capable of climbing out of the water and traversing land in an undulant slither. Their malleable mass is able to ooze over, around, and between obstacles that might block the passage of a more solid creature. Azgenzaks are sometimes confused with will-o'-wisps in folktales and legends, as both dwell in boglands and are blamed for mysterious marshlights that lead travelers to their doom. This is because azgenzaks are thought of more in terms of the swarming pyrocules they unleash rather than their true bodies-the strings of floating, flaming eyes are often believed to be the true creature and the "bag" of its body a gate to Hell, a fleshy opening into the Abyss, or a shroud stitched from the skins of its victims. In many cultures, strange bubbling and dancing marshlights below the water or bobbing above bogs are seen as portents of death even when seen in the far distance, regardless of the creature responsible. In lands where azgenzaks are known to dwell, animals are often blindered at night and children are taught to keep shutters and curtains drawn tight to avoid seeing the deadly lights. In truth, azgenzaks are fairly simple creatures, mostly interested in their next meal. That said, they prefer the flesh of sentient victims and the screams of victims perishing in fear and fire. While they have no love for will-o'-wisps, they do sense a certain kinship with them, and more importantly they perceive the advantages of working with them to secure prey. Will-o'-wisps themselves offer no sustenance for an azgenzak, with their nearly immaterial bodies, but an azgenzak's ability to instill fear has much to offer hunting will-o'-wisps. The two creatures thus sometimes work in concert, with the azgenzak feasting physically upon its victims while the will-o'-wisp feeds psychically.</Description>

    <Description>Andrazkus are thugs who use their strength to lord over weaker creatures. Their hatred is cold and seething, prone to suddenly snapping in an avalanche of ice and crushing blows. Birthed from the protomatter of the Abyss with natural gifts for tracking and subduing prey, they are sometimes used as trackers and jailors by more powerful demons who need to find lost prisoners and slaves. From the waist up these demons are built much like strong, hairy humans or dwarves, but with exaggerated proportions resembling those of a gorilla. Their thick necks sport bristling manes that merge with the hair on their backs, and their flat faces bear two ramlike horns and cold eyes filled with hate. Their breath is a freezing fog, and their teeth are small but numerous, like a shark's. An andrazku's legs seem small in comparison to its torso, bend backward like a satyr's, and end in large cloven hooves. Their skin is the dead blue of a frozen corpse or a frost giant. Their top-heavy builds mean they have difficulty standing upright and normally assume a hunched posture; many prefer to walk and run on all fours, like apes. An andrazku is 7 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs 450 pounds. Ecology An andrazku forms from the soul of a chaotic mortal who hated women and used his or her power to oppress and demean them, such as a tyrant who selectively enforced laws against women, a priest who preached that women are the source of all sin, or a father who secretly beat his wives and daughters for their supposed failures. For this reason andrazkus are known to scholars as "misogyny demons." Few of these souls dared to greater crimes (which would cause their souls to become incubi or babaus), nor were they once mortals who hated women but never acted upon their hatred-an andrazku only forms from a soul filled with suff icient hatred toward women to provoke action, but that is hampered by enough cowardice to prevent it from performing acts of greater evil. Most of them were male mortals, but an especially misogynistic evil female creature might become an andrazku in the Abyss. An andrazku grows excited when it senses its prey's fear, but becomes frustrated if the hunt lasts for too long. Despite these demons' masculine appearance and aggression, most of them are impotent and some completely lack genitalia, rendering their lust pointless. Their nature is to berate, degrade, and beat; they tend to kill only when they feel an urge to eat, when their stymied passion becomes too great to tolerate, or when they are mocked for their shortcomings. An andrazku prefers to attack with its bite and fists (often contemptuously slapping foes, minions, and prey with an open hand), but a vicious one may use a scourge and jagged-bladed sword as if pretending to be a balor. Sadistic and cruel, andrazkus have been known to chase down their prey, batter it for a while, and then release it, giving it enough of a head start that it thinks it has a chance of escaping. The andrazkus then track it down (using locate creature and teleport) to repeat the cycle again. An andrazku in a position of authority likes to mark its minions and slaves with a scar on one side of the face indicating the demon's ownership. The demon typically uses its breath weapon to freeze a metal brand until it is cold enough to leave a permanent mark. If a slave is resistant or immune to cold, the demon uses a knife to carve its mark into one side of the creature's face. Because of their long-simmering tempers and magical abilities, andrazkus are often called "cold demons," and they mainly live in frigid Abyssal realms such as Jhuvumirak, home of demon lord Kostchtchie. Their intolerance of fire (despite their demonic resistance to it) and the cowardly nature of their origin-sin make them laughingstocks among demons (particularly babaus and incubi); as a result, andrazkus are sullen, resentful, and prone to take out their frustrations on weaker creatures- especially if said creatures are female. Andrazkus prefer to lair in ice caves or tunnels dug out of hard-packed snow. Some take advantage of their cold immunity and strong swimming ability to live in simple shelters on ice floes. An andrazku's hooves and huge hands allow it to cling to ice as though it were rough stone, preventing it from slipping and allowing it to use much of the vertical space in its lair to store treasure and observe intruders. Habitat &amp; Society Andrazkus loathe associating with more powerful female demons in any way, and curse under their breath at mariliths and similar demons of great stature. Among female demons of similar power, they are quick with clever words, believable boasts, and secret confessions of desire, but these are all lies to disguise the hatred crackling beneath the surface. If given the opportunity, an andrazku would capture and torture a succubus merely because she is female (though a succubus is physically more powerful than a lone misogyny demon, and the hairy brutes have to gang up to have any chance of defeating a "weakling" succubus). Succubi and mariliths are aware of these simple-minded feelings held by andrazkus and they delight in tormenting the brutish creatures. Those female demons know they hold greater strength and power than andrazkus, and they enjoy lording over the creatures, even going so far as to kidnap them from time to time, bringing them to their own lairs and forcing the creatures into servitude. Andrazkus band together for strength, using their telepathy to silently coordinate their attacks. They often taunt their prey telepathically, either with words, promises of violence, or mocking laughter. When set loose on the Material Plane, an andrazku usually forces itself into a position of power over a humanoid tribe. Some ally with frost giant tribes, especially those who worship Kostchtchie. Duller ones find better company among girallons and dire apes. Summoning Andrazku Andrazkus are receptive to flattery about their size and strength. They like offers of weapons and strength-enhancing items as payment for their services. They can be assigned to guard, hunt, or retrieve; any Charisma check attempted as part a spell to convince an andrazku to undertake a mission other than these kinds of tasks takes a -2 penalty. A female summoner has a -10 penalty on all Charisma checks made to bargain unless the caster acts inferior and unworthy of the demon's aid.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Blizzard Breath (Su) A kokogiak's breath weapon is a polar gale so bitterly cold that it saps vigor from those it touches. Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a kokogiak can expel a 60-foot cone of blistering arctic winds, dealing 8d6 points of cold damage to all creatures struck. A successful DC 23 Reflex save halves this damage. Any creature damaged by this attack must then succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or become fatigued (or exhausted if it was already fatigued). The save DCs are Constitution-based. Forlorn Gaze (Su) As a standard action, a kokogiak can lock its black eyes on a target within 60 feet to fascinate the creature. A successful DC 20 Will save negates this effect. Creatures that fail the save are fascinated and they see they kokogiak as a lost loved one, trusted friend in danger, or ally in desperate need. Once a creature is fascinated, the kokogiak can compel the creature to move toward it. Once adjacent, the creature is flat-footed against the kokogiak's attacks, but the creature receives a new saving throw at the beginning of its turn to break the fascination. This is a mind-affecting effect and the save DC is Charisma-based. Ice Walker (Ex) A kokogiak takes no penalty to speed or on Acrobatics, Climb, or Stealth checks in snowy or icy terrain or weather conditions. It can walk across snow crusts or thin ice without breaking through. In addition, a kokogiak can choose to not leave tracks when moving in this type of terrain. Penetrating Sight (Ex) A kokogiak's sight is not affected by its own fog cloud or solid fog spell-like abilities. In addition, a kokogiak does not take any penalties on Perception checks while its snowing. Sound Imitation (Ex) A kokogiak can mimic any voice or sound it has heard by making a successful Bluff check against a listener's Sense Motive check.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The kokogiak (called qupqugiaq by some tribes) is a deadly predator of the far northern wastes. At first glance, it appears to be a simple ravening beast or an enormous, unnaturally deformed polar bear, yet its raw power and cunning are legendary in the tales of northern nomads. Its name in some places is synonymous with cabin fever or deep-winter hallucinations that drive folk to desperation and madness, rushing out into the frozen wild in pursuit of some long-lost lover only to become lost themselves, victims of the kokogiak's dreadful might. Kokogiaks have an elongated neck, and are nearly 20 feet long from tail to nose. Over a dozen feet high at the shoulder, kokogiaks weigh between 6 and 8 tons. Ecology Kokogiaks are amphibious in their habits, comfortable in and out of the water, though they are not able to breathe water as well as air. They spend a great deal of their time in the water, hunting seals, walruses, squids, and even whales in coastal waters and beneath the winter ice. While kokogiaks must surface periodically to breathe, their powerful claws enable them to rip through floating pack ice and make air holes nearly wherever they wish. Creating such air holes is actually a hunting technique- they lie in wait near the holes for seals and their ilk to surface to breathe, snatching their prey in their jaws and dragging it up onto the ice to feast. Kokogiaks also use the same trick in reverse, lurking underwater just below gaps in the ice and seizing prey traversing the ice above, or along rocky coastlines when the pack ice recedes. Even predatory creatures like polar bears and winter wolves might be dragged into the water to be drowned and devoured, and desperate kokogiaks are even known to scale arctic sea cliffs during spring thaws to feast on newborn seabirds and eggs, lapping up entire nests in a single flick of the tongue. While they are well adapted to hunting in and around coastal icepacks, kokogiaks also roam far inland to prowl continental ice sheets. The same tactics kokogiaks use for hunting along the water's edge serve them well in the deep snowdrifts and icy spires and crevasses of the polar reaches. Kokogiaks scale rocky and icy peaks to lair in dens inaccessible to most creatures. From such high vantage points, they observe passersby; then, calling upon supernatural blinding fogs, they either descend upon their prey from above, snatching a target and dragging it to their elevated lairs, or burrow underneath and burst up from below, hauling prey into their frigid dens. Habitat &amp; Society Kokogiaks live in cold arctic regions, though in winter they sometimes wander into the subarctic tundra and occasionally even into the colder latitudes of temperate climes. Those venturing so far south make their homes amid the glaciers and alpine wilderness of high mountains. While most return to the forever-winter of the arctic after taking their fill of warmer climes' abundant prey, a few make their homes permanently below the arctic circle, where their predations lend their mountain homes a deadly reputation. Such alpine kokogiaks descend with the winter storms into the huddled villages in the valleys below, luring the unwary to their doom and leaving a trail of death and terror in their wakes. In communities near a kokogiak's mountain, when the first heavy storms of winter strike, locals sometimes stake animals (or even rarely an unlucky member of the community, chosen by lottery) out in the cold in an attempt to propitiate the kokogiak's hunger and turn aside its wrath from the rest of the community. Kokogiaks are more common in the subarctic and arctic, however, and they show no loyalty or preferential treatment to any that cross their path. They occasionally enter into alliances with creatures that will hunt for them and bring them living victims to torment and eviscerate at their leisure. They are cruel and capricious masters apt to turn on those who displease them in any way or just to ensure that others serving them do not doubt their power. More often, kokogiaks extract tribute from arctic and tundra dwelling tribes, sometimes in treasure but more often in the form of sacrifice. When refused, a kokogiak seeks to punish the unwilling by using its magic to inveigle members of that tribe to wander off from their homes and into the kokogiak's waiting clutches. Victims lured away in this fashion may simply be devoured, but the cruel beast often leaves behind bloodstained clothes or more grisly trophies torn from its victims' remains, artfully displayed for the friends and family of the deceased to find. So does the kokogiak remind them of the price of defiance. Kokogiaks are mostly solitary, though mated pairs do sometimes join forces to spread terror wherever they roam or to take down powerful rivals. Kokogiak cubs are usually encouraged to fight one another for survival, struggling to show their dominance until only one remains. Weaklings are killed and eaten or driven out into the snows to survive or not. When the strongest cub approaches maturity, the kokogiak parents are faced with a choice: drive out the youngling when it is strong enough to survive but not yet strong enough to challenge its elders, or be prepared to face its challenge within the family group. Such challenges are usually directed at the parent of its own gender, as the youth seeks to drive out and take the place of its father or mother, proving its worthiness to take its surviving parent as its own mate.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Curse of Misery (Su) As a full-round action, a sangoi can deliver its curse to an adjacent humanoid as a melee touch attack. If the target fails its saving throw, the sangoi gains the benefit of aid (caster level equal to the target's Hit Dice). In addition, a sangoi gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws, and opposed skill checks against any creature affected by its curse of misery. A creature that successfully saves can not be affected by the same sangoi's curse for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based. Curse of Misery: Touch-contact; save Will DC 19; frequency 1 day; effect permanent crushing despair. Hear Heartbeat (Ex) A sangoi can hear the beating hearts of living creatures nearby, granting it blindsense 30 feet and blindsight 5 feet; it can locate all creatures taking bleed damage within 30 feet as if it had blindsight. This ability does not reveal the location of creatures without hearts, including elementals, oozes, plants, undead, and incorporeal creatures. Horrific Critical (Ex) When a sangoi enters a blood rage, its claws and teeth elongate and sharpen, threatening a critical hit on a roll of 18-20 (in addition to the other benefits of blood rage). If a sangoi reduces a humanoid to -1 or fewer hit points with a critical hit from one of its natural weapons, it can tear out the target's heart and consume it as a free action (Fortitude DC 19 negates), killing it instantly. If successful, the sangoi gains 1d8 temporary hit points and a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength. Any humanoid within 30 feet who witnesses this attack must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or become shaken and sickened for 1d4 rounds (this is a mind-affecting fear effect). The save DCs are Charisma-based. Sideways Glance (Su) Sangois fade from view when in a creature's peripheral vision. They automatically gain concealment against creatures that they flank with another creature (another sangoi or otherwise). They can also attempt a Bluff check to feint in combat as a swift action, but only against a foe that can clearly see them. Sunlight Transparency (Ex) Direct sunlight causes a sangoi to partially fade from view. Their bodies become almost transparent (20% miss chance), and they become fatigued and take a -10 penalty on Disguise checks as long as they remain in direct sunlight.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Sangois are malevolent nocturnal fey that haunt small towns and graveyards. Because of their taste for blood and their similar habits, they are sometimes mistaken for vampires. Sangoi appear as short, emaciated humanoids seldom over 4 feet tall and weighing 35 to 40 pounds. Ecology Sangois thirst for the blood of the living, preferring humanoid blood, but settling for animal blood when humanoids are in short supply or when they are operating in disguise and do not wish to reveal their presence with an open attack. Though it is much harder to acquire, they are especially fond of the blood of good-aligned magical beasts, unicorns in particular. While blood provides physical nourishment for them, they also draw psychic sustenance from inf licting anguish and despair. Sangois are expert trappers, catching large and small animals with magic or mundane snares. Trapped beasts might be mutilated for a sangoi's pleasure, though the wicked fey more likely dominates them and uses them to commit murder and mischief. Habitat &amp; Society Sangois are natives of the fey realms of the First World, but they spend little time there. Most of their time is spent roaming the Material Plane, lurking in shadows and places where death and sorrow linger, such as graveyards and ruins. They are wanderers, moving from village to village in search of their next victims. When a target is located, a sangoi (or, rarely, a pair of sangois working together) seeks to isolate the victim in order to murder it and take its form. The sangoi poses as its victim, while draining the emotional, mental, and physical energy out of those that give them succor with its curse of misery. Sangoi consider themselves hunters of a sort, seeking children born with certain unique characteristics or deformities, such as those born covered with a caul, or who bear a particular birthmark or hair or eye color. Sangois fear those with such marks, whatever they might be, believing they render them powerless against such creatures and that if those with the marks are able to grow to maturity, they will bring ruin to the sangoi. Each individual sangoi has its own particular mark it grows to fear. Children so marked are spirited away from their mortal parents and slain, sold as slaves to an evil fey master, or simply imprisoned in the depths of a sangoi's lair, all to quell whatever threat the sangois believe they pose. When such a child is found, a sangoi begins lurking about the home in the guise of an animal and might even take the form of a pet to attract the child's affection. Its curse falls upon the household with this infiltration, though sangois credit their chosen targets with immunity to their powers, or even the ability to block their powers from affecting others. Sangois attempt to abduct their targets at birth when possible, but often they do not discover them until a target is older. In such cases, sangois try to kill or kidnap their targets using dominated wild animals or traps set up to look like natural accidents. Once a victim has been taken, a sangoi changes its shape to assume the victim's form, usually spending several days reading the victim's thoughts or speaking with its corpse to learn about it so it might better impersonate him. The sangoi then returns to the victim's home and assumes its life, going about his daily business while keeping out of direct sunlight when possible, often feigning illness or injury. Once the sangoi enters its victim's home, its curse of misery begins to take hold, sapping the life and spirit from the family and friends of its victim. The sangoi amuses itself with the abuse and murder of domestic animals through traps and magical compulsion, and calls foul weather to cast a pall upon the house while it waits for the family of its victim to slip into ennui. Once those in the house fall into utter despair, the sangoi plans elaborate murders in which it renders its targets helpless, often with traps using common household objects and implements, and then carves out and greedily devours the hearts of its helpless victims, savoring the sour tang of fear that lingers in broken hearts even after death.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Skyrunner (Su) When charging, running, or taking a double move, a svathurim can stride across open air as if it were using air walk. This movement is very taxing, and a svathurim must succeed at a DC 14 Constitution check at the end of each round it uses this ability to avoid being fatigued for 1 minute. This DC increases by 2 each round after the first. Returning to the ground resets the DC to 14, but does not negate any ongoing fatigue or exhaustion. A svathurim cannot trample when using this ability. Thunderous Trample (Su) Any creature damaged by a svathurim's trample attack must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1 minute. The save DC is Constitution-based. Undersized Weapons (Ex) Although a svathurim is Huge, its upper torso is the same size as that of a Large humanoid. As a result, it wields weapons as if they were one size category smaller than their actual size (Large for most svathurim).</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Ancient tales claim the first svathurims spawned from Thremyr, akin to the creation stories of frost giants, ice trolls, winter wolves, and other creatures of snow and ice. The stories claim that when Thremyr fell into the Steaming Sea, he shed great icebergs that transformed into smaller copies of the god himself. The frost giants, spawned from his shedding body, worship this slumbering god as their creator, and thus consider svathurims their kin. The hindquarters of an adult svathurim are up to 10 feet tall and 16 feet long, while their giant trunk and head reach up to 18 feet on average. Svathurims typically weigh over 5 tons and may live up to 500 years, far longer than their frost giant kin. Ecology Svathurims dwell deep in the frozen wastes of the tundra and arctic regions of Golarion, amid the great glaciers covering the Crown of the World. They occasionally travel along the frozen shores of polar seas, hunting seals, walruses, and whales that venture too close to shore or dragging vast nets through subarctic shallows during salmon runs. It is uncommon for svathurims to live in the vast boreal forests of the north, where their great bulk impedes movement among the trees, though some clans do dwell in the high mountains, springing from peak to peak in prodigious leaps and using their supernatural skyborne gallops. Svathurims are omnivorous and always hungry, able to subsist on scrub plants and kelp in times of great need, or even to eke out bare subsistence on the algae and lichen embedded in ice and rocks. However, they greatly prefer fresh, uncooked meat, and will devour every scrap of whatever they kill. Their grinding teeth are capable of reducing bone to meal, so even the toughest of a victim's remains generally end up in a svathurim's gullet. In the cold and pitiless environment of the north, nothing can be wasted. Svathurim males outnumber females by a wide margin, and these creatures are indiscriminate in their mating habits. The rare svathurim mares are little more selective in their affections than the males, and there is no shortage of males willing to court them. Ironically, many adult male svathurim are killed or wounded in competition for the attentions of females, either maimed and driven off by more dominant males or slain and presented as a trophy to prove worthiness to a female. Female svathurim are never monogamous, though, as mating with many males confuses the issue of parentage enough to keep their offspring safe from the predations of many adult males, lest a male inadvertently eradicate a foal svathurim that may be his own flesh and blood. Habitat &amp; Society Svathurims live in clans, typically headed by the strongest and most accomplished hunter in the group, whether male or female. In some clans, svathurims gain status by the number of offspring they produce, though parentage is diff icult to prove for males and leads to frequent disputes. Where females are both strong and fertile, they are able to assert dominance both by their own strength and by the loyalty and support of those children willing to fight for them. Of course, no svathurim can feel too secure in his position, as once-loyal supporters may shift their allegiance on a whim, and even faithful children may decide that they have grown strong enough to betray their parent to a rival or gather support (often from siblings) to take power in their own right. Svathurims sometimes build large corrals of stone, ice, or rarely bone or wood where such materials are available in plenty. Usually unroofed, these monolithic barriers serve mostly to keep predators away from their young or to protect their stores of treasure or food gathered by the clan from raiders. A rare few svathurims build more secure enclosed lodges or delve permanent hostels in caves. Svathurims that choose to settle in one area are most likely to live among frost giants. Frost giants view svathurims with a mix of fear, respect, awe, and revulsion. Most know well the tale of the svathurims' creation, and while not all take this as evidence of pseudo-divinity and a shared creation myth, few deny the svathurims' speed, strength, and skill at hunting and killing. For some giant clans, satisfying a svathurim's whims is a small price to pay for the advantages gained by an alliance with them Svathurims collect treasure as frost giants do, favoring precious metals in raw nuggets that are then hammered into crude tribal jewelry. Bracelets, armlets, and rings and chains they can braid into their hair, beards, and long horse-like tails are favored treasures, as are inlays and carvings made of mammoth or walrus ivory. Those in subarctic regions collect amber and rare boreal hardwoods, polishing the latter to a luxurious shine and engraving them with runic inscriptions and genealogies both real and imagined.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Skyrunner (Su) When charging, running, or taking a double move, a svathurim can stride across open air as if it were using air walk. This movement is very taxing, and a svathurim must succeed at a DC 14 Constitution check at the end of each round it uses this ability to avoid being fatigued for 1 minute. This DC increases by 2 each round after the first. Returning to the ground resets the DC to 14, but does not negate any ongoing fatigue or exhaustion. A svathurim cannot trample when using this ability. Thunderous Trample (Su) Any creature damaged by a svathurim's trample attack must succeed at a DC 22 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1 minute. The save DC is Constitution-based. Undersized Weapons (Ex) Although a svathurim is Huge, its upper torso is the same size as that of a Large humanoid. As a result, it wields weapons as if they were one size category smaller than their actual size (Large for most svathurim).</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Ancient tales claim the first svathurims spawned from Thremyr, akin to the creation stories of frost giants, ice trolls, winter wolves, and other creatures of snow and ice. The stories claim that when Thremyr fell into the Steaming Sea, he shed great icebergs that transformed into smaller copies of the god himself. The frost giants, spawned from his shedding body, worship this slumbering god as their creator, and thus consider svathurims their kin. The hindquarters of an adult svathurim are up to 10 feet tall and 16 feet long, while their giant trunk and head reach up to 18 feet on average. Svathurims typically weigh over 5 tons and may live up to 500 years, far longer than their frost giant kin. Ecology Svathurims dwell deep in the frozen wastes of the tundra and arctic regions of Golarion, amid the great glaciers covering the Crown of the World. They occasionally travel along the frozen shores of polar seas, hunting seals, walruses, and whales that venture too close to shore or dragging vast nets through subarctic shallows during salmon runs. It is uncommon for svathurims to live in the vast boreal forests of the north, where their great bulk impedes movement among the trees, though some clans do dwell in the high mountains, springing from peak to peak in prodigious leaps and using their supernatural skyborne gallops. Svathurims are omnivorous and always hungry, able to subsist on scrub plants and kelp in times of great need, or even to eke out bare subsistence on the algae and lichen embedded in ice and rocks. However, they greatly prefer fresh, uncooked meat, and will devour every scrap of whatever they kill. Their grinding teeth are capable of reducing bone to meal, so even the toughest of a victim's remains generally end up in a svathurim's gullet. In the cold and pitiless environment of the north, nothing can be wasted. Svathurim males outnumber females by a wide margin, and these creatures are indiscriminate in their mating habits. The rare svathurim mares are little more selective in their affections than the males, and there is no shortage of males willing to court them. Ironically, many adult male svathurim are killed or wounded in competition for the attentions of females, either maimed and driven off by more dominant males or slain and presented as a trophy to prove worthiness to a female. Female svathurim are never monogamous, though, as mating with many males confuses the issue of parentage enough to keep their offspring safe from the predations of many adult males, lest a male inadvertently eradicate a foal svathurim that may be his own flesh and blood. Habitat &amp; Society Svathurims live in clans, typically headed by the strongest and most accomplished hunter in the group, whether male or female. In some clans, svathurims gain status by the number of offspring they produce, though parentage is diff icult to prove for males and leads to frequent disputes. Where females are both strong and fertile, they are able to assert dominance both by their own strength and by the loyalty and support of those children willing to fight for them. Of course, no svathurim can feel too secure in his position, as once-loyal supporters may shift their allegiance on a whim, and even faithful children may decide that they have grown strong enough to betray their parent to a rival or gather support (often from siblings) to take power in their own right. Svathurims sometimes build large corrals of stone, ice, or rarely bone or wood where such materials are available in plenty. Usually unroofed, these monolithic barriers serve mostly to keep predators away from their young or to protect their stores of treasure or food gathered by the clan from raiders. A rare few svathurims build more secure enclosed lodges or delve permanent hostels in caves. Svathurims that choose to settle in one area are most likely to live among frost giants. Frost giants view svathurims with a mix of fear, respect, awe, and revulsion. Most know well the tale of the svathurims' creation, and while not all take this as evidence of pseudo-divinity and a shared creation myth, few deny the svathurims' speed, strength, and skill at hunting and killing. For some giant clans, satisfying a svathurim's whims is a small price to pay for the advantages gained by an alliance with them Svathurims collect treasure as frost giants do, favoring precious metals in raw nuggets that are then hammered into crude tribal jewelry. Bracelets, armlets, and rings and chains they can braid into their hair, beards, and long horse-like tails are favored treasures, as are inlays and carvings made of mammoth or walrus ivory. Those in subarctic regions collect amber and rare boreal hardwoods, polishing the latter to a luxurious shine and engraving them with runic inscriptions and genealogies both real and imagined.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Adaptive Camouflage (Ex) A stormghost's hide shifts coloration over time to match that of its environment. Choose a ranger favored terrain type. A stormghost gains a +4 racial bonus on Stealth checks within that terrain type. A stormghost moving into a different terrain type must remain there for 1d4 weeks before the racial bonus applies to the new terrain type. Impaling Leap (Ex) As a standard action, a stormghost can jump into the air and land on a single target at least one size category smaller than itself, using its spiky legs to impale the victim. The target must succeed at a DC 25 Reflex save or it takes 4d8+12 points of piercing damage and is pinned. If the stormghost chooses to maintain the pin, it must succeed at a combat maneuver check as normal. Pinned foes take damage each from the impaling leap each round if they don't escape. The save DC is Constitution-based. See in Fog (Ex) A stormghost can see in fog and foglike conditions without penalty. Static Aura (Su) A stormghost can surround itself with crackling electricity that leaps from its body, affecting nearby creatures. All creatures within 5 feet of the stormghost take 2d6 points of electricity damage at the beginning of the stormghost's turn. Static Blast (Su) As a standard action, a stormghost can focus its static charge into a bolt, releasing it in a 40-foot line that deals 6d6 points of electricity damage. A successful DC 25 Reflex save halves this damage. A stormghost can use its static blast once every 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Bestial hunters that prowl the mountains of Triaxus, stormghosts are a deadly threat to all creatures that stumble across their path. Triaxians attributed the name stormghost to these creatures because of their ability to conjure malignant weather and attack unseen. Stormghosts typically attack in remote mountainous areas, leaping down on their victims from cliff sides and ambushing them in blind mountain passes. Constantly in search of food, stormghosts are excellent hunters and trackers. These predators are completely unafraid of engaging with any target, and thus pose a risk to the humanoids of the planet- and even the dragons. As with Triaxians, stormghosts' appearances vary depending on the season. Thankfully, stormghosts are extremely rare, but the creatures live exceedingly long lives. A stormghost's regeneration diminishes long-term degradation of its body, allowing it to live for over 2,000 years. A stormghost stands nearly 8 feet tall in its regular posture, but can extend its legs to reach up to 14 feet. Formed of muscled flesh and hardened chitin, a stormghost weighs roughly 1,500 pounds. Ecology Stormghosts are apex predators in Triaxus's hills and mountains; a few even make their way to the lowlands. A stormghost is ephemeral like a phantom, and its coloration and ability to become invisible give rise to part of its common name, as victims are typically unaware of the creature's presence until it is far too late. It can also call down storms and banks of fog-the source of the other part of its common name-and can even conjure darkness. Stormghosts themselves, however, can see through fog and darkness, and possess other specialized senses. While the creatures have no recognizable nose, they are capable of tracking their prey by scent using a specialized sensory organ found on the lower part of their torsos. This organ picks up faint chemical signatures with such accuracy that a stormghost can differentiate between two creatures of the same type and recall with perfect detail an individual creature's signature for years after first encountering it. As with all successful hunters, stormghosts' senses and tenacity make them difficult to evade. These traits, in addition to their superior stamina, help stormghosts doggedly hunt down prey that initially escapes their clutches. Exceptionally single-minded, stormghosts live to hunt and hate losing their quarry, and they persistently pursue their fleeing prey, foregoing sleep and ignoring other victims that might be easier to take down-even if they're ravenous-in order to make their desired kill. Stormghosts undergo a change during Triaxus's transitional seasons, shifting their coloration to match their environment. In the winter, stormghosts have an icy white hide that allows them to better conceal themselves in the snow. As summer comes and the planet begins to thaw, stormghosts' hides darken and a splotched coloration of grays and browns emerges. This coloration allows them to hide themselves in the mountainous terrain in which they live. Habitat &amp; Society Stormghosts are solitary creatures that despise sharing their hunting grounds with other creatures, especially other stormghosts. When another predator begins hunting in the same region as a stormghost, the stormghost shifts its predation to that creature, tracking it down and consuming it. The exception to this is when another stormghost trespasses upon its hunting grounds. While the stormghost still tracks down and kills its competition as it would another creature, it does not consume the rival stormghost, finding the flesh of its own kind completely unpalatable, and instead ritualistically butchers its competitor and leaves the corpse as a sign that this territory is already claimed. Stormghosts are exceedingly rare; fewer than 1,000 have been spotted, according to records kept by dragonriders of the Skyfire Mandate. Many of these sightings, made safely from the back of a dragonkin, are believed to be of the same stormghost, leading many scholars to estimate that the population might be much smaller, with a few at most living in the Parapet Mountains. A naturalist in Preita recently published a journal detailing his journey in search for evidence of a stormghost, as tales of these and other vicious beasts are fashionable in the cosmopolitan cities of the Allied Territories. In this journal, he postulates that stormghosts are aliens from another world in the solar system, or perhaps beyond. Their long lives, regenerative capabilities, robust physical form, yet low population numbers suggest this hypothesis is plausible. Although this researcher clearly lacks a greater understanding of worlds beyond Triaxus, his findings on the otherworldly origins of stormghosts are indeed quite accurate. On a planet in a nearby solar system, stormghosts were grown in facilities to be biological probes deployed on specific planets for 2,000 years before they would be retrieved. During their time on those worlds, they are tasked, compelled by their very genesis and the urge of every cell, to kill and consume organic life. Over the course of their lives, a gland within their torsos at the base of the neck collects samples of every kill. These samples can be collected by the stormghost's creators and analyzed. What they are searching for is anyone's guess, but the number of stormghosts on Triaxus suggests these unknown creators seek a comprehensive collection of dragons and dragonkind.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Seasoned (Ex) Triaxians suffer no harm from being in hot or cold environments depending on whether they are Summerborn or Winterborn. Summerborn Triaxians can exist comfortably in conditions between 90 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit without having to attempt Fortitude saves. Winterborn Triaxians can exist comfortably in conditions between 40 and -20 degrees Fahrenheit without having to attempt Fortitude saves. When in conditions of severe cold or heat, Triaxians only have to attempt Fortitude saves once per hour instead of once every 10 minutes. Transitional Triaxians do not have this ability.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Triaxians are the dominant race on the planet Triaxus, a world whose erratic orbit causes exceptionally long and disparate seasons. Though eerily similar to humans, elves, and the other mammalian humanoids common on Golarion, Triaxians have developed certain adaptations to their environment that mark them as indisputably alien. Just like human ethnicities, Triaxian populations vary in size, weight, and other distinguishing physical characteristics, based primarily on the geographical regions in which they reside. Most Triaxians, both males and females, are around 6 feet tall but somewhat lean compared to humans, rarely weighing more than 200 pounds. Their ears are elongated, but rather than being pointed like elves or half lings, these appendages are instead notched in a feathered or comblike pattern. The flaps created by these notches constantly move to adjust the ear's shape, operating both consciously and unconsciously to help Triaxians focus on specific sounds, not unlike the maneuverable ears of dogs, cats, and other such animals. Like many creatures on their world, Triaxians have evolved to shift along with their environment, resulting in differences between generations of the same family that would seem bizarre to humanoids from Golarion. In the warm summer years, Triaxians are completely hairless, with skin that ranges from deep red to coffee-colored to charcoal black. This configuration allows them to better survive in the sweltering heat of the planet's tropical summers, with the increased melanin in their dark skin protecting them from the sun's intense rays. These Summerborn Triaxians, as they are known, breed true for many generations-yet as the planet begins its rapid seasonal shift, so do the Triaxians. Newborn Triaxians begin to evince new adaptations to the cooling environment, and by the time winter has come on in full, Triaxians change markedly: their pale bodies are covered in fine, insulating white fur like that of an ermine, while their eyes narrow to elongated slits to protect against snowblindness. These new traits similarly breed true until the seasons begin to change once more, at which point the eyes widen and fur recedes, starting the cycle anew. Just as Triaxians differ physically depending on which season they're born into, so do their cultures and customs change. Winterborn Triaxians are defined by the hardship of a world whose very environment seeks to starve or freeze them. They tend to be stolid, hardworking people, with an ironclad sense of honor stemming from the knowledge that in a Triaxian winter, a broken promise can mean death for a whole clan. Even within large communities, the focus remains on survival for one's family and friends, with individuals willing and ready to share, serve, and die to protect the group. Oaths of friendship are serious affairs; once given they are rarely transgressed, and doing so risks a blood feud. With the exception of those nomadic hunter tribes that migrate in pursuit of herd animals, most settlements are permanent and fortified against the predatory horrors that stalk the blinding blizzards. Summerborn Triaxians, by contrast, are born into a world of plenty. With forests full of fruit and game, and glaciers receding to reveal vast tracts of fertile earth, the attachment to cold stone fortresses and cramped cities weakens, and Triaxians spread out across the landscape. For many, it is a time of nomadism, living in small bands and temporary structures, or else participating in great waves of land-grabs as homesteaders. Though they still have the weight of history to remind them of the hardships of their ancestors-and those yet to come for their descendants- Summerborn Triaxians tend to be an easy-going, generous people, quick to accept outsiders, to break with their clans and families and strike out on their own, and to challenge convention in pursuit of greater goals. They are simultaneously less hardened and more likely to go to war, for with the business of survival taking less energy and new territory constantly being settled, leaders have more time and resources to dispute borders and jockey for power. Historically, Summerborn Triaxians are those most likely to visit other planes or worlds, as the drive to explore their newly thawed planet also leads them to look beyond it. Transitional Triaxians occupy a much smaller portion of the Triaxian adaptation cycle than either the Summerborn or Winterborn-usually no more than a generation each orbital year-and often play an uncomfortable role in their society. To Summerborn Triaxians, a Transitional child is an ill omen-a sign that winter approaches, and that the time of plenty is drawing to a close. The first such individuals to appear are often hidden or slain by their parents, and vilified by those rebellious fools and leaders who believe that Transitional children actively bring on the winter, or who simply don't want to begin the long and arduous process of preparing for future generations' survival. Transitional children born at the tail of winter, on the other hand, are often treasured and held up as hopeful signs of a golden era to come. Yet even these may face persecution by those dynasties that fear change, or whose leaders expect a loss of power once their people are free to spread beyond their reach. In both cases, Transitional Triaxians find themselves in a society where they are visibly different from both their parents and their children, and where their very existence is a weighty portent. Strangely, while Triaxians' mutable nature is perfectly adapted to their planet's erratic orbit, the cycle of physiological changes seems keyed to internal clocks rather than external indicators. Even in situations where these adaptations would be disadvantageous, the small populations of Triaxians who have set up residence on other worlds or planes continue to change in time with their kindred on Triaxus. Beyond their obvious adaptations to their environment, Triaxians are remarkably human. Their basic biology, social structures, cultures, and philosophy-while sometimes surprising to outsiders-all fall well within the bounds of what might be encountered in a humanoid race on Golarion, thus making them one of the least "alien" civilizations in Golarion's solar system. Though the statistics above represent a typical initiate training to become a Dragonrider of the Skyfire Mandate, this is by no means the standard for the race-outside of broad strokes, it's as impossible to describe Triaxians' myriad traits and predispositions as it would be to do so for humanity itself. Triaxians are good and evil, warlike and peaceful, magical and mundane, and everything in between. For more information on Triaxians and Triaxus, see Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Distant Worlds and "Planet of Dragons" on page 64. Triaxian CHARACTERS (10 RP) Triaxians don't possess racial Hit Dice, gaining their capabilities instead from class levels. All Triaxians have the following racial traits. +2 Constitution, +2 Wisdom, -2 Strength: Triaxians are a hardy and wily race, as befits their constantly changing environment, but their lean forms have trouble maintaining large amounts of muscle mass. Low-Light Vision: In dim light, Triaxians can see twice as far as humans. Keen Senses: Triaxians' unique ear construction grants them a +2 bonus on Perception checks. Bonus Feat: Triaxians select one extra feat at 1st level. Seasoned: See above. Languages: Triaxians speak Triaxian (the common trade language of Triaxus). Triaxians with high Intelligence scores can choose any languages they want (except secret languages, such as Druidic).</Description>

Any creature hit by an ursikka's coated claws or grappled by an ursikka using the Snatch feat takes an additional 2d6 points of cold damage (Reflex DC 22 half). Freezing Viscosity (Ex) The saliva that drips from an ursikka's mouth is maddeningly sticky as well as preternaturally cold. Creatures that take damage from an ursikka's bite attack must succeed at a DC 22 Reflex save or become entangled for 1d4 rounds. While entangled, creatures take 2d6 points of cold damage (Reflex DC 22 half). An entangled creature can break free before the end of this duration by succeeding at a DC 19 Strength check or by dealing 15 point of damage to the encasing saliva with either a slashing weapon or with fire damage. Using fire to remove the saliva damages the entangled creature as well. The save DC is Constitution-based. Hibernation (Ex) Ursikkas can enter a state of hibernation for an indefinite period of time, typically until Triaxus's long summer subsides. An ursikka surrounds itself with its spittle, which hardens into a cocoon. While hibernating, an ursikka doesn't need to drink or eat. The cocoon has hardness 10 and 60 hit points, and is immune to fire damage. As long as the cocoon remains intact, the ursikka remains unharmed in its hibernation. An ursikka must use its attacks to break free from its cocoon. Spit (Ex) As a standard action, an ursikka can spit a 60-foot line of its saliva. Creatures struck by this saliva take 8d6 points of cold damage and risk being entangled. A successful DC 22 Reflex save halves the damage and negates the entangled condition. The save DC is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Like enormous, nightmarish praying mantises, ursikkas roam the Triaxian wilderness during the wandering planet's winter years. These vicious, short-tempered predators rule primeval environs by default, being among Triaxus's largest, hungriest beasts. Ursikkas' towering height, which can reach 25 feet, is mostly due to the long, slender walking legs on which the creatures skitter with an eerie speed that belies their hulking size. A long, bloated abdomen accounts for most of the beasts' 20 feet of length. Ursikkas' thoraxes anchor their grasping forearms, which each end in sharp pincers capable of shearing flesh from bone like hot knives cutting through butter. Ursikkas' white, shaggy fur covers the majority of their bodies, and their three-part maws can open wide enough to swallow a human whole. The freezing, sticky fluid that drips from their gnashing jaws aids this activity even further. Ecology Ursikkas are specifically suited to their home planet's long winter season. Their impossibly cold bodily fluids, which allow them to thrive in subzero temperatures, grant them equally cold saliva that helps the beasts kill their prey as well as digest it. Further, the property that keeps ursikkas' spittle liquid at its freezing temperature also makes it incredibly sticky-a quality that aids the creatures in combat and when preparing for Triaxus's hot summer years. During their planet's long winter, ursikkas terrorize Triaxus's large swaths of uncivilized land in endless quests for food. The ravenous creatures require several tons of raw meat each week to survive. Although they prefer to eat the flesh of large, cold-blooded creatures, hungry ursikkas pursue any viable prey, particularly victims that seem sluggish and easy to catch. When the end of winter approaches, the huge quantity of food they consume fuels an increased production of saliva, which they use to prepare their summer abodes. During Triaxus's summers, ursikkas live inside cocoons constructed from their own saliva. In the weeks before the change of seasons, ursikkas choose an inconspicuous locale-such as inside cave complexes or even holes of their own construction-in which to spend the long summer. The creatures then tirelessly weave their spittle around their bodies until they're fully covered. In 24 hours, the chemicals in the spittle harden it into an impenetrable sheath that protects ursikkas from Triaxus's brutal summer heat. Shortly after their spittle-cocoons harden, the beasts go dormant and do not awake until the temperature returns to a more tolerable level. Although ursikkas are known for aggressiveness during the entirety of winter, they are at their most volatile right before and right after dormancy. An ursikka that is interrupted while weaving its cocoon immediately attempts to kill the intruders. An ursikka whose cocoon is broken during the summer emerges similarly enraged; ursikkas that defeat the creatures responsible for waking them attempt to reconstruct their cocoons, but as spittle production ceases during hibernation, those efforts often fail. Some Summerborn Triaxians actively seek out the cocoons of slumbering ursikkas, knowing they can defeat the exposed beasts relatively easily. Habitat &amp; Society With their ruthless predatory skills and voracious appetites, ursikkas typically live solitary existences. However, in places where prey is abundant-such as the wilds of the Drakelands and in the Allied Territories-ursikkas sometimes live in pairs or, rarely, in small hives of three to 10. In such cases, ursikkas still hunt alone. Triaxian scholars note that the creatures don't hesitate to kill each other should one steal another's meal. In accordance with their long life cycles, ursikkas mate infrequently. Once or twice each winter, the larger females of the species typically seek out mates as determinedly as they hunt prey. Afterward, each female lays one enormous, fertilized egg made of a secretion similar to the creatures' hardened saliva. After a 5-year gestation period, the egg hatches. If ursikka parents are even aware of their offspring, though, their behavior does not indicate it. According to scholars, young ursikkas grow to maturity in fewer than 10 years. One disturbing speculation indicates that adult ursikkas sometimes enjoy the flesh of their younger counterparts-and may actually hunt juvenile members of their own species if prey becomes scarce. Whether this behavior is simply a way for adult ursikkas to survive or a warped way for them to retain their territorial dominance is unknown. Although they are very long-lived, ursikkas rarely live through more than two Triaxian winters. In the planet's most isolated territories, where few predators or stalwart hunters threaten them, ursikkas typically die of old age during their dormant period; ursikka carcasses swathed in shimmering, deteriorating cocoons are not uncommon in these frontiers. In more populated areas, ursikkas' lifespans are shorter, especially given the hardy, cold-forged winter cultures that hunt the creatures for protection, thrills, and sometimes meat. Indeed, the warriors of the most populous nations of the Allied Territories consider a slain ursikkas' claws, mandibles, and bulbous eyes the ultimate hunting trophies. Some even make furred armor from ursikkas' durable exoskeletons.</Description>

    <Description>Believed to be native to the Parapet Mountains, wollipeds were among the first beasts of burden domesticated by Triaxians. Some claim wollipeds weren't domesticated initially to be working animals, but rather were herded and bred for their extremely warm and plentiful fleece. In any case, Triaxians have a long history of using these magnificent animals for many purposes, even employing them as mounts in battle. A typical wolliped stands between 5 and 6 feet at the front shoulder and weighs upward of 1,000 pounds. Ecology Wollipeds are social herd animals that subsist on a diet of grasses, leaves, and other plant material. Wollipeds in high mountainous environments obtain much of their food from lichens and mosses, while herds of wollipeds on the plains graze on more substantial fare. Wild wollipeds tend to migrate to more plentiful foraging lands when winter comes to Triaxus, though these can be difficult to find. Domesticated wollipeds, tended to by their Triaxian herders, are found throughout nearly all of Triaxus. Walking on eight sturdy legs, wollipeds are exceptionally sure-footed. These creatures can climb steep mountain trails and march through heavy snow with little effort, and Triaxian cavalry have often charged up scree-choked hillsides to raid fortresses on the backs of armored wollipeds. The great beasts' facility at maneuvering in challenging environments and generally submissive nature have resulted in a long relationship with the humanoids on Triaxus. Wollipeds live for about 15 years, mating and giving birth every 11 months, and can be ridden until the final month of pregnancy. Habitat &amp; Society Wollipeds are social animals, grouping together into herds for protection. When threatened, wollipeds gather in a tight cluster with the young animals kept in the very center of the herd. Domesticated wollipeds are used for casual riding, pulling plows, and walking circles to power wollimills. While other exotic fabrics are available during a Triaxian summer, the mainstay of Triaxian winter textiles is spun wolliped fleece. Wolliped fibers wick water away, and still provide adequate warmth even when soaked, while the variations in coat colors and textures provide a wide array of design options. Like Triaxians, wollipeds exhibit distinct seasonal variance. Wollipeds born during the winter have long, thick, shaggy coats of fine fibers with a hollow core, while those born in the summers have shorter, thinner coats. Rather than the coats of individuals changing, the change happens generationally; winter wollipeds give birth to short-coated summer wollipeds as the planet warms, and vice versa. The process happens quickly, usually beginning in eastern Aylok, though no one knows precisely why. In addition to wolliped fleece, some Triaxian artisans use the ivory from wolliped tusks as a raw material, but this is most common for wollipeds born during the winter, as their tusks are three times the size of those born in summer. Winterborn wollipeds use their foot-long tusks for a variety of purposes. In addition to using them to dig in the ice and snow for deep green tubers, burmoss, and patches of sentient tulbos fungus that stretches beneath the ice, wollipeds clash their tusks together in competitions for dominance within a herd and as part of their mating displays. Wollipeds use spitting as a form of communication as well as for defense. Most wollipeds only spit at one another, typically in the course of their tusk-clashing shows of dominance, but when threatened they can launch a nauseating wad of partially digested fodder at their attackers. Some trained wolliped mounts have honed this nature into a weapon guided by their riders. The dragons of Triaxus have little use for terrestrial mounts, and instead use wollipeds as a consistent source of food. More than half of all domesticated wollipeds eventually feed Triaxus's dragon population, though most wollipeds used for meat are older animals whose fleece has turned coarse and brittle. Triaxians also eat wolliped flesh, but most consider young and healthy animals too valuable to eat except during desperate winter years. Regional Variants The statistics on the facing page represent the most common breed of wolliped native to the Drakelands, the Allied Territories, and the Skyfire Mandate. In addition to these, a multitude of other breeds exist throughout Triaxus. Alurals: Triaxians of the Unbound Tribes breed the best wollipeds for battle, with their steeds recognized worldwide as being the strongest and most aggressive. Alurals are also the only known breed of wolliped that is carnivorous. Tribes here collect wolliped milk, fermenting it into a potent alcoholic beverage used for rituals, feasts, and holy days. Alurals have the advanced simple template. Ningese Wollipeds: The remote nation of Ning breeds the smallest wollipeds on Triaxus. Ningese wollipeds are quick and nimble, using these traits to elude the hordes of monsters threatening the civilized regions of the nation. Wollipeds here are primarily used for fleece and food. In the summer, Ningese wollipeds grow to Medium size and their speed increases by 10 feet. Ningese wollipeds born in the harsh winter are Small and have 2 fewer Hit Dice; their Strength and Constitution decreases by 2, and their Dexterity increases by 2.

    <SpecialAbilities>Gremlin Lice (Ex) Filthy creatures, nearly all grimples are infested with gremlin lice. Whenever a warm-blooded creature comes in direct physical contact with a grimple, there is a 25% chance it contracts gremlin lice. 1d4 rounds after the individual contracts lice, it begins to itch. The itch proves so distracting that for the duration of the infestation, the individual takes a -1 penalty on all concentration and initiative checks. Fortunately, these annoying parasites cannot live long on non-gremlins, and only survive for 24 hours. Submersion in water or exposure to freezing temperatures also kills a goblin lice infestation. Putrid Vomit (Ex) Every 1d4 rounds, a grimple can spit up a 30-foot stream of vomit as a standard action. Treat the vomit as a ranged touch attack with no range increment. Anyone struck by the vomit must succeed at a DC 11 Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1d4 rounds. The save is Constitution-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Grimples are filthy urban scavengers that lurk beneath the eaves of abandoned buildings, clock towers, belfries, and steeples. Sickly-looking and hideously ugly, they shed constantly as a result of the small parasites they host. Quick climbers, grimples also have loose flaps of skin that stretch between their arms and legs that they use to glide short distances. Like most gremlins, they despise humans and show their vengeance by attacking drunks, unlocking stables, torturing guard dogs, urinating in water barrels, and loosening hanging storefront signs so they fall on people. Still, the grimple's ability to vomit at will remains its most unappealing quality. Voracious omnivores, grimples feast off garbage. They frequently target inns, restaurants, and other places where they can scavenge a steady supply of food.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Incorrigible Charm (Su) A blackwood satyr emits an aura of incorrigible charm out to a radius of 30 feet. Any creature that begins its turn in this area of effect must succeed at a DC 19 Will save, or be affected as per the spell charm person. The blackwood satyr can suppress or resume this ability at will. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. Pipes (Su) A blackwood satyr can focus and empower his magical abilities by playing haunting melodies on his panpipes. When he plays, all creatures within a 60-foot radius must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or be affected by charm monster, deep slumber, reckless infatuation, or suggestion, depending on what tune the satyr chooses. A creature that successfully saves against any of the pipes' effects cannot be affected by the same set of pipes for 24 hours, but can still be affected by the blackwood satyr's other spell-like abilities as normal. The satyr's use of his pipes does not count toward his uses per day of his spell-like abilities, and if separated from them, he may continue to use his standard abilities. The pipes themselves are masterwork, and a satyr can craft a replacement with 1 week of labor. The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Blackwood satyrs are an especially infamous breed of fey indigenous to the Verduran Forest, which straddles the borders of Andoran, Taldor, and Galt. They are well known throughout southeastern Avistan for exuding the pleasantly sweet aroma of blackwood tar, from which they gain their name. Though the human population surrounding the Verduran Forest seldom ventures deep into the fey wood for anything other than logging, the blackwood satyrs seem to take perverse pleasure in waylaying noble lords and ladies during their passage down the heavily traveled Sellen River, playing songs from the river's bank to lure vessels closer and enthrall all aboard.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Angry Glow (Su) Once per minute, as a full-round action, the sprites that make up a sprite swarm may coordinate their luminous abilities to create a singular, searing glow. Creatures within 10 feet of a sprite swarm with line of sight must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. A creature that succeeds at its save is dazzled for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based. Concentrated Rush (Ex) Once every 1d4 rounds, if more than one creature occupies a sprite swarm's space, the swarm may use its attack action to concentrate on one of these creatures to deal 4d6 points of damage in place of its normal swarm damage. Other creatures within the horde's space do not take swarm damage that round. Mob Mentality (Ex) As long as a sprite swarm has at least 10 hit points, it retains its Intelligence score and can act accordingly. Even so, it cannot be targeted by mind-affecting spells or effects that target a single creature. If its hit points fall below 10, the swarm is considered mindless as the individual creatures within begin to panic.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>When intruders threaten their beloved homes, sprite guards in large villages are taught to call for their fellow tribe members to form a vicious, enveloping swarm to drive back their enemies. Typically consisting of at least 5,000 sprites, these swarms are known for inf licting pain upon any creatures in their paths. Sprite swarms typically form only when the sprites' village is threatened by a large number of intruders or a single powerful foe; however, the malevolent sprites of Geb are quick to form swarms when faced with intrusion of any kind.</Description>

    <Description>Sometimes termed the "knights" of the agathions, cervinals have gained a reputation throughout the Outer Planes for their battle prowess, noble natures, and admirable wisdom. They stand almost 11 feet tall with magnificent racks of antlers 4 feet across, and weigh over 2,000 pounds. Cervinals manifest from the souls of good leaders, including military officers, regents, and church officials. In the good-aligned planes, they most often serve as generals in battles against fiends, but they also develop strategies to combat everyday evil in the multiverse, secure evil artifacts, and coordinate efforts between agathions and other celestial races.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Brand of the Impenitent (Su) Three times per day, a balisse angel can brand a judged individual within 30 feet. The target must succeed at a DC 19 Will save or be branded with a painless, glowing icon on its chest-usually the holy symbol of the deity or empyreal lord the balisse angel serves. This brand lasts for a number of days equal to the balisse angel's Hit Dice (10 days for most balisse angels). Anyone who attacks the branded target gains a +2 sacred bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls and a +2 sacred bonus on caster level checks to overcome the target's spell resistance. The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Balisse angels, sometimes called confessor angels, appear to good individuals on the horns of a moral dilemma or to those experiencing a crisis of faith. They prefer to guide individuals to their own moral decisions rather than order them to conform to a specific ideal of good. Balisse angels form from the spirits of individuals who have committed evil acts but later are redeemed and die while living an exemplary, moral life. Though balisse angels do not usually remember their mortal years, they retain a strong belief in the power of mentoring and salvation. The role of confessor is a solitary one. Balisse angels rarely interact with their own kind and cherish every minute they are able to spend on the celestial planes. Some balisse angels form long-lasting bonds with the people they have helped; between missions they may travel to visit their old success stories. Often a balisse angel leaves a mortal just as the mortal is beginning to appreciate the angel's company. Reunions are rare, but cherished all the more because of their scarcity. The average balisse angel stands 7 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds; its powerful wings make up the majority of this weight.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Countersong (Su) A choral angel can attempt a Perform (sing) check to counter magic effects that depend on sound. This ability functions as the bard ability of the same name. Harmonize (Sp) When choral angels work together, they can use their complementary voices to create mystical harmonies. Two or more choral angels within 60 feet of one another can use calm emotions or heroism as a spell-like ability, four or more choral angels can use shout, and six or more choral angels can use greater heroism or holy word. Only the choral angel who actually uses the spell-like ability in question must take a standard action to achieve this effect-the other choral angels need only take swift actions during the same round. Piercing Hymn (Su) As a standard action, a choral angel can launch a concentrated blast of sonic energy from its mouth. This attack has a range of 90 feet with no range increment. Any creature struck by a choral angel's piercing hymn must succeed at a DC 17 Fortitude save or be deafened for 1d4 minutes. The save DC is Charisma-based.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Choral angels are vocalists of unparalleled talent, and their singing fill the halls of good deities with soaring hymns and solemn chants. They manifest from the souls of the pious dead who possessed exceptional musical talent and pure spirits in life. Sometimes, mortals who did not possess musical talent but instead held a deep and abiding appreciation for the arts are gifted with this form upon ascending to the good-aligned planes after death. While choral angels are not soldiers and prefer to avoid combat, which many of their angelic brethren relish, these celestials can defend themselves with their puissant voices when need be, creating powerful magical effects that resonate with the purity in their hearts to overcome foes. Choral angels sometimes support astral devas in their duties by visiting the Material Plane bearing messages for mortals. These messages are inevitably good in nature, and it is a joyous event when a choral angel appears to a mortal. If the celestials expect danger or opposition during their visit, they travel in groups called ensembles, and use their harmonizing voices to spread the word of their patron as well as to bolster their allies in battle. If particularly vexed or pressed, an ensemble of choral angels can use their harmonies to devastating effect, obliterating their foes with powerful chants drawn from Elysium or hymns dedicated to the powers of Heaven. Most choral angels stand only 3-1/2 feet tall, and their svelte frames weigh a meager 40 pounds. Their hair is always of a metallic sheen resembling that of rare natural minerals and ores such as platinum, gold, and silver, though some of the oldest choral angels posses hair that glimmers perpetually like emeralds, sapphires, or diamonds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Hone Senses (Su) Three times per day, a spyglass archon can concentrate its attention as a swift action. For a number of rounds equal to its Hit Dice (4 for most spyglass archons), the range of the spyglass archon's darkvision is doubled, it gains a +6 bonus on Perception checks, and it gains blindsense out to a range of 15 feet.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Spyglass archons act as spies in the interests of Heaven. Though as lawful as any of their kin, spyglass archons use guile and stealth to uncover evil's plans and bring reports back to Heaven. Unlike hound archons, who act more as military scouts and sentinels, spyglass archons infiltrate enemy strongholds and observe agents of evil from scarcely an arm's-breadth away. Spyglass archons believe in law as strongly as they do in good, and are careful to act lawfully in their search for information. In places where law forbids a spyglass archon from entering a building and eavesdropping, it may hide in the shadows of public areas or conceal itself near windows to watch for evidence of evildoing. Once an archon has sufficient information to report, it returns to Heaven, where it shares its findings with its superiors. Since their tasks require discretion, spyglass archons train in multiple discreet fighting styles, and are as capable as any rogue of laying a foe low before she even notices the archon's presence. Specialized spell-like abilities aid the sleuths in this endeavor, and they are not above shrouding an enemy in magical darkness before descending upon her. Souls that become spyglass archons are solitary by nature, so they have few qualms about the isolation entailed by work. Most of their missions require intense concentration and skill, and are most easily undertaken by a single individual, but 2 spyglass archons might work together on extremely difficult, multipart missions. Spyglass archons are just over 5 feet tall and weigh almost 120 pounds.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Autumnal Embrace (Su) At will, a veranallia can strike any creature within 30 feet barren or sterile. The target must succeed at a DC 31 Fortitude save or lose any ability it had to reproduce or bear children. This effect can only be removed by a heal, limited wish, miracle, or wish spell. Creatures that magically reproduce are not affected by this ability. The save DC is Charisma-based. Rebirth (Su) Once per day, a veranallia can reincarnate a creature she deems worthy of the honor. The creature's original body decays and sinks into the ground, affecting the surrounding area in a 1/2-mile radius as though with plant growth (enrichment). Over the course of 1d4 days, a white, flowery cocoon emerges from the affected ground and splits open, revealing the newly reincarnated creature inside. Creatures reincarnated by a veranallia always return to life as aasimars. This ability otherwise functions as the reincarnate spell. Spells Veranallias cast divine spells as 20th-level clerics and have access to some druid spells. They do not gain access to domains or other cleric abilities. Winter Sickle (Ex) At will as a free action, a veranallia can create a jagged blade from her hoarfrost-covered vines that acts as a +3 icy burst sickle. One round after it leaves the veranallia's grasp, the weapon melts into a small puddle of water.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Veranallias are among the most powerful azatas known and embody the changing of the seasons, from blossoming spring to dormant winter. They command the growth and decay of plants, control various aspects of the weather, and enrich soil with the remains of fallen foes. A veranallia stands 8 feet tall and weighs about 350 pounds. Beautiful and majestic, the queenly veranallia possesses a form that combines aspects of a feylike woman and the subtle power of nature. A veranallia appears humanoid from the waist up, but where her thighs and legs should be, sprout countless vines, leaves, and various kinds of plant matter instead. These flora represent the life of plants throughout all stages of the year, continually shifting from blooming, verdant colors and textures to crisp, withered specimens and back in a matter of seconds. Veranallias hail from the wildest regions of Elysium, primeval realms where few but the mightiest azatas dare tread. They are creatures of transition, preferring the unpredictable maelstroms of weather at Elysium's edges to the more temperate or consistent regions of that plane. They also have a particular appreciation for areas where one element transitions into another, such as coastlines, geysers, hot springs, and underground lakes. Many among their kind can be found in the lush Field of Broken Tyrants or various heavily wooded forests throughout Elysium; as many as a dozen veranallias are reputed to dwell among the ever-changing trees and plants of the Painted Forest, and it is thought their annual tribunals are actually the source of the eldritch woodland's transformative climate and continually shifting composition. At first glance, a veranallia's lower body may appear to be made of living plants that wrap themselves around her, but these vines are in fact a part of the azata's strange physiology. Despite this, she is not subject to blight or similar plant-affecting magic, and attempts to use such abilities to hinder her inspire a veranallia's ire like little else. A veranallia's vines are incredibly strong and can entwine and crush an enemy as easily as a python would crush a field mouse. These vines often change appearance based on the veranallia's environment, but not always in any predictable or sensible manner. Veranallias prefer the company of other azatas, and may have any number of faithful bralani or ghaele followers. Their fickle natures make it difficult for most other creatures, even other azatas, to interact with them. Lillends are not inspired by the dangerous power of veranallias, and brijidines' belief in the cleansing power of fire does not make friendship with the verdant veranallias easy. While most other celestials concede that veranallias have only the best intentions, most would still rather deal with more predictable members of the celestial planes. Archons in particular find it almost impossible to speak to veranallias, and the noble angels and agathions have trouble following a veranallia's leaps in logic and rapidly shifting moods. Due to their power and inf luence, it takes a force of great evil to slay veranallias. When a veranallia does die, however, her body explodes into a fine glittering dust that covers a radius of up to a mile. This area becomes exceedingly fertile and subject to indeterminate weather. Storms, snowfalls, heat waves, and gentle showers come by turns regardless of the region's usual climate. Veranallias who have died on the evil Outer Planes have left such fertile areas behind, but the soil inevitably becomes corrupted again, giving rise to vile creatures such as sards and spawning vicious weather patterns. Hardy plane-traveling adventurers speak of ancient veranallias living in the remotest corners of Elysium, and claim that these unique azatas possess even greater mastery over the elements than their more commonly encountered kin. Veranallias with the ability to shower entire mountains with lightning or cause heat waves so intense that they turn lakes to sand are spoken of in arcane texts in the Great Library of Harmonious Scripture of Heaven.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Inexhaustible Ammo (Su) An animated tank loads and fires its weapons as a normal tank, but it telekinetically reloads from a supernaturally endless supply of ammunition. Integrated Weaponry (Ex) An animated tank is equipped with three Maxim M1910 machine guns (see page 65) and two Hotchkiss 6 pounders (see page 66) built into its body. It treats these weapons as natural attacks and not manufactured weapons. It cannot make iterative attacks with these weapons. An animated tank has its weapons arranged on all sides of its body and can make three machine gun attacks and one Hotchkiss 6 pounder attack each round. An animated tank's weapons can still be targeted by effects that target manufactured weapons (such as magic weapon spells or sunder attempts), but cannot easily be harvested for use once the animated tank is destroyed. An animated tank is always proficient with its weapons, and its ranged weapons do not provoke attacks of opportunity when fired in melee combat. Telekinesis (Su) The pickled brain that animates the tank possesses a supernatural ability to manipulate its surroundings and reload its armament. The animated tank can use telekinesis as a standard action every 1d4 rounds (caster level 16th). Vicious Trample (Ex) An animated tank's powerful metal treads deal 6d6+18 points of damage on a successful trample.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>The brains of great military commanders and tacticians need not go to waste simply because their mortal bodies have been slain. Preserved in glass vessels, bathed in nutrient fluids, and wired to strange energies and bizarre technologies, these organs are given new life, as their mental talents are preserved and tapped to independently control monstrous war machines. Though the methods, magic, and technology used differ between creators of these hulking engines, incarnations of these creatures typically take the form of captured siege engines and vehicles retrofitted to allow independent control by the pickled brains inside. Animated tanks are perhaps the most dangerous of such animate siege engines. Thought haunted by some, and simply assumed by others to be well-commanded vehicles crewed by crack soldiers, these animated monstrosities are feared and loathed on battlefields across the front. Blessed with incredible armor and the ability to never tire or deplete their stocks of ammunition, these creatures run roughshod over trenches and barricades alike, grinding troops unfortunate enough to fall beneath their tracks to splinters of meat and bone. The tremendous range afforded by their armaments only makes matters worse for those forced to confront the lumbering monstrosities, and finding a weakness within their steel carcasses is nigh impossible. Animated tanks are found in the company of one or more rifle or flamethrower troops; these soldiers are usually either keenly aware of the tank's unique magical animation, or wholly ignorant of its mysterious and taciturn movements as they simply follow their commander's orders without regard to the tank's missing crew. Those hearing the tanks' orders in their own heads, however, instantly realize that something is not quite normal. As animated tanks are built with the armored frames of British Mark IV tanks-a common war wagon on First World War battlefields-few soldiers question the orders of their superiors when tasked with accompanying one of the beasts. Though Mark IV tanks could normally hold a crew of eight, the cabin of an animated tank is filled with strange technological and alchemical devices, allowing only four Medium creatures space to ride inside-that is, if the animated tank agrees to carry passengers. Animated tanks were designed by Viktor Miloslav for use by the Russian Imperial Army, and it is thought that this mad experimentation and blasphemous use of the deceased is what triggered his exile to the cold wastes of Siberia and his imprisonment in the Akuvskaya prison camp. It is ultimately unknown how effective the creations of Viktor Miloslav proved on the battlefields of the Great War, or whether any of the monstrosities survived the war, as their shelled-out carcasses look little different from normal tanks, with the exception of a faint smell of formaldehyde and remnants of broken glass not usually found with tanks of this model. Whether some slumbering beast waits patiently in some forgotten barn or warehouse remains to be seen, or whether brave soldiers have laid this dangerous and blasphemous technology to rest is unknown, but hopefully Viktor Miloslav's mad designs have all been destroyed or lost forever. Variants Viktor Miloslav is rumored to have created variations on the normal Mark V tank during his brief explorations into self-animated war machines during World War I. "Female" Animated Tank (CR 11): So named because it lacked the heavier Hotchkiss 6 pounder guns of its more robust counterpart, this variant makes up for its lack of explosive firepower with a bristling barrage of machine gun fire, being able to make up to five attacks per round with its Maxim M1910 machine guns. The tanks are otherwise identical in most respects, and few find a female animated tank's lack of Hotchkiss 6 pounder guns a relief when faced with its withering machine gun attacks. The "Moving Fortress" (CR 13): Once word of Viktor Miloslav's inventions spread to Germany, the engineers there tried to replicate the effects he'd achieved, though it's unknown to what degree they succeeded. Should one of these specimens have survived, it would have been much more highly armored, built on the base of the German A7V tank-designed literally like a tracked, armored land ship. A moving fortress has 2 additional Hit Dice, and its natural armor bonus is increased by 5. Its single main gun, more robust than the Hotchkiss 6 pounder, deals an additional 4d6 points of damage, and the moving fortress is equipped with six Maxim M1910 machine guns. Construction An animated tank is built by retrofitting a preexisting tank and hard-wiring its pickled brain to the controls through strange technology, rather than crafting the construct's tank body from scratch. The secrets to preserving brains and connecting them to metal war wagons is lost, as is the nonmagical technological process by which Viktor Miloslav constructed the monstrosities found on Earth during the First World War. However, those able to inspect a destroyed specimen may be able to reconstruct the process. In addition to an animated tank's creation requirements-beyond the body of an intact tank-an animating brain must be harvested soon after its body is deceased, preserved with gentle repose, and subjected to a special nutrient bath before being revived and ultimately hooked into the tank. Only time and experimentation will reveal whether other secrets to this mysterious process were lost in the chaos of war on Earth.

    <SpecialAbilities>Aura of Destruction (Su) A genthodaemon can create an aura of pure carnage. All critical threats made against targets within the aura (including the genthodaemon) are automatically confirmed. Dying creatures within the aura take a -10 penalty on stabilization checks. The genthodaemon can activate or suppress this aura as a free action. Barbed Defense (Su) A creature that strikes a genthodaemon with a melee weapon, an unarmed strike, or a natural weapon takes 1d4+4 points of piercing damage from the barbed wire and other pieces of jagged metal embedded in the genthodaemon's body. Melee weapons with reach do not endanger their users in this way. Penetrating Slivers (Ex) When a genthodaemon confirms a critical hit with a claw attack, pieces of its metal nails break off and enter the target's body, working their way toward its heart. When the slivers reach the heart 1d3 rounds later, the creature takes 1d6 points of Constitution damage. The slivers are destroyed by anything that removes curses, diseases, or death effects. Likewise, creatures immune to curses, diseases, and death effects are immune to this ability. Shrapnel (Ex) A genthodaemon can shake loose four large pieces of the shrapnel embedded in its body as a standard action (make a separate attack roll for each piece). This attack has a range of 180 feet with no range increment. All targets of this attack must be within 30 feet of each other. The daemon can launch at most 24 pieces of shrapnel in any 24-hour period.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Genthodaemons are common troops of daemonic armies, resolutely obedient to any greater type of daemon that gives them orders. They personify death in hopeless or futile wars, genocide, and the despair created by long, bloody stalemates where the combatants lose their will to live and forget why they were fighting in the first place. They have almost no role in corrupting mortals, as they are devoid of interest in the fates of most other creatures, but are sometimes called by daemonologists or greater daemons for use in war or their ability to shape battlefields. Any daemon that can summon a ceustodaemon can instead use its summon ability to summon a genthodaemon. A genthodaemon looks like a stereotypical fiend- basically humanoid, but with claws, a tail, batlike wings, and cloven hooves. Metal armored plates, barbs, and spikes cover its body, though these are part of the daemon rather than armor it wears. Its claws are jagged metal shards sprouting from its fingers where nails should be. Genthodaemons are only slightly above cacodaemons and lacridaemons in the hierarchy of Abaddon. A greater daemon may create a genthodaemon from a cacodaemon or one of the hunted (a dead soul trying to survive on Abaddon); however, most arise naturally from war-battered souls who band together as hunted, transforming into true daemons simultaneously when the group has cannibalized enough souls. Genthodaemons show unusual loyalty to others in their band, though this doesn't interfere with their obligations to more powerful daemons. A typical genthodaemon stands over 9 feet tall and weighs 500 to 600 pounds (with much of this weight stemming from the daemon's embedded metal). Ecology Souls that become genthodaemons usually come from worlds where war technology has advanced to allow production of large amounts of metal armor and weapons-particularly worlds where firearms have been invented. When battle grows so such a scope that the enemy becomes a faceless tide, or killing becomes casual and easy at long range, the act of waging war becomes completely dehumanized and soldiers become mere pieces in a perpetual machine. In such grim instances and the seeds are planted to send soldiers' souls to Abaddon. These ties to the craft of war stain the dead soul and the daemon created from it, manifesting as armor plates fused with daemonic flesh, pieces of weapons embedded in its bones, or even remnants of siege engines or barbed wire sprouting from or wrapped around the daemon's body. These elements are part of the daemon, not mere decorations, but any mechanical pieces merely resemble functional items and no longer work (for example, a daemon with a crossbow or rifle embedded in its arm cannot shoot it). Genthodaemons from the same band often resemble each other, including the shape of their metal parts, sometimes because their mortal selves were even in the same army and uniform. Though genthodaemons serve in the armies of all four Horsemen, they are most strongly associated with Szuriel, the Horseman of War. Her military background, strong discipline, and focus on the brutality of war resonates with the core of a genthodaemon's being. Those who (as mortals) were involved in acts of genocide have a morbid fascination with obscisidaemons and tend to follow them. Though genthodaemons were not the instigators of genocide in their mortal lives (which could have granted them higher status on Abaddon), those who participated in such acts feel a fawning admiration for the greater daemons who orchestrated such atrocities. Like other daemons, genthodaemons hate all living things-and to an extent, themselves-and look forward to the death of the last mortal, for on that day they will have no other reminders of their bleak mortal lives and can focus all their hate inward. Habitat &amp; Society Genthodaemons patrol the fortresses, cities, ruins, and wastelands of Abaddon looking for invaders, hostile non-daemons, and gangs of the hunted. Because they usually travel in groups, they are rarely preyed upon by other creatures and only have to face death when deployed as part of a Horseman's army. They are of low status but fulfill a necessary role as soldiers of Abaddon. Greater daemons treat them with the formal respect due their relative difference in rank, much like how a general might treat a common soldier. However, in the wars against mortal life, the Horsemen understand the value of suicidal missions and brazen sacrifice, and are not above sending countless genthodaemons to permanent destruction if it advances the cause of Abaddon. The genthodaemons accept this as their lot and never complain, as protests require effort, will, and the belief that there is a possibility of change-three things these shell-shocked creatures lost long ago. On the Material Plane, genthodaemons sometimes serve daemonic cults that are unworthy of a greater daemon's attention or lacking the power to summon a more powerful creature. As their magic is suitable for war and destruction, they have limited use to mortal cultists not intent on violence.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Unkillable (Su) When reduced to 0 hit points by anything other than a glass or obsidian weapon, a fext is not destroyed, but instead becomes unconscious. Additionally, 1d4 minutes after falling, a fext gains fast healing 1. To be completely destroyed, a fext must be reduced to 0 hit points by a glass or obsidian weapon or, once a fext is rendered unconscious, its head must be severed and anointed with holy water. Once destroyed, a fext dissolves into fine ash.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Any good general forbids mention of fexts among his ranks, but such strictures do little to prevent soldiers from whispering tales of undying officers leading enemy units. These supernatural officers-often the targets of dozens of strikes and attempted assassinations over the course of their careers-never seem to fall to these attempts, and when they do, they return for the next clash unfazed. Soldiers whisper that these undead officers are only vulnerable to glass arrows, glass bullets, or glass daggers. Tales of fexts, usually dismissed as camp folktales derived from soldiers' frustration at failed campaigns and lost battles, are most frighteningly true-a truth living officers keep from the normal rank and file, for it takes a truly strong leader to send his soldiers against an unkillable foe. Fexts are relatively new on the face of Golarion. The Whispering Way is said to be behind the existence of these powerful creatures, which not only possess skills at warfare and widespread destruction, but also excel at the subterfuge and guile necessary to pass themselves off as normal, living humanoids. While these abominations often serve corrupt monarchs or power-hungry and desperate tyrants, some fexts infiltrate good armies and act as horrible warlords, defying their nation's ideals. These fexts use politics and miscommunication to distort the truth of their battlefield atrocities. Though a fext normally acts as a commander on the battlefield, when engaged in combat, a fext favors its martial prowess, intermingling quick strikes and deadly blows with disruptive curses and its energy drain ability. Many fexts enjoy cruel and humiliating alternatives for their curses instead of simply reducing ability scores or the effectiveness of attack rolls-they may choose abstract effects such as having the target's commander view him as an enemy or making the target of the curse appear loathsome to fellow soldiers in order to break ranks. In war zones, fexts never spare a kill, being eager to use their death knell spell-like ability. Also, as they wade through scorched battlefields, they frequently use their speak with dead spell-like ability to discern information about rival armies. Ecology Strange rituals doom a child to becoming a fext, ensuring its twisted immortality. Usually male and usually human, the child is destined from birth to die young, but will shine in undeath as a great military leader. Wicked rites corrupt the child while it's still in its mother's womb, infusing it with a power that burns brightly during its development, only to dim upon reaching adulthood into a spiral of blackness followed by an immediate descent into undeath. Creating a fext requires a caster of at least 15th level who must subject an expectant mother to weekly treatments throughout her pregnancy, consisting of an array of charms, herbs, oils, pastes, and powders. After the child is born, a portion of the preserved placenta must be carried or kept near the fext throughout its childhood, usually disguised as a charm, stuffed into a doll, or worked into a favored toy or memento. Born a strong and healthy child, the fext leads a mostly typical life for a child of its parentage, region, and status, maintaining a keen intellect and hearty physique. These boons in its youth all but guarantee it a powerful place in society, especially in the field of battle. A young fext finds itself enamored with warfare of any kind and usually studies weaponry, fighting styles, and historical battles with a voracious appetite. Some fexts grow up knowing their destiny-or learn of it along the way-and choose to dedicate their lives to preparing for some dark purpose. Upon reaching adulthood, a fext falls ill. With fever rising and a head full of hallucinations, the fext lies comatose for a week. During this time, the creature slowly passes from mortality, its soul hanging suspended between worlds, then crumbling into undeath. The transition from life to undeath yields great benefits to a fext, though some experience shocking revelations during the transformation. Like vampires, fexts decay at a slower rate than most undead, allowing the creatures to feign normal life for at least a decade. During this time, their skin slowly grows pallid and the odor of death increasingly haunts them. As fexts begin to degrade, the creatures employ mundane disguises and use restorative spells to maintain their physical bodies' previous appearance. Maintaining their image, fexts generally keep to their expected behavior and use their given names until disguise becomes too difficult. At that point, they often choose a name from the Necril tongue, granted in a vision during their transformation to undeath. Habitat &amp; Society Fexts have no choice as to where they grow up, but in adolescence and young adulthood, before the transformation takes place, they find themselves drawn to areas of conflict and war. In fact, regions of political turmoil and constant battles are breeding grounds for fexts-the ritual that creates these creatures is performed almost exclusively in war-torn countries for two reasons. First, it ensures the youth grows up knowing the ravages of war, allowing the fext to learn the reality of death early on, just as a child in a more idyllic setting might learn to play make-believe. Second, it places the youth in a position to become a great leader and a strong warrior who strives to lead forces in battle. The ritual for creating a fext is nearly as variable as the path to lichdom, and must be customized for each potential child who is to carry the honor. Some parents are aware of the path their unborn child is destined to walk, but others are manipulated into allowing these foul rites. They remain unaware of what the procedure will do to their child, and being told it will protect the child and make it stronger. Subjects for this transformation are usually children of nobles or families renowned for a lineage of strong soldiers. When those driven to create a fext discover an ideal mother is with child, they pose as midwives or doctors, and work the rites into their regular care, explaining the tinctures and herbs away as beneficial supplements for the mother and child.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Create Trench Zombie (Su) A trench mist can animate any corporeal creature slain while engulfed within its form. The victim rises as a trench zombie (see facing page) in 1d4 rounds and is under the control of the trench mist that created it. A trench zombie becomes free-willed if it is separated from its parent trench mist. A trench mist can animate a number of trench zombies whose Hit Dice total does not exceed more than twice its own Hit Dice. Engulfing Mists (Ex) A trench mist can engulf foes (see the engulf special ability on page 296 of Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2). A creature engulfed by a trench mist does not gain the pinned condition and may move normally-such a creature is not in danger of suffocating, but as long as it begins its turn engulfed, it automatically takes 4d6 points of acid damage and 4d6 points of negative energy damage. A trench mist's vapors obscure all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate targets). The save DC to avoid the engulfing mists is Constitution-based. Gaseous (Ex) A trench mist has a body composed of foul, mustard-colored vapors. This form grants the amorphous defensive ability and allows it to pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, with no reduction to its speed, but it cannot enter water or other liquids. A trench mist doesn't have a Strength score. It can't manipulate or wear objects, and it is treated as a creature three size categories smaller than its actual size (Medium for most trench mists) for the purposes of how wind affects it. Trench Zombie Symbiosis (Su) Because of its symbiotic relationship with the trench zombies it creates, a trench mist shares senses with its animated creatures when they are engulfed within its form, granting them lifesense and making them immune to the concealment the trench mist grants to creatures within and outside of its foggy form.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Trench mists are created anywhere that deadly gas attacks are used for the wholesale slaughter of troops, whether attacks of a mundane poisonous nature, or from the magical effects of spells such as acid fog. Under mysterious circumstances likely born of the horrors of war and the final throes of young soldiers dying before their time, these mists linger over the battlefield, absorbing the departing souls of the slain. This commingling of loosed life energy and strange chemicals grants the miasma a sly, malevolent sentience. Once so born, the trench mist then seeks only to impart misery and share its singular fate with those fortunate enough to have escaped the poisonous attacks that birthed the creature in the first place. As it preys upon the living it absorbs the aff licted into its growing horde of shambling servants. Victims of its acidic mist rise as hateful zombies under the creature's control, and a trench mist that gains a horde of zombies is a dangerous foe indeed. On battlefields where trench mists are known to have arisen, wise commanders arrange cease-fires during which both sides abandon the site, lest their troops succumb to the horrifying fate of their comrades. Part of the trench mist's self-awareness comes from the symbiotic trench zombies it gains as it slaughters its victims, as the zombies under the mist's control retain the abilities they had in life as well as some snippets of their former memories, which all feed into the collective consciousness of the trench mist. This allows the mist to learn and adapt, granting it a relatively keen intelligence compared to other similar creatures, and allowing it to make canny combat decisions and cleverly manipulate its surroundings. Trench mists wander battlefields looking for prey so they can add more shambling zombies to their collective hordes. Occasionally they might even enter inhabited areas to seek out fresh ammunition and armaments for those of their symbiotic undead who may have exhausted their weaponry. When bereft of such foul company, trench mists often persist for years after the tides of war have receded, settling into the soil and slumbering until fresh prey arises. The lifespan of trench mists is unknown, though through this sort of hibernation they very well may be immortal, reemerging without warning at the scenes of ancient battles centuries after they have taken place, whether turned up by an unsuspecting farmer's plow or war waged anew.</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Trench Warfare (Ex) Starting at 3rd level, a trench fighter can select one specific type of firearm (such as a machine gun, revolver, or rif le). He gains a bonus equal to his Dexterity modifier on damage rolls when firing that type of firearm. Every 4 levels thereafter (7th, 11th, and 15th), the trench fighter picks up another type of firearm, gaining these bonuses for those types as well. Furthermore, when behind partial, normal, or improved cover, a trench fighter gains an additional +2 AC bonus from the cover. This ability replaces armor training 1, 2, 3, and 4. Symbiote (Ex) A unique relationship with trench mists grants trench zombies immunity to acid. In addition, when a trench zombie reaches 0 hit points and is destroyed, the mustard-colored mist that animates the creature bursts violently from its damaged form. All creatures adjacent to the trench zombie are exposed to the toxic gas and take 4d6 points of acid damage. If the trench zombie is enveloped within the fog of its parent trench mist when this death burst occurs, the mist's fast healing ability increases by 1 for a number of rounds equal to the Hit Dice of the destroyed trench zombie. The effects of the deaths of multiple symbiotic trench zombies stack.</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>A trench zombie is a rotting creature leaking sulfurous fumes from beneath its acid-burned, peeling skin, and bristling with the armaments it possessed in its horrifying death. Retaining many of the memories and skills it possessed in life, a trench zombie contributes its intelligence into a sort of hive mind for the trench mist that originally spawned it, creating a true symbiosis between the two-a gift the trench zombie repays upon its destruction, when the horrific fumes that granted it unlife go back to the trench mist that birthed it. Trench zombies are foul and vengeful, and are canny enough to lurk within the nurturing embrace of their mother mist, which provides them concealment without impairing their senses. Those seeking trench zombies' destruction typically must enter the engulfing body of a trench mist if they are to ward off the zombies' ranged attacks. Trench zombies are created using the juju zombie template (Bestiary 2 291), but they lose the juju zombie's immunity to magic missile, which is replaced by immunity to acid. Trench zombies also gain the following special ability Symbiote (Ex).</Description>

    <SpecialAbilities>Change Shape (Su)A very young or older gold dragon can assume any animal or humanoid form three times per day as if using polymorph. Detect Gems (Sp) A young or older gold dragon can detect gems three times per day. This functions as locate object, but can only be used to locate gemstones. Divine Aid (Sp)Once a week, a great wyrm gold dragon can call upon celestial powers for aid. This functions as a miracle. Fast Flight (Ex)A young or older gold dragon is treated as one size category larger when determining his fly speed. Fire Aura (Su)An old or older gold dragon is surrounded by an aura of fire. All creatures within 5 feet of the dragon take 1d6 points of fire damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn. An ancient gold dragon's aura extends to 10 feet. A great wyrm's damage increases to 2d6. The dragon can activate or suppress this aura as a free action. Luck (Sp)Once per day an adult or older gold dragon can touch a gem, usually one embedded in the dragon's hide, and enspell it to bring good luck. As long as the dragon carries the gem, it and every good creature within a given radius of it (10 ft. per age category) receives a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws. If the dragon gives an enspelled gem to another creature, only that bearer gets the bonus. The effect lasts 1d3 hours plus 3 hours per age category of the dragon. This ability is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell. Weakening Breath (Su)Instead of a cone of fire, a gold dragon can breathe a cone of weakening gas. Creatures within the cone must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 1 point of Strength damage per age category (Will save half).</SpecialAbilities>
    <Description>Gold dragons are the epitome of virtue. Other metallic dragons revere their gold cousins as the agents of divine forces and the paragons of dragonkind, and often seek them for advice or aid.</Description>
